0,2244618,5.0,1.0,Amazing professor! He is extremely funny during his lectures and his class is pretty easy if you pay attention. I took him at 8 o'clock in the morning and he started my day off with a bunch of jokes. Definitely recommend.
1,2244618,3.0,3.0,I took Mr. Evans and really liked how the class was structured. Very accessible outside of class.
2,2637835,5.0,3.0,Took him for Cost and Managerial Accounting. He's my favorite professor I've had here. Just show up to class and participate and show you're trying/listening. Talk to him outside of class.
3,2637836,5.0,3.0,"A lot of people hate Dr. Hunt. I found him to be my favorite by far. He is brash, but it is typically humurous and if as you're respectful he will make friends with you pretty easy. If you ask for help or clarification he will make sure you're caught up, move due dates if you have other classes, etc. Don't mind the reviews, take Dr Hunt!!"
4,2637836,1.0,3.0,"He is a very weird guy. Was often rude to and bullied students in class. Once another student asked something normal about the GA or office hours, and he was suspiciously secretive and incredibly mean to him. I wouldnt be surprised if he has a mild form of autism spectrum disorder because yes he is a professor but he is super weird and strange."
5,2637836,2.0,4.0,"Do not skip class or else you won't know what's going on. Coding isn't easy, but Dr. Hunt will help you if you ask for it. No tests or textbook, which is nice."
6,2637836,2.0,4.0,Get ready to teach yourself how to code. Dr. Hunt can be really rude.
7,2637836,4.0,3.0,"It's intimidating at first if you know nothing about coding. Be prepared to work to figure it out. Lots of homework, but it can all be done way in advance. He doesn't give tests if you participate in class, but there are a few group projects. Your group members get to rate you on the final project, so if you do no work, you risk failing the class."
8,2637837,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Camors is extremely friendly and knowledgeable, but this class is extremely difficult.  She does move very quickly, so you need to pay attention. Very easy to access outside of class.  If you can keep up with her (which can be hard sometimes), you will probably do fine."
9,2637837,3.0,4.0,No matter who teaches the course is a very difficult class. You have to put in a lot of time outside of class to succeed. Though I will say it feels like she rushes through the lectures and exams are very difficult. 
10,2637837,3.0,5.0,"This is a fairly hard class no matter what, but most of the time Dr. Camors made it harder than it needed to be. She does not have great time management, and she would rush through lectures. She is very accessible outside of class and can help you with almost anything. The test are somewhat hard but she does give you extra credit. Study early"
11,2637837,4.0,4.0,"Intermediate Accounting is a hard material heavy course however, Dr. Camors made sure she was available for her students, and she worked around her schedule and yours. Don't wait until the last second to reach out for help. She will help you just have to reach out. Intermediate is content heavy and difficult, but she will work with you!"
12,2637837,2.0,4.0,This class was not super hard but she made it harder than needed. She has terrible time management and would constantly rush through lectures and not fully teach. I would not take her again because she did terrible getting the information across.
13,2637837,4.0,5.0,"The class is hard. Really hard. The material is dense and you've really got to understand it. Dr. Camors was very nice. Always answers emails and lets you meet with her. The lectures are very boring, but she'll really try to help you. Don't drop the ball in the middle of the semester!! Push through and be prepared to work for your grade."
14,2637837,5.0,4.0,"This is a harder course to take, but Dr. Camors did a great job of teaching it. I had to take this class twice, and with my second try being with her I have done really well in this class. Always go to class, print out the notes, and dont be scared to ask questions! Shes quick to answer emails."
15,2637837,5.0,4.0,This is not an essay class but she is a good teacher. Print out the problems and do them in class. read the textbook before the test. She is very sweet and wants to help but you have to do your part.
16,2637837,4.0,4.0,"A brand new professor, but very eager to improve. This is a hard class, but she is willing to work with you. Lots of lecture material and homeworks. Take every opportunity for points that you can get."
17,475147,5.0,1.0,"Very good instructor, great sense of humor. Makes a boring class, by default, decently interesting. Also, she tends to care about the student."
18,475147,5.0,2.0,"really good teacher, and hot."
19,1785874,3.0,2.0,"the online class was very easy, but there was no interaction with the professor besides a few reminders for exams and a paper. it was all book work"
20,1785874,2.0,1.0,"You have homework every week, but it's impossible to NOT make 100s on those. The test is the exact questions and answers on the study guides. I never listened to the lectures and I came out with an A. If you do show up to lecture, make sure you never pull out your phone or laptop!! He will help students with good attendance."
21,1785874,1.0,5.0,"horrible professor, i would not recommend him to anyone ever. He is extremely rude, not willing to help at all, very vague with all of his instructions, he grades the assignments so randomly and based off of things that are not on the rubric. Please do not ever take him."
22,1785874,1.0,1.0,"He spends most of his lectures complaining about attendance or covering ails material and is very RUDE. For one of the writing projects he gave no rubric and yet many still struggled to do well, and another (that was 10% of your grade) even if the rubric was followed to a tee there was points taken off with no explanation."
23,1785874,1.0,1.0,"Class was not normal b/c Covid but he was terrible and made me stressed. He marked non-attenders w/ Covid absent and was mad they did not come to class. He gave no criteria for projects that are 10% of our grade, then failed people randomly. The class material was EASY and there are several quizlets already out there to study with."
24,1785874,2.0,3.0,"I have tried to be very open with this professor; however, he was very rude and does not respond to emails. We are hybrid and he is very open about his dislike for this. His lectures are long and drawn out. He has a very thick accent that can be extremely difficult to understand. I have made an easy grade because the material itself isnt hard."
25,1785874,1.0,2.0,"He is very rude, especially when you just simply ask a question. He isnt very professional either."
26,1785874,1.0,1.0,"Beware that if you take this course he has a very heavy accent which is sometimes very hard to understand. but, he is VERY rude. he is very unclear when it comes to requirements for papers.. and then you might receive a 0. He does not like to be asked questions. Very inconsiderate. But his work is very easy, easy pass."
27,1785874,4.0,1.0,"His lectures are not what you are tested on and his accent is hard to understand at first, but once you get the hang of it he's cool. The tests are directly off of the study guide literally word for word and the study guide answers are all on quizlet. Study the quizlets and you can literally make a 100 on the test."
28,1785874,5.0,2.0,Attendance is 10% of your grade. The home work which is drop dead easy is 35% The test have a study guide with 150 questions 50 of which are word for word on the test. A lot of the content is very self explanatory with sometimes comicly obvious answers. Only thing is his English is not perfect and he can sometimes be hard to understand during lec
29,1785874,3.0,2.0,Lectures were kind of boring. He's a chill guy though. The homework and tests were extremely easy. Use the study guide and you will get an A.
30,1785874,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Netadj is hard to understand, not only because he has a heavy accent, but because he does not know how to explain the material properly. He is rude to students who had valid excuses for missing a class. This class could be SO interesting if the teacher was even slightly better. Do not take this class or this professor if you can."
31,1785874,3.0,3.0,He is very boring talking. He will put you right to sleep. Buttttt his tests are very easy if you study the answers and questions! Easy A and easy homework every week
32,1785874,5.0,2.0,"I loved his class. He was very funny and seemed to really enjoy teaching us. Attendance is MANDATORY. After 3 absences, it affects your final grade by a letter and absolutely NO phones in class"
33,1785874,4.0,2.0,homework isnt hard to do since theres quizlets for them. so just do the homework it takes two seconds. tests arent hard if you do the study guides (also on quizlet). he takes the test questions from the study guides. its not hard if you go to class and do the work.
34,1785874,1.0,3.0,he is very rude over email . hard deadlines . not lenient . hard to understand .
35,1785874,2.0,1.0,"This class was extremely easy. He gives assigned seats the first week of class by alphabetical order, which sucks, and phones are strictly a no. Attendance is mandatory or he takes points off your grade. Don't take notes because he teaches from power points and none of it is on the test. His study guides ARE the test, in the exact order too."
36,1785874,3.0,2.0,"Attendance is very important!!!! Otherwise, hes ok I guess"
37,1785874,3.0,1.0,"He was a pretty cool guy after all, but first let me explain how everything went... First day of class very boring and you will have a short quiz on the syllabus like 2 weeks later(make sure you read everything on it), the test were super easy, study over 150 questions really just need to remember the answer honestly! and homework was easy online"
38,1785874,5.0,1.0,if you show up to class and use the study guides for the test you are for sure going to get an A! also he is nice and really chill.
39,1785874,2.0,5.0,I did not enjoy this class. He assigns seats and so I was forced to sit in the back of the class where I struggled to see and hear the lecture. He also doesn't seem to cover in class the things that are on the test. His lectures do not flow well and he is hard to follow.
40,1785874,1.0,2.0,"Though the class is an easy A if you do the assignments online and study, he is extremely rude. We were given a hard time when trying to take notes because &quot;we didn't need them if we listened&quot; though he has a strong accent and is hardly understandable. He is unreliable when trying to make up tests, only upside to his class is you get out early some"
41,1785874,1.0,3.0,"This teacher is a huge jerk. His attitude and strictness are hardly bearable. Class is an easy A with homework and test, but that is only if you are able to handle being treated between the ages 5-10. Examples are being yelled at and marked absent if you leave early which is never a problem at a college university and &quot;no phones aloud&quot;. easy a tho."
42,1785874,2.0,4.0,"Attendance is VERY mandatory. During class he would go through a chapter but if you actually want to pass the test, you better read straight from the book. The tests are a lot like the 200+ question study guide. I had to do double the work for this class and ended up getting a lower grade because he lost a quiz that I took."
43,1785874,2.0,1.0,"Hes not the best teacher, but if you actually show up for class and do assignments, then you should be good. The test is easy because the study guide has all the test questions. The only thing with that is, its 300 study guides questions and 50 questions on the test. And hes VERY strict when it comes to attendance."
44,1785874,1.0,2.0,"Worst professor I've ever had at MSU. Don't bother buying the textbook, he gets all of his questions from a test bank and they're all highly specific. When he gives you the study guide, search for all of the questions and you'll find them on Quizlet. I memorized all of the possible answers that way and my test scores went way up."
45,1785874,1.0,3.0,"he is difficult to understand. he assigned seats, so if you have an end of the alphabet name, you have no chance of hearing/understanding him since you will be forced to sit in the back. his lecture is irrelevant to the test, but attendance is mandatory. his study guides are ridiculous, 1000+ questions (unanswered) on SG for 100 question final."
46,1785874,1.0,3.0,You can barely understand him - he has a thick accent AND he speaks quietly. He sits you in alphabetical order and will not let you move. No electronics. No note taking. He uses the full time. 300 question study guides for 50 question tests. 1000 question study guide for 100 question exam. (that are literally nothing you learn in class) Painful.
47,1785874,2.0,5.0,the test have 50 questions and the test review has 300 questions. the final exam review will have 1000 questions. the homeworks are due every Monday and they will take the full hour.
48,1785874,3.0,4.0,"This class is entirely from the book. Attendance is a huge grade, but the lecture material is almost guaranteed to not be on the test. The test questions come directly from the study guides, but the questions are painfully specific. A chapter may be 40 pages, but a tiny detail mentioned in a single sentence will be on the test. Read and go to class"
49,1785874,3.0,2.0,Okae let me tell you about Dr. Netadj. He doesn't speak very clearly and he has a temper. If you try to tell him something isn't right he doesn't listen and he doesn't care. He thinks he's right all the time. Its an easy A but his lectures are long and boring. You will get out of class early. He doesn't like cell phones or computers. He is annoying
50,1785874,3.0,3.0,"Basically, gives the test to you for study guide, but his lectures suck. Reads straight from the slides. Talks usually from beginning of class to end, and will call on people if no one participates. Cannot have phone or computer out. Hard to understand at times."
51,1785874,4.0,4.0,"Your attendance is a major chunk of your grade Study Guides are 300 questions for 50 question tests, so if you have a life outside of being a student, don't take this course He's open and willing to listen to and help students who try their best Some of the homework was tedious, especially after timer being placed on it, you can't return to it"
52,1785874,2.0,1.0,"He's crazy.. He hates phones and computers. He does not hesitate to kick anyone out of class and has assigned seats. English is not his first language so sometimes its hard to understand during lectures. He gives you all the test questions so its an easy A. If you respect him ,he will respect you. Would recommend him because its an easy A."
53,1785874,4.0,1.0,"pros: study guide is exactly like the test, offers extra credit, dr. netadj is extremely passionate cons: he has a temper, absolutely will not allow phones in class, and lectures almost the entire class period every meeting overall, he makes this class super easy on you and gives you all the tools for success, just have to deal with long lectures"
54,1785874,2.0,2.0,"Pros: He seems passionate about what he teaches about, the test is directly based off the study guide  Cons: He is quick to get angry and honestly have an attitude with students, he provide little to no help or forgiveness in any online technical issues, you do have to purchase an online code and textbook, 300 question long study guide each test."
55,1785874,2.5,1.0,"While this class is an easy A, the lectures are long and take up the entire class period every time. He also wants class participation in answering random questions. The test is based on the textbook and they are exactly like the study guide he posts."
56,1785874,1.0,1.0,Easiest class you will ever take but lecture is horrible and you will grow to despise the class. Some of the dumbest rules you will ever come across. Professor speaks too quiet and not good English. Assigned seating. Mandatory attendance. Class is pointless... studied for 2 hours and made a 100 on the test
57,1785874,1.0,3.0,Really easy class. Chapter tests are online and he gives you a study guide based off of the textbook before each exam. Lecture is tough to sit through because there's not really any reason to go to class since everything is online or in the textbook. 
58,1785874,1.0,5.0,He is hard to understand. Most everything is online and the book is MSU custom and comes with a code to do the homework with. For test he just leaves you on your own. Class average for homework was an F.
59,2244632,5.0,4.0,I took organic chemistry with Dr. Nettles over the summer semester. Dr. Nettles has been one of the best teachers I've had at Mississippi state. He's always willing to help and he held office hours after every class. Even if he had a bad day or weekend he always showed up with the best attitude. He makes it fun to learn and retainable. 
60,2244632,3.0,3.0,"I had organic chem II lab under Dr. Nettles. This lab is very similar to organic chem i lab. However, there is a lab practical at the end of it. Study all the labs and reactions and you should be fine. Lab is just very tedious with all the reports to write up and quizzes to take. The practical can make or break you."
61,2244632,4.0,4.0,"I liked Dr. Nettles a lot! Organic is a tough subject regardless of who your teacher is, but he was very engaging and did show that he cared about his students. A lot of people like to complain about his teaching, but he did what he could to make the class bearable and not entirely too difficult. Very good at going deeper in certain topics."
62,2244632,3.0,4.0,"not the best teacher. Didn't explain things very thoroughly and questions on the test were way harder than examples given in class. I read the textbook and recorded the lectures but this barely helped because his lectures were EVERYWHERE. kind of disorganized. Come to class, actively listen to lectures, and do the recitation homework."
63,2244632,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Nettles is an amazing person and a really good professor. He makes the material as easy to understand as he can and answers questions in detail. He is really easy to talk to outside of class. Don't get me wrong, organic chemistry is super hard, but he makes it a little less miserable with his sense of humor."
64,2244632,4.0,4.0,"Good professor and knows what he is talking about, but he speeds through lectures. Office hours come in handy to better understand material went over in class. Attendance has nothing to do with your class grade, he doesnt give bonus points or etc. I personally did not use the book, however, the workbook is mandatory and is helpful when studying."
65,2244632,4.0,2.0,Gave extra credit at the end of the semester for missing less than 3 classes. Easy professor if you have a good chem background already. Kind of speeds through lecture and class let out early nearly every time. Helpful when you ask questions about the subject. Definitely knows his stuff.
66,2244632,2.0,3.0,Didnt like him as a teacher... very difficult class. Do your work on time and stay on schedule
67,2244632,3.0,3.0,"Dr Nettles is a funny guy, but he does not get the point across the easiest way possible, just scatter brained you may say. I enjoyed his class, all chem tests are the same :multiple choice 25 questions. Study hard for the test and understand the material, do good in recitation too, those quizzes matter. He helps your grade at the end too!!"
68,2244632,2.0,4.0,"I received warnings about this class from upperclassmen. Goes through the material quickly. Often times the tests are more complicated than the examples provided. While attendance isn't calculated into your final grade, the extra credit &amp; dropped assignments can really save your score in the end. Possible to pass if you dedicate your time to study."
69,2244632,4.0,4.0,"The first few lectures were really hard so I started videoing the examples he does &amp; writing down everything he said that wasn't in the slides. He wants you to succeed, but it's a hard class regardless. The grading scale is so that an 85-100 is an A, so that helps a lot, and if you miss 4 or fewer days he adds 50 points to the first exam."
70,2244632,3.0,5.0,This was one of the hardest classes i ever took. the lectures had so much material it was hard to grasp it and we had to fly through the slides. hes a funny teacher
71,2244632,4.0,4.0,He is the first chem teacher I've had who's actually good. His lectures are funny for the most part and he will raise your first exam grade if you have less than 4 unexcused absences. Covers material pretty fast so pay attention. You will do just fine in his class if you do enough practice problems; if you don't the tests will kick your butt.
72,2244632,4.0,5.0,"Super funny, very loud. If you miss less than 4 days, he adds 50 pts to your first test. The final is also curved by 15-20%. The tests are all super hard but he does a good job trying to prepare you for them. Has good office hours and helps you during them if needed."
73,2244632,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Nettles made chem 1 very tolerable and about as easy as chemistry could be. It was still a very difficult class just because its chem, but he made the lectures interesting and always worked practice problems or answered questions. My only complaint is that he went through his powerpoints fast, but they are posted online."
74,2244632,5.0,3.0,He made Organic really enjoyable and easy to understand.
75,2244632,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor, He reads from PowerPoint. There are 3 exams and 1 final (mandatory) He is sacastic and loud so you wont fall asleep. Would recommend for both Organic Chem 1&amp;2 ! I took this class with no lab so its possible."
76,2244632,4.0,4.0,"From what I hear he's probably the best chem 1 professor to have. Although he does not convey material in a detailed and effective way and is very fast through lectures, he will slow down and explain in class if you have a question. Will work out questions if you ask him to, if not he'll skip through those slides. An A in this class is 85-100."
77,2244632,3.0,4.0,"Pretty funny teacher, but the tests are God Awful. Not necessarily his fault though, as the Chemistry department writes the tests, not him specifically. Available office hours and works with you. You won't fall asleep in class, the dude's loud."
78,2244632,3.0,4.0,"I wasn't a big fan of Dr. Nettles. His classes are very lecture heavy, and he moves very quickly through material. He doesn't always explain things very well. Dr. Nettles is accessible outside of class, but I found him slightly intimidating. However, if you have questions, he does take the time to explain the answer to you, in class or office hours"
79,2244632,4.0,4.0,V-sauce Michael.
80,2244632,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Nettles is perhaps the friendliest professor I have had so far, and by far the most approachable. That being said, he is definitely not the best at conveying the class material in an understandable fashion. No student can afford to lose focus for a single minute during lecture, and doing so will leave that student hopelessly lost."
81,2244632,3.0,3.0,"While Dr. Nettles does not convey the material the clearest, he is willing to meet with you outside of class and recommend other options that you can learn the material by. Even though he is not a five-star teacher, he is definitely the best chemistry professor at MSU. For CH1213 an A is an 85 or above which is nice."
82,2244632,5.0,3.0,Very funny and entertaining. He makes Organic Chemistry as painless and enjoyable as possible. Gives study guides for tests and gives you bonis points if you work them. I highly recommend!
83,2244632,2.0,4.0,"While very knowledgeable about the subject, Dr. Nettles doesn't convey the knowledge into simple terms the best. His lectures can sometimes feel monotonous, only to be redirected by one of his many fecal matter jokes (They were funny the first time). Although his lectures can be a tad boring, he means well and cares about the student's learning."
84,2244632,3.0,4.0,"I had him for Chem I & II. In Chem II he did away with the bonus for attendance, but still curves. This material is a bit harder, and so were the tests, but he still helps outside of class. The test questions are far from whats in the notes, and that was bc he and the other chem teacher made it together and got questions from the book. DO PRACTICE!"
85,2244632,3.0,4.0,"He's new, so he's learning the ropes, but he does curve, so thats good. I went from a C to an A after the curve and bonus points for attendance. He does go fast through stuff, but he will slow down and explain them well if you ask. But beware of his tests, they are more in depth than the homework or general concepts you see in the notes!"
86,2744349,5.0,4.0,"Hands down the best instructor in the mechanical engineering department at mississippi state. Everything from her lectures to how she works out problems in class is stellar. She truly cares about her students succeeding and goes above and beyond to help the students master the material. If given the chance, always chose this instructor if you can."
87,2744349,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Green is one of the best professors I've had at MSU. She really cares about how her students are doing, but she doesn't cut you slack when all the material given to succeed are given. She gives great lectures that include many practice problems that are similar to what you will be tested on, and she does review sessions for each test."
88,2744349,1.0,5.0,First test was unfair and 90% of the class didnt finish within time. The test seemed more for a 1 hour 15 minute section. Pretty distraught now after studying hours just to fail.
89,2744349,5.0,4.0,"She is a great teacher, her lectures are note taking heavy but informative and the quizzes really prepare you for the tests. She actually cares, she saw students struggling and changed the course to it accommodate that, she added quizzes, more examples, and made the material easier to understand. Also, the extra credit is always appreciated."
90,2744349,4.0,3.0,"Morgan Green was a great professor for EMT. Clearly explained what you needed to know for the hw and exams. Lectures are heavy in notetaking and a lot of the notes are useless, but some can be helpful. Tests are challenging and long but fair if you study and understand the material. First Order lab is worth a lot and can highly affect your grade."
91,2736159,5.0,2.0,"Makes lectures interesting and tests are not difficult as long as you study. Has one big project throughout the semester but it is super easy and half group, half independent. Attendance is a part of the grade but you also get an extra credit opportunity every class day."
92,2621473,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Corrigan was almost completely inaccessible outside of class. He refused to post the course to Canvas, making it nearly impossible to see your grades. He did not stick to his word about being able to make up missed quizzes and admitted his class was comparable to flying business. Do yourself a favor and avoid taking this professor if you can."
93,2490402,4.0,3.0,"Three major writing assignments and two team class presentations. One that's a recorded video and one is your team standing in front of the class. 15% for class attendance. Some class days are ""go home and work on your thing."" Genuinely cares, wants to keep contact after the semester if you need her to review something."
94,2490402,5.0,3.0,Very helpful and gives great feedback on your writing. She clearly puts a lot of effort into the class and it shows.
95,2490402,5.0,2.0,Great Professor! Great at laying out expectations and guidelines to succeed in the class. Group projects won't break you in this class because she grades individually on those assignments too. Try hard on the big assignments and attend class to make sure you don't lose an easy A.
96,2490401,3.0,2.0,Priddy is a good professor. Cares about general knowledge of the subject. Not good with feedback though. Won't really help if you go to office hours and relies on peer reviews for feedback. Homework was hard but tests were easy
97,2490409,1.0,5.0,At all costs do not not take this man. He is half the teacher that any new graduate student is and puts ridiculous questions on his tests. If you dont know something hes very condescending and does not take criticism at all. He always talks about how things are in the field but has never held a job in his life. Do not take Spayde.
98,2490409,1.0,3.0,This is the third class Ive taken with Spayde and he just keeps getting worse. We got a class average of 63 on an open note/book test because he put questions on there that weve never seen before. Spayde is probably the worst and most annoying professor in Mechanical Engineering and simply does not care about his students or their learning.
99,2490409,3.0,3.0,Good professor although bad at feedback. Does not give feedback on lab reports or tests. Reports are graded extremely hard but tests and homeworks are very similar to previous semesters. He also gives extra credit chances that are very valuable. Pretty easy class other than the lab reports
100,2777133,5.0,1.0,Easy A for her Motivation class.
101,1941553,4.0,3.0,"He's a good TA. He will help you out if you have any questions, and in fact, urges students to ask questions. He hardly ever calls on students when they aren't speaking much, but I would highly suggest speaking during discussion section. Usually if you speak up then, he'll give you the benefit of the doubt when it comes to grading your essays! "
102,1941553,4.0,2.0,Talked way too fast and its almost impossible to keep up. Honestly I only went to class because he is really nice to look at. Hes very knowledgeable but I didnt appreciate his northern sense of humor. A bit too liberal for my taste. The tests are fair I guess and I had a great t.a. 
103,1941553,4.0,3.0,Talked really fast and there was a TON of information. But he is interesting and funny. Some of the slides and jokes were hilarious. Pretty handsome guy too.
104,1392689,5.0,2.0,"I wish I could take Ms. Nation for all my classes! Her lectures are easy to follow and relevant to the homework and tests, so there aren't any surprises. Unlike a lot of professors for the online education department, she doesn't rely on MathLab to do all the work for her. She responds to emails quickly and is kind. "
105,1392689,4.0,2.0,"Ms. Nation is amazing. I love her! She made math easy to understand. Sometimes I genuinely felt like I was in a 3rd grade math class because she teaches like an elementary teacher, but that made everything so easy to understand. She records her lectures, but I recommend going in person. We need more Julie Nations in the world. "
106,1392689,5.0,3.0,Great instructions for the class. Good lectures (online videos). Extremely quick responses to email. Homework and lectures matched content on quizzes and tests - no surprise questions. Clear about what to study for tests. 
107,1392689,1.0,3.0,Refused to meet with me outside her office hours even though I had class during all of hers. Takes forever to answer emails. 
108,1392689,5.0,1.0,"I have never been good at math, but I finished with a 100% in this class. She provide blank notes to print and fill out. Her lectures rarely lasted the entire class time.  Her test were very simple, nothing unexpected. She also drops several quiz grades at the end of the semester. I enjoyed this class more than any other so far."
109,1392689,5.0,5.0,One of the best professors ever! Literally the first time I have ever made an A in a math class. She has all of her notes ready for you to print out and taking notes on them is very straightforward. She is so kind and caring about all her students. She never made class too long and tests very pretty easy and also straightforward!!!
110,1392689,5.0,2.0,"I loved this professor, she really cares about her students, and she should be the example for other college professors. Gave very clear lectures and made the class super awesome. Never had an A in any math class other than hers. Made the content easy to understand and actually taught. "
111,1392689,5.0,1.0,This is exactly what every college professor needs to be like. She made her classes very stress free and gives you lots of help. She is hands down my favorite professor here at Mississippi state. Her study guides were exactly what was on the test and she gave us everything we needed to pass and be successful. 
112,1392689,5.0,2.0,"The BEST professor I had all semester!!!!! She was real, funny, and very understanding. I wish all my professors were like her. I have never ever had an A in a math class before until her class!"
113,1392689,5.0,1.0,"The best professor I have ever had. She understands how to use technology, explains material so well, attendance is not mandatory. She is very kind and caring and super easy to talk to. I highly recommend her. Every professor should take notes from her!"
114,1392689,5.0,2.0,"LOVED HER! She explained every little detail, gives you 2 quizzes a week (online), and 3 test (in person). Very easy to understand and very helpful. I definitely recommend taking her classes. "
115,1392689,5.0,2.0,"Over-explains every little thing but makes sure you do good on tests. Can use notes on her quizzes and for most tests, she will give you the formulas you need to know."
116,1392689,1.0,4.0,Worst teacher I have ever had. I signed up for a lecture class and decided to post videos and only allow us to ask questions during class time. When students did come to class she wouldnt even give us the whole class time. She would cut us off and say she had to go. She 100% used the pandemic to take the easy way out of her job. -10/10 rating
117,1392689,5.0,4.0,"I took Professor Nation for College Algebra. SHE IS THE BEST. Not only did she ensure her class was easy to understand, but she was incredibly understanding when the world shut down mid semester due to the pandemic. I lived in Seattle and couldn't get a proctor for my last two exams. She assured me that no matter what we'd make sure I got to finish"
118,1392689,5.0,1.0,"She's a really caring teacher so if you ever feel confused, she's more than willing to go over more problems with you to better explain it. She also is good at sending reminder emails when it comes to test and homework deadlines."
119,1392689,5.0,1.0,Mrs. Nation is an amazing professor!! She is very caring and wants you to succeed. I did not use the textbook at all because she posts what we need.
120,1392689,5.0,2.0,She is amazing. Class is really easy just show up and do homework. If you miss class she posts the notes on Canvas
121,1392689,5.0,2.0,An absolute sweetheart and and a really good teacher. She makes the material easy to understand and posts her worked notes if she sees the class is taking their own. Trig is hard but if you pay attention in class and practice using the homework/quizzes you'll be good.
122,1392689,5.0,3.0,My actual favorite person ever. This woman is the BEST professor you will ever have. I took her for college algebra and loved her then I saw she was teaching trigonometry and took her again. I did get a B in trig but that was my fault. She is an amazing professor and i would take her again if I needed any more maths.
123,1392689,5.0,3.0,"Love Ms. Nation!!! MyLabsPlus is so easy to use, you always know what your grade is. Ms. Nation always goes over old exams the day before one, which theyre basically what youre going to be tested on. Just go to class and pay attention, and youll pass."
124,1392689,5.0,2.0,"Very sweet teacher. Her notes are good, but she does throw questions on the tests that she did not cover in lecture. Very responsive, though, and will gladly help you out with any questions you have."
125,1392689,5.0,2.0,Very Sweet Very Easy
126,1392689,5.0,2.0,"Love her! She is great, teaches the material very good, and if miss 3 classes or less you get extra credit! Easy A"
127,1392689,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Nation was really nice and really wants to make sure you understand the material. Don't buy the textbook, just get the my math labs plus online access for homework. She gives you the blank notes beforehand so you can print them out and follow along in class. Easy A if you pay attention, get homework done, and come to class."
128,1392689,5.0,2.0,Love love love Julie Nation. The class itself is easy if you took algebra II in high school. I didn't get the textbook and all was fine
129,1392689,5.0,1.0,"Love, love, LOVE her!! Ive never had an easier time in math class!! She keeps mine and everyones attention and does many examples of the material to explain it. I would love to have her as my professor again!!"
130,1392689,5.0,2.0,She is a great teacher. She is very accommodating with students being in student support. She makes the class interesting and gets to the point. She does make you do a couple of project but they are actually really fun. I really enjoyed this class even though I don't like math. I highly recommend her.
131,1392689,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Nation Is an excellent professor, as she makes the material easy to understand, and always ensures her students know what they need for tests/quizzes. She teaches at a steady and fair pace, not rushing through material and not lingering on anything long enough for students to lose focus."
132,1392689,5.0,4.0,She is an amazing woman. She cares about you and makes sure you get it.
133,1392689,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Julie is probably the best math teacher I've had. I struggled in math a lot in high school, but this class made it easy. She does do drop grades which are really helpful. Math times were a pain, but it does help you get your work done."
134,1392689,5.0,3.0,"I have always struggled in math, but after being in Ms. Nation's class, I learned things i should have learned in high school. Incredible teacher, just do your work. I missed a few deadlines because I forgot about having to take my quizzes in the Math Lab, otherwise would have had a better grade. Taking her again in the fall."
135,1392689,5.0,3.0,"Shes a great teacher. I have struggled with math my whole life and passed with a 97. She teaches clearly and the homework really helps too. She gives a lot of drop grades at the end of the semester too. She has blank notes online so you dont have to buy the book, and if you pay attention in class, she posts the worked notes online"
136,1392689,4.0,3.0,Ms. Nations class was very straightforward and easy to follow. Definitely my easiest class all semester.
137,1392689,4.0,4.0,"Julie Nation will assist you only if you ask, there is not too much asked except practicing and mastering the material. Forewarning, do not slack up in this class it is very easy to go from an A to a C and hard to redeem yourself with our making A's on tests."
138,1392689,4.0,2.0,"She is really low key funny. Teaches the whole time but usually finishes early. Gives one homework assignment each week and they are sometimes long. Easy class and very helpful. Never made below a 90 on a test, quiz, or homework. Definitely recommend taking her."
139,1392689,1.0,4.0,All I can say is blah. She doesn't warrant more than that.
140,1392689,5.0,1.0,I would defiantly recommend Mrs. Nation! She is an amazing person and makes her classes enjoyable. The textbook has the notes in it so buy it! Mrs. Nation tells you exactly what you need to study and the study guide even mirrors the test. Her class was the easiest math class I took. She explains everything very well and cares about students grades!
141,1392689,4.0,3.0,"I found her to be a great teacher, her lectures were easy to understand and follow. She has lots of drop grades and the tests are very easy as long as you pay attention in class and attend on the review day."
142,1392689,5.0,3.0,I took this class first semester of my freshman year and i really liked this professor. she worked out the problems in a way they were really easy to understand and she gave a lot of droop grades at the end of the semester. it was pretty easy as long as you listened in class and printed out the notes everyday. i received an A without stressing hard
143,1392689,4.0,3.0,"Nation was a solid professor.  She was clear and helpful if you had a question.  I had to miss a test for a scholarship event and she was incredibly accommodating.  She can go a little fast, but if you ask questions, she'll take the time to answer them."
144,1392689,5.0,3.0,"I had taken Trig in High School, but she taught in a way that really made me understand the concepts much better. My decent-at-best grade in the course is mainly because I forgot about some of the online assignments at times, but she truly is a really great teacher."
145,1392689,5.0,3.0,"I took Julie Nation for Trigonometry. I had already taken Trig. in high school but she explained things in a new way that helped me to understand the concepts more. If you have the option to take her class, TAKE IT!!! She's a great teacher and genuinely cares about you passing. She does get really mad when you scan in and leave though."
146,1392689,5.0,3.0,Very straight forward.  Gives good examples and answers questions if you have any. Good attitude as well
147,1392689,5.0,2.0,She's very straightforward & will post notes if you behave in her class.
148,1392689,4.5,1.0,Great teacher for trig. very clear and easy to understand. She does a great test review and basically tells you exactly what to expect on the test. She gives 5 bonus points on a test for missing 3 or less days. Take her!
149,1392689,4.5,2.0,"She is a really good professor. Sometimes I struggle with math, but she was very good at explaining the lessons very clearly so I am passing with an A. She even occasionally throws some jokes out in the lectures to keep everyone awake. Highly recommend this professor, especially if you have trouble with math. "
150,1392689,5.0,1.0,Julie Nation is the best Trigonometry teacher there is. She is very easy to understand and makes all of her lectures very understandable. If you show up to class and pay attention then you will do well.
151,1392689,4.5,1.0,"Math is easy for me, but I admired her ability to break down the problems for the students that needed it. She does a wonderful job explaining every concept and tries to keep her classes engaged. "
152,1392689,4.0,3.0,Most of the classwork was online so you had the chance to be walked through problems over and over. She was very clear during the lectures as well. If you take good notes you don't need to buy the book of them.
153,1392689,3.0,3.0,She has almost zero office hours. I usually don't complain about that but when she won't pass the tests back in class and says that you have to come during her office hours to pick it up it causes a problem. When I tried to schedule a different time she told me no and it seemed to trouble her to make a different available time. 
154,1392689,4.5,1.0,"She is nice and very clear with her lectures. You buy guided notes. Test, quizzes, and homework are online and very easy. Should be a really easy A. She's funny sometimes. Definitely  would recommend her and take her again if I could. Get into this class for sure. "
155,1392689,5.0,1.0,She is an awesome teacher. Extremely nice and an easy class. She explains everything and has study guides. 
156,1392689,5.0,1.0,I absolutely loved this class. She explains everything really well and is super helpful if you have and questions or need help. Take this teacher she is the best!
157,1392689,3.5,1.0,Very easy class- she works out examples of all the problems on the projector.
158,1392689,3.0,1.0,All she does is stand and work problems from the problem. Attendance is not even necessary as the online homework teaches how to work the problems better than she does. All notes needed she posts on line. Very easy material and an easy teacher.
159,1392689,4.5,2.0,She's really nice and explains things very well. She goes through every step of the problem so you can easily understand how to do the problem. It's an easy class and she does a great job teaching.
160,1392689,5.0,1.0,Mrs. Nation is one of my favorite teachers!  I have always had trouble with math and she has helped me so much.
161,1392689,5.0,1.0,"I had her for College Alg. and Trig. because her class is just so easy and she is very clear in explaining everything. She is super nice, and eager to help. Def. the go to math prof. on campus. Two Thumbs Up. I'd def. would take her class again if I needed another math."
162,1392689,5.0,1.0,Easy class and teacher.
163,1392689,3.0,1.0,Her class was so easy i could have passed without going to class. However she knew what she was talking about but had no passion behind it. It was an easy class easy grade.
164,1392689,3.5,1.0,"Not very interesting, but finished class early. Did not seem like she liked being there and also was not helpful. Very smart and was easy."
165,1392689,1.5,3.0,Worst teacher I have ever had. She goes over maybe eight problems and class is over. I have witnessed on numerous occasions students with their hands up and never even aknowledged.
166,1392689,4.0,1.0,She is the most awesome teacher ever!  Except for maybe Mr. Banik. He was awesomer.
167,1392689,4.5,1.0,She is very clear and works out each problem slowly. You can use notes on her quizzes and the tests are super easy!
168,1392689,2.0,2.0,She stands behind the microphone and lectures- there is nothing else possible to comment on.
169,1941558,3.0,3.0,"he can be moody at times but he's really into what he teaches and that's what i liked about the class. you definitely have to work for your grade. There is help if you ask, but don't wait until it's too late."
170,1941558,3.0,4.0,"Lets class out early and sometimes cracks bad jokes but that's about it.  He doesn't really seem to care about being there.  The tests contain random facts from the book that no one remembers.  Definitely not an easy A, but if you study hard and work for it it's possible."
171,1941558,1.5,5.0,"He's the worst professor I've ever taken, he is no help, doesn't enjoy kids nor teaching and is always in a bad mood. You have to come to class to pass and even at that if you're struggling he doesn't care. Not very personable either. "
172,2269245,4.0,2.0,Mr. Nick is a great teacher that really cares about you. You can talk to him almost anytime and he will email back quickly.
173,2269245,5.0,2.0,"Nick Hyer is one of the best professors you could ask for, because he genuinely cares about what he is teaching! To be fair, the subject matter of the class can be pretty dull, but it sure doesn't feel that way based on Nick's enthusiasm level! 10/10 would recommend."
174,2269245,5.0,1.0,Mr. Nick is a great instructor who genuinely cares for his students. His lectures include lots of useful information that is highly applicable while giving assignments that are extremely relevant. His class is an enjoyable experience and I would highly recommend taking him if you have the opportunity.
175,2269245,5.0,3.0,Nick is amazing! Truly cares about his students and teaches you valuable college skills.
176,2269245,5.0,2.0,"Nick is great. His classes are fun, interesting, and make you want to show up!"
177,2269245,5.0,3.0,He is awesome
178,2269245,5.0,3.0,Mr. Nick is great! The things we learn in his class can be applied to not only school but life in general
179,2269245,5.0,2.0,"Great person overall, and you can tell he enjoys his job. Makes you want to show up every day"
180,2269245,1.0,3.0,Nick's class is fun while at the same time informational. Attendance is required but where is it not these days? He makes you want to go to class.
181,2269245,3.0,4.0,"Instructor Hyer lacks a bit of structure, but he wants the best for his students."
182,2474052,5.0,2.0,"Candace is one of my favorite human beings. She is caring and she encourages you to your best. She answers all questions kindly- including lots of dumb ones. The class does require work outside of class, but it's fun. She is a photo nerd and she's funny and young and easy to love. HIGHLY recommend!!"
183,2424903,5.0,2.0,Professor White was the best English Professor I have ever had! She takes the time to help everyone in anyway she can so you better understand the material. I would really advise taking her.
184,2424903,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, nice and funny. Grades things on time. Met the LOML in this class."
185,2416715,1.0,4.0,"The best lectures were the ones I slept through. Lectures are hard to follow and powerpoints... well they are not good. Weekly quizzes, make sure you study a few minutes before class. Tests are hard for intro type class, but study and your be alright. Never read the text and easy A. She was also way to political."
186,2416715,4.0,2.0,"Personally, I liked Dr. Melo. She seemed unenthusiastic about class at times, but I genuinely liked and engaged within the class. Quizzes weekly, so make sure you understand what was done in class. Pay attention to small details; she often tests you on those. Other than that, it was a pretty good class."
187,2416715,4.0,4.0,She is great. Had her for medical anthropology. She keeps the class fun. No test but lots of papers and readings. It is manageable just read. She is heavy with participation. She is a genuinely nice person and ready to help.
188,2416715,1.0,4.0,DO NOT TAKE HER. Quizzes every (sometimes twice) a week. They are in depth and really hard. You have to completely understand EVERYTHING (which is crazy for an intro level class) Her powerpoints are so hard to follow - they are all over the place with tiny little writing. She takes the full hour 15 and sometimes even goes over. Worst class ever.
189,2416715,1.0,5.0,"Weekly 10 question quizzes on lecture and textbook readings (which is a lot if material for a short quiz). Constant note-taking and powerpoints are NOT posted online. For tests you can not just memorize a definition to a word or topic. You have to understand it completely. Also, In my personal opinion, the class gets a bit too political as well."
190,2416715,1.0,5.0,Trust me. Dont take her...
191,2416715,1.0,4.0,"Weekly quizzes that are half your grade. No electronics in class. Notes on paper from her PowerPoints. Get ready to read, quizzes and tests come from stupid small details in the chapter. Lots of extra credit that you cant attend because of other classes. Wouldnt take again."
192,974931,4.0,4.0,"His accent is a little hard to understand at first, but you get used to it. He truly cares about his students and is always willing to help. His tests are hard but fair, and he always seems excited to be teaching. Definitely not an easy A, but I would recommend him to anyone."
193,974931,4.0,2.0,"Get ready to use the book - he teaches almost word-for-word by it. He laughs a lot, and is very honest. He's more than happy to answer questions. Optional homework after every lecture. Sometimes he lets you write down theorems on a sheet of paper for tests. Show all your work. The only grades were the tests and some bonus points for attendance."
194,974931,4.0,1.0,His accent is a little difficult to understand but you get used to it pretty quickly. Takes the time to explain problems thoroughly if students are confused. Very helpful and a good teacher.
195,974931,1.0,5.0,"I dont understand anything, teaches very fast"
196,974931,1.5,5.0,"Very difficult to understand. Cannot tell the difference between linear and non linear. If you get him, run away!"
197,704597,5.0,5.0,"Amazing teacher, gives extra credit for test corrections and is always available outside of class. At times his lectures can get pretty in depth but the tests do not go that deep. Would take again"
198,704597,5.0,4.0,James Dunne is hands down one of the best professors I have ever had. You get a chance to do test corrections on every test for extra points. He drops your lowest 2 homework grades and your lowest 4 lecture quiz grades. I would definitely recommend taking him for Honors Physics 1.
199,704597,3.0,5.0,"He cares about his students a lot, but he is just too smart to teach the subject. He knows the material REALLY well, but he doesn't dumb it down very well to teach undergrad students. He's an overall great guy and is always willing to help outside of class, but his tests are very hard and have no mercy."
200,704597,5.0,3.0,He is a really good teacher.  He enjoys the material he is teaching and it shows.  He is very accessible outside of class and explains concepts very well.
201,704597,5.0,3.0,"He is probably my favorite professor I've had so far. Though sometimes we went through the material pretty quickly, that's just the nature of the subject. There's no way to cover the material at a slow rate. He has many homework and exam review sessions and gives 10 points on an exam just for corrections. He wants his students to succeed."
202,704597,4.5,3.0,He's the kind of guy who would pay your tab at the bar if you tried all night to stop drinking. He'll give you ten extra points for doing exam corrections. Always willing to meet with you and respond to emails. Explains things until you understand them. 
203,704597,3.0,5.0,"You could tell he enjoys the subject, but he just doesn't spend enough time on the material. He flies through it, and expects you to understand it without very much explanation. When working out example problems, I found him wandering off on many tangents, making it very difficult to follow and understand the problem."
204,704597,5.0,3.0,No Comments
205,704597,3.0,4.0,"If you have never had Physics, do not take this professor. I found him going through the material quickly and rambling. Do your homework to do well in the class. The only good thing about the class is he gave extra points on exams and you have a lot of quizes."
206,704597,5.0,3.0,"People are stupid.  They don't understand him because they're lazy and don't care about Physics.  This guy does an EXCELLENT job at teaching and focuses his attention on where the class stands at a whole.  Lecture and in-class quizzes are a little difficult, but once he shows you how to work them out, it's made VERY clear.  Definitely get this guy."
207,1646683,5.0,1.0,"I can't say enough good things about Mrs. Kate. Hands down, by far the best teacher on campus. She loves what she teaches, and she makes the class fun. Mrs. Kate gets to know each student personally. She never keeps the class the whole time, and the speeches are nothing to worry about. I plan to take her for every class she teaches at State!"
208,1646683,5.0,1.0,Great teacher! I had her for Intro to Comm and she usually never kept us the entire time. Speeches are nothing to worry about in the class.
209,1646683,5.0,1.0,"I actually had Mrs. Covich at EMCC while she was helping teach a night class. She was great! Very helpful, very nice, and not hard to look at (BONUS!) I hope to see her next year when I transfer to State. Even if you are only taking the class for the hours, she is definitely the teacher you should try and take it under."
210,1646683,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Covich is a great teacher. Her personality honestly made the class. She never kept us the whole time, but we covered everything that we needed to. 2 tests, both very easy. Only one speech and one project. Take her class, you won't regret it!"
211,704610,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Johnson was the best teacher I had in my academic career. If you want to know what math is all about,  at root, take this course and work hard. I took it in the early 2000s, then a couple others from the Dr. Johnson. Those three courses, difficult though they were, are among the top 5 most influential courses I took as a grad or undergrad."
212,704610,2.5,5.0,She is very tough and writes long explanations of the material on the board.  I did not feel she was helpful because she always answered questions in the rudest way possible.  Modern Algebra is already a difficult class meant to challenge an individual but she expected everyone to understand it from the beginning.  Would not take again.
213,704610,3.0,4.0,"Nice enough woman, but pretty tough.  Definitely knows what she's talking about but not the best at explaining things.  She'll help you if you have a specific question, but if you're missing a concept you'll have to ask another student.  Don't despair if you have to take her class, but go with Dang or Fabel instead if you can."
214,704610,3.5,5.0,"Honors Cal II.  VERY hard and VERY frustrating. She's EXTREMELY helpful, but it takes a long time before she finally gets her point across, and she makes careless errors frequently in her arithmetic.  Good teacher and she knows what she's talking about almost perfectly, but she does an almost piss-poor job of explaining it to her students."
215,1007723,3.5,2.0,Probably the easiest English teacher at  MSU.  Grades papers incredibly easy.  Some of my papers were kind of BS and she still gave them A's. Also a decent bit of extra credit.  Would definitely choose Miss Gordon over anyone else.
216,1007723,5.0,3.0,"Really great teacher- one of my favorites this semester. She invests time into individual students, gives extra credit opportunities, and has a great sense of humor."
217,1007723,5.0,2.0,"Jen was wonderful! Yes, she grades your papers EXTREMLY hard, I jokingly called her a comman nazi. I love her and took her class twice. Very helpful and misses a lot of class. :)"
218,1007723,5.0,2.0,GREAT! and so much fun too!
219,1007723,5.0,1.0,"Jen was a great teacher. She grades hard on papers so CHECK YOUR GRAMMAR OVER AND OVER. She's overly nice, I showed up to class more times in two semesters than she did, and she's always up to help you after class. Amazing woman."
220,2580593,5.0,2.0,Dr. Dozier was great! This class is super easy but you learn a lot. Her lectures align perfectly with the exams. If you review the study guides and look at the case studies for each chapter you will for sure have an A in the class. She explains the subject so well and I would love to take her for another class in the future.
221,2580593,5.0,1.0,"She's just great. Review is the test. Easy A, but still funny, sweet, and an all around fun class to attend. Would take all over again if I could!!"
222,2580593,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Dozier was wonderful. You do not have to be in class to do well in this course, but it was always a nice class to sit in on. She loves teaching, and the information is interesting. I can honestly say that I bought the textbook, and used it maybe once. She does use case studies out of the book on the tests, but if you know the info, you're good"
223,2580593,4.0,3.0,"I had Dr. Dozier for Abnormal Psychology. She was a very nice teacher with great lectures. Her class was pretty easy and she was very organized in how she structured the course. My biggest piece of advice for her class is to pay attention and take detailed notes, study, and get the textbook!"
224,2785401,3.0,3.0,its a good class. Kinda a lot of busy work. the food testing is fun. keeps us the whole time. tests are worded weirdly and very specific
225,2711675,5.0,3.0,"Pretty easy class! He gives all the notes you need. Look over them before every test and you'll be set! Quizzes can be retaken! Just do the discussions and work, and you'll pass easy!"
226,2310283,4.0,2.0,"This class was graded pretty much just by tests. His lectures were very disorganized, he just kind of spoke his mind. Although, he is hilarious and a really nice guy. I personally was a big fan of him. The tests were kind of hard, but not too bad. "
227,2310283,3.0,2.0,"He doesn't use powerpoints so he is just talking, if you miss class he expects you to be able to get the notes from your classmates. The tests aren't hard as long as you read the articles. He is not the easiest to reach either. The class itself wasn't terrible it could've been better though."
228,2310283,5.0,2.0,"The most laid back professor I have ever had. He gets straight to the point during lecture and does not waste your time. He appreciates people who actually show up to class. News article quizzes every week but read the articles and you will do fine. Gives some extra credit. Don't ask for extra credit because at that point, you will get none."
229,2310283,5.0,3.0,One of the funniest professors I've ever had. Easy grader and fun to listen to in class. Will definitely take him again!
230,2310283,5.0,2.0,He's a great professor! I recommend him 100%. He makes the class easy. The tests are online.
231,2310283,4.0,1.0,"There will be article quizzes due every Friday only available on Fridays due by 5PM. Do NOT miss the test and quizzes and you will be fine. He won't respond to you and you must email your GAs for everything. The class is boring, but easy A. Typically lets you out early. No final. Attendance is not mandatory due to Covid."
232,2310283,5.0,2.0,I loved his class!! Best choice for History! His lectures are very interesting and fun to listen to. He always cuts class short by 25-30 mins! Take good notes and the tests are online at the time of your class but you can take it anywhere! One of my favorite professors!
233,2310283,5.0,4.0,This has been one of my favorite classes at MSU. The textbook is free and not mandatory to read. The quizzes are easy as long as you closely read the articles given before the exam. The midterm and final are tough but as long as you have attended class and studied you should pass with flying colors. This is a class that everyone should take.
234,2310283,4.0,2.0,"My favorite professor. Super funny and tries to make government as interesting as he can. He emails you a &quot;free textbook&quot; at the beginning of the semester and it's a list of articles that he bases each lecture off of. For quizzes, he emails you 10 articles the week before and that's what the entire quiz is on."
235,2580627,5.0,2.0,I've taken him for Health Psych and Motivation and I really like his classes. Tests are straight from the book and are open note. Has a small assignment due each week but they don't usually take any longer than 15 minutes. One big paper at the end of the semester that he gives you time to prepare for. Understanding and easy-going.
236,2580627,5.0,2.0,"took health psych with him and he made everything super straight forward. if you have a heavy course load and need a less stressful psych elective, opt for this"
237,2580627,5.0,2.0,good lectures. made class really easy and straightforward which was really important during Covid. take motivation with him for sure.
238,2580627,5.0,1.0,"There is a partial grade for attendance. I did not really use the book. There is an article critique paper, but it is not a big deal. He's nice and fair. There are extra credit opportunities in class. He gives great study guides. I think you have to actively not try or care to do poorly in his class. He posts slides online too. Not too many quizzes"
239,1040532,1.0,5.0,"He really understands the material; however, presenting it to students is very difficult for him since his English is extremely poor. I could understand the words 'enzyme', 'hormone', and 'protein'.  Everything else was very difficult to comprehend. Good luck if you have to take this class because he is the only one teaching it."
240,1040532,1.0,5.0,He should go back to school to learn some English.
241,1802407,5.0,4.0,"Very good professor. Funny and likes to joke around, but is also a good teacher who is clear at explaining things when you ask questions. Super helpful with homework, gives you lots of time to complete it. He generally curves quizzes and tests to help everyone out a little."
242,1802407,4.5,3.0,"Dr Frisch now teaches at UW-Stout, not Mississippi. Overall he is a very good professor who is not overly demanding. He curves quizzes and is there to help, and also he will push back test dates if needed. He appreciates participation, which is hard to come by in a 3xweek 8am lecture. He also is very clear. I would definitely recommend Dr Frisch."
243,1802407,4.0,3.0,The class is hard and not many people like chem but if you need help or have concerns he is always willing to stay after class or meet and talk with you. Attendance isn't necessary but you do get a grade for it. He also drops your lowest test grade if you miss fewer than five classes.
244,1802407,2.5,3.0,It's kind of a hard class but Dr. Frisch gives a practice test for each unit and some of those questions appear on the actual test. The class average is usually never passing so he gives everyone bonus points to bring the test average to a C. He's pretty cool.
245,2367659,1.0,4.0,"A sorry excuse for a professor. He rarely showed up to class. Nothing is graded by him, so your grade will depend on your TA.The tests were fairly difficult, so the TAs were always scrambling to help us learn the information. It is very clear that he does not care about whether you learn the information or not. "
246,2367659,3.0,3.0,"He was a good professor, but he switched things up on the final by making us write two essays and 5 I.D terms. There are a few opportunities for extra credit, not many. Tests/papers are NOT graded by him, so every test is graded by a different scale by the TA's. Not really a good thing unless you have a really nice TA."
247,2711730,5.0,3.0,"If you want a teacher who cares about her students, this is it. Dr. Grant gave out free tutoring, feedback on every assignment, and one-on-one help during class. All of this while still being a mother to a infant and driving over an hour to campus. I can't speak more highly of Dr. Grant."
248,2687155,4.0,5.0,"Analogy: A vessel is pressurized; it explodes; the contents are emptied at random. The tank is the information store that Gentry Berry possesses. The contents are the information. The explosion is equivalent to the information being thrown out all over and at once - the lectures. He, indeed, has more potential than a bulldozer in the stratosphere."
249,2105525,5.0,2.0,I took him for comp 2. He is laid back and cares about students. He grades pretty easy and gives feedback on everything. If you turn in your draft and then fix what he tells you to you should be fine for the final draft. Everyone should get an A in this class if you just turn in the papers. He is also very caring and easy to easy and responds fast.
250,2105525,5.0,3.0,easy grader for essays but no rubrics
251,2105525,5.0,2.0,"I so enjoyed Professor Lammert's class. He promoted productive class discussion and legitimately wanted to hear what we thought about the material. The reading was not too difficult, and I enjoyed all of it. This class was graded by some discussion posts, quizzes, papers, and a final."
252,2105525,4.0,4.0,"Professor Lammert really makes you work to get a good grade. The class is not hard, but be prepared to put in a lot of work to make an A. There is a lenient late work policy. If you're looking for an easy A, this isn't the class. However, Mr. Lammert is a very enjoyable teacher and includes a lot of humor in his notes."
253,2105525,5.0,3.0,"One of the few professors who actually cares about his students and gives feedback, wants you to ask for feedback. Took him for my 2 english courses and can say that he made me a better writer by giving feedback and challenging my thinking. I don't like english or writing but actually enjoyed his course."
254,2105525,5.0,4.0,"This class is difficult, and he is a tough, but fair, grader. He is really quick about answering emails, and he gives a lot of really helpful feedback if you ask for it. He is always willing to work with you and offer his advice. There were only 3 major papers, but lots of small quizzes and activities that help boost your grades if you do the work."
255,2105525,5.0,3.0,Best professor I ever had! Mr. Tom's lectures are very interesting and helpful. I took comp I and comp II with him. I highly recommend him to anyone willing to take comp I and II.
256,2105525,5.0,3.0,Go to class and you'll make an A. Gives great feedback on papers
257,2105525,5.0,3.0,"He is actually a really good teacher! He created a very chill and respectable classroom environment. He will work with you assignments and gives great feed back. You will need EVERY textbook though and mindtap, which isn't his choice. He gives great feed back and tips on papers. Overall 10/10 would take a class under him again."
258,2105525,5.0,1.0,"He is a great prof. He gives you great feedback on your papers and if you have any questions he will make sure you understand it. Make a good connection with him and he will respect you. Go to class, his class is interesting. Lets you out early a lot of the times as long as you are participating and cover the material quickly. Highly recommend!"
259,2105525,4.0,2.0,"Good teacher, but a little bit boring. He's pretty funny though, and he's really helpful with writing papers. You will use every textbook you are required to buy for the class, and you also have to buy MindTap."
260,2105525,3.0,5.0,"He is nice as a person but a very tough grader. I took upper division classes at my last college and received A's I currently am struggling to keep my B. His lectures are kinda dull and lack any emotion, but that being said I can understand it being hard to make freshman comp II fun. Overall wouldn't take him again just do to the tough grading."
261,2105525,5.0,4.0,I loved this class he is so caring and is willing to help you. By far the easiest class i have taken so far
262,2105525,5.0,2.0,"Really cool and laid back. He cares about his students, but he's no pushover. Just do your work and you'll do fine."
263,2785464,5.0,3.0,"Senora Popovic IS THE BEST! She makes Spanish so fun, and is always willing to help. Her attendance is mandatory, and will count off on final letter grade if you miss more than 3 classes. She gives a proper amount of homework, and there are only two exams in the entire course, a midterm and a final. I would take her all over again if I could!!!!!"
264,1122490,2.5,4.0,"if the class starts at 2:00 she is there 2:00 to open the door. She has little understanding for tardiness, and she does not tolerate more than 2 absences, but she misses class because she is sick, because she has to travel, because she has conference, etc. She wants things her way. She is not clear with the assignments she gives."
265,1122490,1.0,4.0,"I've had her for two classes now and have to take her again. You can barely understand her, she laughs at herself constantly, and she grades unfairly... and no I am not saying this because I got a bad grade, I had an A in both classes. Aditionally she is rude to students and her class is a waste of time."
266,1122490,3.5,2.0,Really nice teacher and mildly interesting class. Not hard at all.
267,1269962,2.5,2.0,Pretty easy structure after taking the same exact class in high school.  Had a hard time understanding him the first couple of classes but got the hang of it.  Everything is online so I didn't use the actual textbook that much.  Lets you out of class early which is a bonus.  Also the tests are the really close to the reviews he gives in class.
268,1269962,5.0,3.0,Good teacher. Very neat and detailed. Gives good examples. Makes business cal understandable. Overall a good teacher.
269,2588878,5.0,3.0,So if you look at other reviews its the same. He is very chill and cool
270,2588878,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely adored Dr. Thompson this semester! I will be taking another class of his as soon as I can. Amazing, inclusive professor. Felt very inspired by this class and while the exams seem intimidating, they are relatively easy if you payed attention in class and read the materials necessary. He does give pop quizzes so GO TO CLASS!"
271,2588878,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely loved Dr. Thompson's class! I took Early US History (online), and even though there were a lot of lectures, I enjoyed this class. I am a heavy note-taker so I did spend 10 hours/wk taking thorough notes, but it's not necessary. There are tons of assignments as well, but they are super easy and take only a few minutes. 10/10 experience!"
272,2482385,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Buss was a pleasure to take in my comp 1 and comp 2 class. She was always willing to help and be honest with what you needed to change. She is very patient with questions and will crack a joke with you. Do not get offended by her sarcasm (that means she likes you). She doesn't take excuses, but isn't against second chances. Would take again."
273,2482385,5.0,2.0,"You have in-class work, so you should go to class. She talks a lot, but she gives feedback. I hate writing, but she didn't make it had because most of it is group work."
274,2482385,3.0,3.0,"Mrs. Buss is a cool and pretty laid back teacher. Sometimes she can be a little all over the place, but not bad. Lots of group projects, lesson plans, presentations. She wants class discussion and will stare at you till someone speaks. Shes caught up on recent younger topics, and overall is a fun teacher!"
275,639187,2.5,3.0,Do not take this class at a distance; there is NO help.
276,639187,1.0,3.0,What did he just say&#63; Hard to understand. His examples look like my 2 year old sisters coloring. All he does is read over the power point slides. DONT TAKE SAEBO!
277,639187,1.0,3.0,Looks like Seabo's writing his own reviews ;)  he's bad :( no one could give him a good rating. he mumbles. he isnt clear. just not good
278,639187,3.0,2.0,All the other reviews are just from people that did poorly in his class.  He is not that hard to understand.  He works a good many examples and gives you full review tests that he goes over the day before the test.  He is better than most of the other CHEM teachers.
279,639187,1.0,5.0,"I cannot stand this teacher! He is awful...just do not take him!! Everything I knew how to do was taught to me from my friends!! You can't understand a word he says and he will not help you outside of class. If he is your only teacher option, opt for next semester!!!"
280,639187,1.0,5.0,OMG!!His accent is very hard to understand.I learned absolutely nothing in that class because I always had an headache from trying to understand him. The bulk of what I learned came from my friends who had other teachers.Im sure he is a good teaher IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND him.
281,639187,1.0,4.0,This teacher is one of the worse professors on State's campus. I would highly suggest anyone who wants to pass to take another teacher. He uses powerpoint all class and just talks straight to the projector. The lab is not to bad because i have another teacher. But for lecture I would highly suggest another teacher.
282,639187,2.0,5.0,I can't stand this teacher. It is really hard to pay attention to him. I try and try but he is very boring and all he does is a power point and he just keeps talking without making sure if people are understanding. He pretty much just flies by the notes. Oh and the quizzes I don't even know how they are graded. I hate that class.
283,639187,1.0,5.0,He is hard to understand because he cannot seem to figure out how to get his microphone to work.
284,639187,2.0,4.0,No Comments
285,639187,1.5,3.0,"He's hard to understand and his writing is worse than his speech.  The tests aren't to bad if you understand the material but trying to get it from him is tough.  He did get lost in his own problems a lot and have to start over.  If you can, try and take someone who speaks english."
286,2482388,5.0,1.0,"I took this class half online and half in person. He doesn't focus so much on the content, but he focuses more on situations that may occur as a teacher. He had us act out situations he did not do well as a first time teacher to prepare us for what may happen. I learned a lot and was able to make a high A."
287,2482388,4.0,3.0,The class is graded by your participation in a weekly assignment and assignments related to your observations. Mr. J is hilarious and sassy but also very respected and knowledgable about his subject. He expects nothing but the best from you and will show you some tough love if needed. Don't expect to turn in half effort work and get an A.
288,2482388,5.0,4.0,"Mr. J is hilarious! Very sassy and sarcastic. He taught me a lot about things I actually wanted to know about education. Like the interview process, classroom management, and reviewing the TIAI (how youre graded in student teaching). Love him and would definitely take him again!!"
289,2179293,1.0,5.0,she is the the worst teacher I've ever had. absolutely horrendous. 
290,2179293,2.0,4.0,"If Barton's lectures were an ASMR channel, it would be a smash hit. She reads from the PPT which makes lectures extremely boring and will definitely put you to sleep if you're not energized. Class only depends on 4 tests which is asinine. Failing these exams are not an option. Very nice lady however. Terrible teaching style."
291,2179293,3.0,4.0,lectures are soooooo boring. her tests are kinda hard but if you study youll do alright
292,2179293,3.0,4.0,"Mrs. Barton is a super nice lady but she is just not the best teacher. It's obvious biology comes naturally to her, so it's hard for her to explain &quot;why&quot; to things that just make sense to her. That being said, read the powerpoints and you'll do fine on tests. She gave us almost a whole letter grade of extra credit at the end of the semester."
293,2179293,2.0,4.0,What she taught in lectures were very different to what was on the actual test.
294,2179293,4.0,2.0,Mrs. Barton's class was kind of boring but if you study the powerpoints thoroughly you can pass the tests. Biology 1 was only made up of 4 tests and 2 extra credit assignments but she curves grades and her extra credit is worth alot. She is very understanding  and willing to work with you outside of class.
295,2179293,1.0,5.0,She was so awful. Don't take her even if your degree depends on it.
296,2179293,1.0,4.0,She is awful at teaching. Just reads the slides. Also she will give you a 60 question test over 11 chapters. DO. NOT. TAKE.
297,2179293,5.0,2.0,"If you study the PowerPoints and learning objectives and know them, you will easily pass. It is not a hard class but you have to keep up with studying the material. You can not study the night before and expect an A. Mrs Barton cares and is very nice when you have questions. Don't buy the book, none of her test questions come out of it."
298,2179293,5.0,3.0,"I loved taking Barton, and I would take her for bio 2 if she wasn't leaving. Her lectures are really easy to follow because of how passionate she is about biology. She gives most extra credit at the end of the course, so if your grades are struggling, hold out for that. I would normally study by making a quizlet from the lecture slides. Go to SI!!!"
299,2179293,1.0,5.0,Would not take. Very hard test and lectures consist of her reading off of PowerPoints that can be accessed on canvas.
300,2179293,2.0,5.0,Only exams
301,2179293,1.0,5.0,She is just straight up a rude person. She has no care at all about teaching students.
302,2179293,1.0,5.0,test are your only grades in the class and we have 4 . i dropped
303,2179293,5.0,3.0,"Bio 2 is a heavy course, but professor Barton was a great teacher. She is very compassionate about the subject and is always ready to help her students succeed. She gives extra credit and throws out heavily missed questions on tests. She is one of my favorite Biology professors. You will have to study, but she gives notes that are straightforward."
304,2179293,3.0,5.0,"Professor Barton is a really nice lady and she is very knowledgable about biology, however the class is extremely boring. There are only 4 tests and each test has about 200 slides of information from the lectures. The SI sessions help, but it's still a lot of information crammed into 75 questions."
305,2179293,5.0,4.0,"Biology 2 is a class that covers a lot of material and requires a lot of studying no matter which professor you take. However, Mrs. Barton's tests come straight from the powerpoint, and if you put the effort in to study them, you will do well on the tests. Additionally, if you genuinely enjoy learning about biology, you will love her class."
306,2179293,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Barton scales every test - enough said. She actually cares about you and will open up practice material and extra credit. She also wants to help you find better ways to study. If you hate biology, you will hate the material - it is a biology class, so that shouldn't be what she is rated on IMO. She is a great teacher, and I took her for 1 and 2"
307,2179293,5.0,4.0,"Mrs. Barton was an amazing professor in my opinion! Yes, there was definitely a whole ton of info that was not easy and definitely not interesting. But, this is biology, and it's not her fault that the class and material is difficult and abundant. She truly cares and really wants you to pass, and explains so much in her lectures so you understand."
308,2179293,2.0,5.0,"You have to study insanity hard just to pass. This is the only class Ive ever made a C in. I had two meetings with her about my grade, and she pretty much told me to study more. Shes a really sweet person but the class is boring and hard."
309,2179293,4.0,3.0,"Barton's lectures are very boring because she reads straight from the slides. However, the test are exactly from the notes. If you have really studied the notes and know them you should do fine in her class. Lost of material to study for test though. Gave an option for extra credit project to do throughout the year. Her bio 2 class was the same way"
310,2179293,3.0,5.0,lots of long lectures with a lot of info. we only had 4 tests and our lab counted for 20% of our grade. you have to study a lot for this class
311,2179293,5.0,4.0,"Martha Barton is a real gem, and she cares. It is not her fault that biology is a boring subject and that there is so much to cover. She really tries her best to help you pass and is readily accessible, she talked to my friend about how to study for over an hour. She also throws out bad test questions and will give out extra credit assignments."
312,2179293,4.0,4.0,"Ms. Barton really cares about Biology. There is a lot of information in Bio I, and she covers it all and explains it out. If you find Biology boring, you will be bored by this class. If you find it fascinating, you will see that she is telling a lot of examples and explaining things out to make it easier. Read the book, use office hours. She cares."
313,2179293,5.0,4.0,"I usually don't write reviews, but I feel bad that Ms. Barton's reviews are so harsh. I really enjoyed her class, honestly. She really cared about our grades, and she would try hard to connect the information with her own experience. There is, obviously, a lot of information in Bio 1 and 2 but come to class and listen and you should be good."
314,2179293,2.0,4.0,"Very boring lectures with so much information. I went to every class, but I still struggled to pay attention and learn the information. She posts her powerpoints online. Tests are hard because there is so much information to learn. You have to start studying a week or so in advance to truly learn the information and half the time I just memorized."
315,2179293,1.0,5.0,Barton is literally so bad. She does not care at all if you learn the material and if you do or dont go to class it doesnt really matter. The tests DO NOT reflect the lecture material in the slightest. One of the worst teachers Ive had honestly.
316,2179293,2.0,3.0,"Mrs. Barton is a very sweet lady, but her overall teaching ability is not great. The lab for this class is ridiculous and the TAs are irresponsible. Study way in advance if you want an A. This is a required core class for Biological Science majors. There is a little extra credit given. Best of luck!"
317,2179293,1.0,5.0,She does post the slides for each chapter but even if you know the slides front to back the test are super hard. She does give extra credit if you go to class. You are only graded by four tests and lab average. Probably the hardest class I have ever taken.
318,2179293,1.0,4.0,"worst professor on the planet. Reads straight from ppts that make no sense &amp; will put you to sleep. Half of the info on her tests isn't even on her slides. I studied for 10+ hours, took 20+ pages of notes, and read every single slide (all 250 of them) and made a 73. Didn't know anything on the test. Gave other students diff, easier questions."
319,2179293,3.0,4.0,She was a decent Prof. Nothing too amazing but was not bad either.
320,2179293,5.0,3.0,"She always posts powerpoints of the material and uses personal stories to make lectures more interesting. If you visit her office, she always helps with material but is also willing to help you get involved in undergrad research. The tests are straightforward so it's not hard if you study the powerpoints."
321,2179293,4.0,3.0,Her tests are based on the power points that are made available before class. Essential Study and understand everything on the powerpoints and you'll get an A. She encourages her students to get involved in research and is very kind. She also explains her slides more in-depth so even though it is not mandatory to go to class it is helpful.
322,2179293,1.0,4.0,She is very monotone and uninteresting and expects all the reading to be done before class. The class drags on
323,2179293,1.0,5.0,All she does is sit at the front of the room and read straight off of her slides in a very monotone voice. She doesnt explain anything either. Just study the slides extensively and go to SI and youll pass
324,2179293,4.0,3.0,"Martha Barton is a solid choice for Bio 1. She posts her slides, and she has given extra credit on multiple occasions for just being in class. (Attendance is not mandatory, but in order to receive the extra credit, you do have to go to class). Tests are 75 multiple choice (straight from the slides) and there is a drop test. She wants us to do well."
325,2179293,1.0,4.0,"Trash. Her class sucks and all she does is read off the slides. Her tests are over SO MANY chapters. If you can get a different teacher, please do so. You will regret taking this class"
326,2179293,1.0,5.0,She reads directly from the power points and will put you to sleep. She posts them online but get ready to teach yourself. I learned more in the SI sessions than in class. 4 75 question multiple-choice tests and an optional final. I studied hard and made Cs on all of them. I do not recommend her at all.
327,2179293,3.0,4.0,She is a good teacher but it is A LOT of memorization with odd words that are hard to remember. She can be awkward but I like her a lot and she really cares. Study a week or more in advanced to remember everything and you'll get an A for sure. Lab is short and sweet.
328,2179293,1.0,5.0,This professor reads powerpoints all class. You could honestly skip every class and read the powerpoints yourself. The most helpful resource for me is SI. My TA is great and does a better job of teaching the material than my professor.
329,2179293,5.0,3.0,"I believe she's a good teacher, and yes I think she also cares about her students. The material is not complicated, so here is how you will ensure an A. Go to lab and do well. Speed read her PP's once, deep read 2nd time, review on 3rd time. Disclaimer I made a B since I work full time and have a kid etc..., but hey, i still made a B..."
330,2179293,2.0,4.0,"Mrs. Barton wasn't the worst professor I've ever had, but she definitely wasn't my favorite. I missed class a good bit and still finished with a high B. If you go to class, print the lecture notes, and pay decent attention you'll be fine."
331,2179293,4.0,5.0,"Ms. Barton posts her lecture slides on Canvas before class. Printing those slides and then just highlighting the important info/jotting down notes was super helpful. Even though it may not seem like it, she really does care about her students."
332,2179293,4.0,3.0,Dr. Barton is probably the best choice for Bio 2. Her tests are all multiple choice but there are only 4 tests that decide your final grade (along with your lab grade). If you go to class shell sometimes offer extra credit. However Bio 2 is boring and has lots of material in general so study hard for her class.
333,2179293,1.0,5.0,She wouldn't round my 78.9 to a B and is the reason why I didn't finish the semester with all B's. Be prepared to teach yourself everything because she cannot do her job. How she is still teaching her is a big mystery.
334,2179293,1.0,5.0,She posts the slides but she only reads off the slides in class so youre going to be teaching yourself regardless. Had to do every single study method and study 2 weeks in advance to get a B on the test. She also calls out students if they are even whispering in class.
335,2179293,1.0,4.0,She is extremely boring. Attendance is not mandatory but throughout the semester she offers bonus points for those who come to class so i would recommend going. The tests are word for word from the notes so memorize the slides. It is hard and you do have to work for an A. I recommend copying the notes on paper off the slides posted online. It helps
336,2179293,1.0,3.0,"... umm, well... she is something. The class has potential to be interesting, she just doesnt make it interesting. The reason i did bad in the class is because Im just not good at biology. If you can remember stuff, youre set. I dont know her test making process but if i had to guess, she just reads the slides and makes questions from that."
337,2179293,1.0,5.0,"The hardest class ever. She reads straight off slides without any explanation and post them online. Test are very comprehensive, but I do not recommend her. If you have to take her, go read over your test and use her office hours to your advantage. Get a tutor to explain the material to you."
338,2179293,1.0,5.0,"Im more than positive Martha thinks shes the most important person in the world, and that her class is the most important class ever. She must have hit her big head and forgotten this is a gen. ed., not a junior/senior level class. Pretty sure she purposely failed me on the final exam after asking her to raise my grade about 2 points for an A."
339,2179293,1.0,4.0,Her animal diversity class is long and ridiculous. She reads straight off the slides (extremely boring) and talks very quiet like she's scared of her students. Her tests contain a stupid amount of material and ask questions about things you wouldn't expect like off pictures. And the lab report from he lab is really long and a waste of time.
340,2179293,3.0,4.0,"Mrs. Barton's lectures are very long-winded, and her tests cover an insane amount of material. She is very nice and cares a lot about her students' success, but her class requires lots of hours of studying in order to do well on her tests. It took me forever to figure out how to best study for her class, but once I got the hang of it it was alright"
341,2179293,4.0,4.0,"She does read from the powerpoint, but is good about trying to explain a little more in detail, especially with the pictures. She is easy to access outside of class, and she does help you with study tips if you take the time to go talk to her. She is very sweet, but you have to work for an A in the class and start studying for the tests early."
342,2179293,4.0,3.0,"The 4 tests given are straight off of the slides. She understands that Bio II is a very boring class so she tries not to make it so bad. Although attendance and textbooks are not mandatory, try to attend as much as possible because she gives easy extra credit on days that many people are absent. Shes nice unless youre talking in class."
343,2179293,2.0,4.0,"Do not recommend! She reads straight off lecture slides. low-tone voice. doesn't allow laptops/phones, will call you out. Test are long &amp; hard. Only have four tests, no drop grade, final is your fourth. boring to listen to. Study hard and start weeks prior to the test. Go to SI. Don't skip class, take notes, listen. Does post lecture slides online"
344,2179293,1.0,5.0,Boring lectures and does not explain any of the material. It would be better to teach yourself everything.
345,2179293,5.0,3.0,"I enjoyed Mrs. Barton's class. Her lectures are slightly boring, but she was easy to understand and would answer any questions you have in class. I am taking her again for General Biology II. Her tests are 75 multiple choice, and it is very possible to get an A if you just study. Also, she posts slides and gives extra credit if you attend class."
346,2179293,1.0,4.0,ONLY USES 4 TESTS TO DETERMINE FINAL GRADE!! A very hard class but gives you random assignments where you write down everything in two min. NOT FOR A GRADE. reads directly off of the slides
347,2179293,3.0,2.0,"yes she does read off the slides and yes she can be monotoned. but honestly, how else are you going to teach a ton of material before the tests? SI exists to make the class easier. for those of you that sit through lecture and read over the notes to prepare for the test, then complain about getting bad grades, try actually studying."
348,2179293,3.0,3.0,"Overall she is a decent professor. She just reads off the slides, but she is boring! You can miss class and still be able to understand the lecture material. It's just a lot of material to know. Her tests are directly from the Powerpoint. So making a quizlet or flashcards would be the best way to study for her class."
349,2179293,2.0,4.0,"Prof. Bartons biology 1 class is very hard if you havent taken bio since early high school like myself. During lectures, she reads the slides word for word and doesnt explain much if anything and goes too quickly through the slides to even take notes. I had to learn the material and teach myself all semester. Her only grades are the 4 exams."
350,2179293,5.0,2.0,Her test are all the information off her powerPoint. Pretty easy class
351,2179293,2.0,3.0,Very very boring. Posts the slides online but some of the test material wasn't on the notes. Cannot study the night before. No laptops allowed and will call you out in a 200+ class to tell you to put something away. Reminded me of high school. Go to SI.
352,2179293,3.0,4.0,"Although she is monotone, she is very straightforward with her information. The powerpoints are the test. You do not need a text book. Attendance does not count, but if you go, reread the powerpoint slides, and then attend SI when you do not get the material, you will pass. If you do miss lecture, she posts the powerpoints, so you can catch up."
353,2179293,1.0,4.0,"Her test questions are incredibly long and complicated but they are straight from the slides, which she does post. The textbook will never be used. Quiet speaker, easy to fall asleep."
354,2179293,2.0,4.0,She is decent but is VERY boring. Tests are straight forward if you study. Also go to SI!!!
355,2179293,4.0,3.0,She posts her notes online and if you study those you should be fine. Shes probably the best option for Bio 2 at state.
356,2179293,4.0,4.0,During lecture she just reads directly off the PowerPoint that she gives u access to. If u study the PowerPoint by just reading over them or rewriting a few weeks ahead u will be fine. The SI sessions were pretty helpful too. She is available out of class for office hours& encourages u to come. Lecture is very boring but attendance doesn't count.
357,2179293,3.0,4.0,Her class can be very tough if you are not willing to work for your grade. Showing up to class is not mandatory but not showing up could hurt you in the long run. She is willing to work with people and she does throw out questions on tests that everyone misses.
358,2179293,2.0,4.0,"Go to SI for the Bio 1! Heavy on notes and the tests are 75 questions. Lectures are boring, she reads it word for word. She sometimes gives a pop quiz to check attendance so dont scan and swipe. Go to the Bio lab with the class, it will help with overall grade. Drop grade on lowest score. Take the final if you think youll fail."
359,2179293,1.0,4.0,Shes a nice lady but lectures the entire class. All she does is read off the slides and it gets extremely boring and hard to follow. Her sides are also long like 30-40 a class. Her tests are 70 questions each and the questions themselves are several sentences long. The last test was 16 pages. I wouldn't recommend this teacher.
360,2179293,2.0,3.0,"Pros: she really encourages students to come to her office hours and, curves test.   Cons: she practically reads the power point slides during lectures and it is super easy to fall asleep in them. Your grade rest solely on tests and lab quizzes."
361,2613474,1.0,4.0,"Horrible. If I wasn't required to take her, I wouldn't be here. Condescending, treats you like your a child but then expects you to figure everything out yourself. Does not use Canvas, so write down all verbal assignments/directions."
362,2195701,1.0,3.0,"Pete Smith is an overall not nice human being. He uses profanity heavily in his classes (and yeah, we all do, but time and place, you know?) and thinks hes super cool for it. 4 Quizzes, 4 tests, and graded attendence. Thats it. If you miss one quiz, you wont get an A. If you are really close to an A, he doesn't care. Screams at studentsfornoreason."
363,2195701,2.0,2.0,"The class was EXTREMELY boring. All we did was listen to his lectures and they usually weren't interesting. Sometimes the lectures got really weird (don't know why, it's mass media) and it was a bit awkward if you know what I mean. He could also be really rude and would call you out for having your mask below your nose and stuff like that."
364,2195701,2.0,2.0,possibly the most boring prof at msu; he puts me to sleep in class. he also loves unnecessarily long essay questions and throwing questions on the final exam that never showed up before hand in the class you were taking. sometimes he's really rude as well but at least most of his classes are easy A's.
365,2195701,5.0,1.0,Easy laid back professor. Dont use your phone in class bc he gets mad. Tests are easy. No homework. Just tests and quizzes on Canvas.
366,2195701,3.0,2.0,"Mass Media is easy, idk what else he teaches. Lectures a lot which can be boring because he can be very monotone, but he also shows interesting documentaries. Attendance is taken for a grade, and test questions and answers are reflected in the notes, so go to class. As long as you show up, take notes, and pass quizzes and tests, you'll pass."
367,2195701,3.0,4.0,"DONT cheat in his class or even attempt to. he takes the honor code to an extreme. a couple kids in my class automatically failed his class for cheating. honestly, his test aren't tough, theres just a lot of reading. o"
368,811261,3.5,3.0,"Very passionate, and is a moderately nice person. He makes the class interesting and has a nice vibe. Not a big fan of the pop quizzes, which determine a major part of your grade. Which will make you regret prepping for your other classes. Still a nice professor overall."
369,811261,3.5,4.0,If your looking for an easy A dont take this class. he gives stupid pop quizes that brought my grade down other than that i enjoyed the class and making flower arrangements.
370,811261,5.0,3.0,"He's very passionate about what he does, vry friendly and fun to listen to.  The class is very involved, but he makes it extremely fun.  Pop quizes.  I'd definitely recommend him."
371,811261,5.0,1.0,Awesome teacher!  Not really an easy class but he made it easy because of his love of teaching.  Very helpful and holds your interest.  Passionate about what he does.  Great class.  Recommend this class to everyone.
372,2736394,4.0,1.0,"Dr. Adams is great, whereas he does give out a fair amount of homework and excel tests, they are not too difficult. Everything is very organized but make sure to check canvas everyday to see when things are due because some assignments have short time slots of when they need to be completed. He cares about his students, and is very accessible. "
373,2736394,5.0,3.0,"I loved taking a class with Mr. Adams. He was so nice and wanted us to understand the material! I would try to go to class because of pop quizzes, but he did not take attendance on the scanners. He truly does care about his students and knows his material! He also has great advice and has many connections!"
374,2736394,4.0,2.0,"Tests are kind of difficult but they were online and there was always a study guide. His class is lecture heavy, but the notes are posted and are pretty much the same as the textbook. Final is optional and there are several dropped quizzes and home works. There are in class quizzes, but you can access them online and take them during time. "
375,2736394,3.0,3.0,"I took him for international logistics, and it was okay. The excel tests can be challenging, but other than that there isnt much homework. Reading the book will help lots, but theres only two tests"
376,2203918,5.0,3.0,Definitely lays out how to write the paper which is very helpful. Easy to get an A if you go to class and do the assignments competently. Only complaint is she takes a bit to grade the papers which is kind frustrating because I don't know what to fix on my next paper.
377,2203918,5.0,3.0,"I had her for Comp I and Comp II and I would honestly say she is my favorite teacher. She is nice, approachable, and hilarious, and she makes an effort to get to know her students. She makes complex topics seem easy and walks you through the steps of writing a decent paper. She is accessible outside of class and is willing to answer any questions."
378,2203918,5.0,1.0,Ive taken her twice for Comp I &amp; II and I wish I could take her for every other class I have. You really only need the Freshman Comp workbook and the online code because no other book is ever used. She's really laid back and understanding if you didn't finish your work on time. Definitely take her if you can.
379,2203918,4.0,3.0,She does not put grades in until the end of the semester but she is a great teacher who really works with her students.
380,2203918,3.0,4.0,"Did not put a single grade up the whole semester, went into finals having no idea what I had, grade wise. Really sarcastic. Class is required."
381,139535,4.5,3.0,"Excellent presentations, very helpful when one doesn't understand material, encourages discussion in class."
382,139535,4.0,4.0,Had a true passion and knowledge for the subject she teaches. Very opinionated and sometimes difficult to keep up with. But a very helpful teacher and truly there to help the students learn. Get to know her and put forth the effort.
383,139535,4.5,4.0,No Comments
384,139535,3.0,4.0,No Comments
385,139535,5.0,4.0,"You do really have to work in her classes, but she knows her stuff and is always eager to help.  Come to class, pay attention, and put in the proper effort and you should do well in any of her classes."
386,139535,2.0,5.0,I thought that the reports that were required for class are little on the exteme
387,2203920,5.0,3.0,"Professor Smith is extremely helpful. Even though the test is the same for all business cal classes, he prepares you really well. He is extremely caring and will answer any question in such a nice way. The tests are multiple choice. I would 10/10 recommend him if he's an instructor for any math class you need."
388,2203920,5.0,3.0,"He really cares about his students and if they understand the material. Before a test, I emailed him a question I didn't know how to do and he did the problem 3 different ways and sent it to me. His lectures are easy to understand and the homework load is not bad!"
389,2203920,5.0,1.0,"He's the best teacher at State! He literally takes his time with you, if you don't understand something he goes in depth on it. He's literally the best I wish I could take his class for every math I would have to take. You have to make good grades on homework to be able to get extra credit at the end of the semester."
390,2203920,5.0,4.0,"Super consistent as far as grading/assignments and office hours! He's willing to answer any question you have and will help you with homework outside of class. Very thorough during lectures, even if he goes a little fast. I suck at math, but I got my C and am moving on with life."
391,2203920,5.0,3.0,He's one of the best at State.
392,2203920,5.0,2.0,Smith is my favorite math teacher I've ever had. If you aren't that great at math he explains everything in detail for you. Only 4 tests plus the final but super easy.
393,2203920,5.0,2.0,He explains the material very well. He encourages questions. Very nice and funny. All trig students take the same tests so it doesnt really matter what teacher you have. Mr Smith will have you prepared
394,2203920,5.0,2.0,"He is an amazing teacher, I had him for College Algebra and Trig. He will help if you need. If you don't understand do not be afraid to say something. Mr. Smith will HELP IF YOU ASK HIM."
395,2203920,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Smith made trig just about as enjoyable as possible. He followed the problems in the workbook exactly, so I recommend getting that. The homework and quizzes are online and the tests are just like the homework. If you don't understand, he is more than willing to help and he never makes you feel like your question is stupid."
396,2203924,5.0,4.0,Dr. Larson is very knowledgable and knows how to relay that knowledge in a way that makes class interesting and enjoyable. She cares a lot about the subjects she teaches and truly wants her students to understand as well. Paying attention in her class is a must but her love for the subject makes lectures interesting and fun to pay attention to.
397,2203924,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Larson in my opinion acts like she cares but in reality, she makes aspects of her class (not academics) hard for no reason. She gave us what would be an EASY assignment, but her instructions were so contradictory and confusing that almost every other person I spoke with got completely different answers than each other. Not a chill professor."
398,2203924,5.0,3.0,Dr. Larson is an amazing ADS professor. She posts the outline to her lectures but will add in extra tidbits that you'll need to know for the exams. There are a few projects throughout the semester that she uses to help you learn the material. She is accessible outside of class and is more than willing to help.
399,2203924,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Larson really is one of those professors that care. Toward the end of the semester, she gives opportunities to bring your grade up since the first half of the class is super hard. She always responded to my emails and she's actually pretty funny."
400,2203924,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Larson was a great professor. She made the lectures interesting, and the class was enjoyable. Attendance is graded."
401,2203924,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Larson is the best! Shes makes class very interesting and explains things very well. With all that being said, you have to read the book and study the material to pass. Tests are based on many chapters which can make them difficult."
402,2203924,5.0,4.0,"Dr Larson made my Animal Science class a lot of fun. You do have to read the book and study the notes, it is a lot, but the tests are not too hard if you study well. Don't expect to show up and get an A on the test without any studying. For someone who did not grow up around cattle or poultry, she explains everything very well."
403,2203924,5.0,4.0,"Dr Larson is the best! She takes effort to give metaphors to help you understand concepts. Lots of info in lectures, and exams cover many chapters. Be ready to study! She explains concepts well and is willing to go over exams and further explain and answer questions. Attendance matters!"
404,2203924,5.0,4.0,I love Dr. Larson!!! She made the class so entertaining and is passionate about what she teaches. She will most definitely help you if you ask for help because she wants you to succeed! I personally didn't use the book much except on review questions about the chapter at the end of her PowerPoint slides. I will definitely be seeing her for repro!
405,2203924,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Larson is an amazing professor and is clearly passionate about animal science. However, with that being said, you do have to put a lot of studying in to get a good grade in this class. She gives out a few extra credit points here and there so try not to skip class!"
406,2203924,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Larson is an amazing teacher who cares about the success of her students. She wants you to LEARN, so she will expect you to do a lot of studying outside of class, but her lectures are great! She gives you many grade boosters, besides exams and quizzes, and she expects you to SHOW UP TO CLASS! She loves to give random bonus points for coming."
407,2203924,5.0,3.0,"There's definitely a lot of information to cover, so studying is a must. Dr. Larson elaborates a lot on her power points, so going to class is definitely going to help you a lot. She really does want you to pass and her tests reflect what she teaches in class. She tells you specifically what will and will not be on the test. She also makes jokes!"
408,2203924,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Larson is the BEST! She does such a great job at explaining everything and always asks for peoples questions! Also gives lots of assignments to balance out exam grades. Her tests are straight from her lectures, so make sure you study! You can tell she cares a lot about her students as well."
409,2203924,5.0,4.0,"I loved Animal Science Fall 2020, even with the Covid-19 updates. I showed up to every in-person class and passed easily. Those who either only showed up to the WebEx meetings or not at all had a much harder time. The weekly quizzes are not my favorite content-wise, but they help a bit. The test are straight from the lectures and very specific."
410,2203924,2.0,3.0,This semester has been hybrid. Her lectures are her reading straight off of the powerpoints and her exams only have about 1/2 of the lecture material on them. the other half is one-off facts from the textbook that were only mentioned once and no importance was even placed on that fact. Extremely difficult to study. She doesn't know how to use webex
411,2203924,5.0,4.0,Very informative about what shes teaching and has amazing lectures though she does condense her exams into long versions of every chapter she gives a layout of what is gonna be taught that day.
412,2203924,5.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed Larson's class this semester. She tells exciting and interesting lectures, and she is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. The tests require a bit of study, but the questions are very straightforward and nothing too terrible. I learned a lot from her and 100% recommend her."
413,2203924,4.0,4.0,Really enjoyed her. She works with you well if you need to miss class. Had to miss a lot the semester I had her but was very easy to work with.
414,2203924,4.0,3.0,"She really knows her stuff. If you study her lecture outlines and go to class, you'll do fine! She also gives points for attendance, which help boost your class grade. There are daily quizzes, but the answers are pretty much straight from her outlines."
415,2203924,5.0,4.0,I love Dr. Larson! She is amazing! She makes you work for your grade though! Some of her test can be tough. If you actually study throughout the semester and not wait until the day before the test to study there is no reason you cant get a A in her class.
416,2203924,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Larson is a great professor. She is very knowledgeable in the subject matter she teaches and makes the lectures very interesting. She takes the time from day 1 to learn everyones name, which is very challenging in a lecture of 150+ students. This class involves a lot of reading/studying but still one of my favorite by far! Would take again"
417,2203924,4.0,4.0,"Larson is a good professor; you can tell she is very passionate about ADS. However, her tests are very extensive and you have to put in a lot of hours if you want an A. Overall, she is worth taking."
418,2203924,5.0,3.0,She is super sweet! This was my favorite class! Larson is heavy on test material but she makes class super fun! She likes to imitate the animals to help her students better understand the material. Defiantly made lecture more fun! I highly recommend her! I didnt use the book at all. Dont waste your money! Study in advance and u will pass!
419,2203924,4.0,4.0,"Is weirdly stern the 1st day of class trying to weed-out non Ag students, but is really nice! Grades: 4 exams (cover many chapters), video speech, participation/attendance, and the final exam. Study for the exams, most people do not prepare enough and struggle the rest of the semester. Slides straight from the book, read to help clarify/study."
420,2203924,5.0,4.0,Good
421,2203924,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Larson did a good job explaining everything, but she has a LOT of material in her lectures between tests. I made a quizlet for all terms and any kind of set numbers (like # gestation days per type of animal) and that helped me a lot. She has some paragraph/essay questions on her tests but if you go to class and pay attention you'll be fine."
422,2203924,5.0,4.0,"Very knowledgeable about the course, especially reproduction. She is rather stern and makes students earn their grade but is very fair but cares and wants students to succeed. I learned a tremendous amount from this class."
423,2203924,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Larson's lectures come straight from the textbook (which you'll definitely need). She goes fast in lectures, so if you're the type that has to write down every word, you might like to take notes on a laptop. The tests cover a large amount of material, so be ready to put in some study time. Be ready for essay questions, especially on the final."
424,2203924,2.0,4.0,"Considering it was her first year teaching Animal Science, Dr. Larson did the best she could with the little knowledge she had. Saying that, her lectures were straight from the book. BUT each exam (only 4 including the final) contained information from at least 10 CHAPTERS. And she is very unhelpful outside of class. My only C and I'm an A student."
425,2203924,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Larson was the teacher you want to hate but can't. The course material is heavy but she is willing to answer any questions you may have. The textbook is basically mandatory because she lectures straight from it. This isn't necessarily bad though because it makes her easy to follow. Tests are fair but difficult. StuDYING is a must, no skimping."
426,1212695,5.0,4.0,"Mingzhou Jin is one of the best professors I have ever taken.  I took his IE 6733 Linear Programing Course in 2009 and found that his lectures were extremely precise, I really enjoyed it. -Herbe Chun"
427,2736415,5.0,1.0,Loved this professor! Would take again! Got a 100 in his class! and it ended early.
428,2736415,5.0,2.0,Take him frfr! He really cared about his work and his students and he knew none of us were going to law school. Attendance isnt required and tests were open note and open book. And he copied the questions from the book. Easy and pretty interesting to listen too.
429,2736415,5.0,3.0,"He's very into his job and gives great lectures. You are strictly graded on exams so no extra assignments to help cushion your grade. But at the end of the semester, he gives two extra credit quizzes. Don't forget to do the participation quiz in the first week. I forgot when it was due which is why I ended with a C. "
430,2736415,5.0,2.0,"His lectures are good because he gives lots of case examples and to me, he is funny. Attendance is not mandatory, but I would go to class because a lot of times he gave notes on cases that aren't in the outline. The notes you take yourself on those cases will help on the test (which are open book/ open note)."
431,2736415,5.0,2.0,"I would definitely recommend taking this class. The tests are given online through Honorlock, but you are able to use your notes and the book. He normally cancels class about a week before the test, so you are given plenty of time to take it. He basically lectures the entire class and gives out outlines to follow along with his PowerPoints. "
432,2736415,5.0,1.0,The sweetest professor ever. He really wants you to succeed and understand the material. The textbook is online via connect as well as the tests (canvas). The tests are always almost open note meaning you can use the text book and physical notes taken in class and the tests are always in your favor. Outlines for each chapter are provided.
433,2736415,5.0,2.0,Marlin Stewart is an awesome professor. He wants everyone to do well in his class so he makes it easy to have a good grade. The tests are open book and open note. There is also lots of extra credit available. He's very kind and answers emails quickly. I would 100% take this class again.
434,2736415,5.0,2.0,His class was not hard he gives you the notes for each chapter as well as the power point slides. The tests are all online they are proctored however it is open note and open book. I would recommend buying the book it is very helpful on the tests. There are no other grades besides the tests but all the questions can be found in the book. 
435,2736415,3.0,4.0,"He talks very fast, but he posts the notes online. The tests are okay as long as you study for them."
436,2736415,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Stewart was a very down-to-earth guy. He let us use our outline notes on tests which helped with some questions! I felt like I needed to read the textbook to prepare for some tests but not all of them. About halfway through the semester, I started to get the hang of his class, and then it was a breeze! Would recommend."
437,2736415,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Marlin (Marc) Stewart is the best choice for business law. He lets you out around 30 minutes early every lecture. He makes outlines for lectures and you can use them on the tests. We did not have class on test weeks, and sometimes on random days as well."
438,1040673,1.0,4.0,"There is always that one professor that exists solely to stand as an obstacle in your path to success, and Renee Clary is that person. While putting way too much emphasis and grading weight on class discuss boards that provide literally no educational value, she also hyper-fixates on the smallest and most unreasonable of details on class projects."
439,1040673,1.0,5.0,She is rude and picks and chooses which university policies she wants to follow.
440,1040673,2.0,4.0,I should have listened to the warnings. - Grades harshly and deducts unreasonable amount of points not stated clearly. (-20 pts for late and -5 for not stating the Honor Code; I found out the hard way) - Not as clear expectations - Misaligned content in lectures to quiz questions - Only class I've taken that is causing me to be at risk of D
441,1040673,1.0,4.0,"Genuinely the worst GEO professor I have had. Lectures and communication are fine. Tests are rote and she doesn't let you see your scores. Though I finished with an A, assignment directions and feedback (minimal) was baffling. Unless you can read her mind, you will lose points. If you ask for follow-up, well... good luck. Avoid if you can."
442,1040673,5.0,3.0,"Guess what? Her classes are graduate level! Yes, you have to think and you have to do work. Dr. Clary is a great lecturer and offers students multiple opportunities to learn content. She expects you to think like a graduate student and makes you work to earn your grade. If you don't want to work or expect an easy A, then no she isn't for you."
443,1040673,1.0,5.0,"Avoid this instructor at all costs! The class is double the amount of work of a regular 3 unit class. Her grading is downright unfair. She takes off points for things that are not in the syllabus/rubrics. Twelve days before the end of the semester, she added a new course requirement. Her lectures have blatant errors in them. Stay away!!!"
444,1040673,1.0,5.0,I will never ever take a class with Dr. Clary. And neither should you. I looked forward to her class because of the content - but she ruined it and took out all the fun. The directions she gives on assignments are vague and then marks significant points off when you don't read her mind and do exactly what she had in mind.
445,1040673,1.0,3.0,"If you don't need to, do not take a class with Dr. Clary. Many of her test/quiz questions &amp; project outlines are extremely ambiguous/vague &amp; it is at times impossible to discern what she wants. This is complicated when coupled with her very tough grading. It's not simply that she is a 'tough' teacher, rather, her grading is capricious. Lots of work"
446,1040673,5.0,4.0,"Have been her student in about three courses and my grades have not been very good. I know that students are just complaining about how hard it is to take a class with her, not considering she is one of the finest teachers. She works really hard to leverage students' achievement by giving them challenging assignments, quizzes, and w/ good teaching."
447,1040673,4.0,4.0,"I was a distance education student and everything was done online. Yes, it is a lot of work, but it is very convenient to take classes this way. The professor was helpful through emails and responded quickly if I had a question or an issue with the online system."
448,1040673,1.0,5.0,"Well.... not going to lie, she's the hardest teacher i've ever taken a class with. Way too much stuff do complete"
449,1040673,2.0,4.0,"She makes the class way harder than it needs to be. I took Earth Survery 1 and passed it with a breeze. This class is grad school level compared to the first version of the course. She even does hour video lectures for the online course and doesn't give you all the answers you need, you'll have to buy the book/"
450,1040673,4.0,5.0,Paleo of Dinosaurs is hard!  Just ask her and email if you need help!  She wants to help and is very supportive of students.
451,1040673,1.0,3.0,Dr. Clary is a fine lecturer.  Her videos were clear and easy to understand.  But....her quiz questions and exam questions are just strange.  Plan on spending a lot of time writing in this class. You must scan and turn in your homework! No HW exam is a + in my book.
452,1040673,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Clary is a hard teacher, but I learned a lot in her class.  She expects a lot out of her students, but when it's over--you know way more about the subject material! I thought her class was great!"
453,1040673,1.0,3.0,"not helpful or understanding of online education or being an educator in general,  should stick to research and leave educations to those better understanding of it's personal complexities."
454,1040673,2.0,4.0,Terrible.  Quizzes and tests were ridiculous.  Always trying to intentionally make you mess up.  Not good.
455,1040673,1.5,5.0,"Dr. Clary does not explain her assignments well, her test questions are invalid - meaning that they are based off little mundane facts that are not important. not approachable, definitely a detriment to MSU."
456,1040673,2.0,4.0,"For a teacher of teachers, her questions were horrible and always questioned students' competence.  I had seven occasions in which I challenged her questions' wording and the answers she deemed correct.  Only twice did she correct her errors,and then did so without notifying class. Even supporting evidence from my old profs was not considered."
457,1040673,4.0,4.0,"She administered my class online which in her defense can easily lead to misunderstanding. It was one of the best classes I've taken as far as learning. However, I felt test questions were often misleading."
458,1040673,3.5,3.0,She is good for the most part.  My only complaint is that she words a lot of questions strangely on quizzes and such.  Get a lot of clarification before you try to answer them or you may find out that what you thought was asking was not at all what she was thinking when she wrote it.
459,1270103,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Hui was one of my favorite professors. Her class was fun and completely different from the other history classes. Also, she grades pretty easy."
460,1270103,5.0,3.0,I took her for an easy history class Last year and made an A. I have since visited Dr. Hui several times and enjoy the feedback she gives and the help she desires to give. Very knowledgeable and genuinely wants to help. Will be taking her again next semester
461,1270103,2.0,4.0,"Nice lady, but her class is terrible. Her tests are open note, but it always seems that I never have what I need to answer the questions. This is probably because her lectures are extremely hard to follow. She often takes too long explaining things and doesn't get through all the material. ALWAYS tries to continue the lecture when class is over."
462,1270103,4.0,3.0,A good professor who makes class interesting. Friendly and funny. This class had three open-note tests. For two of the tests she gave us the option to write a paper instead and I did this and received an A on both. The tests were difficult despite being open-note. Regular writing exercises and quizzes that there were readings to be prepared for.
463,1270103,5.0,3.0,Very nice professor and very helpful. She tends to be a little long winded but it's not bad. She's funny and very interesting. She's extremely sweet and she's also pretty beautiful! She's not too hard but you definitely have to study. I really enjoyed her classes.
464,336234,1.0,5.0,He is too smart for his own good. Nothing he says makes any sense at all. No matter how hard you study for a test it is impossible to make an A. There is tons of homework and none of it helps with the tests. I have had multiple tutors and study groups and still cannot pass a test. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!
465,336234,1.0,5.0,This teacher is just plain BAD!The overall class average stays around the 50 mark... there are 60 people in the class and the majority are failing... His tests are hard and most of the assignments given leading up to the test do not apply to the test.
466,336234,1.0,5.0,"I got an A. By the skin of my teeth. And this is Intro to Sociology. I shouldn't have had to struggle for an A in this class, considering i finished with an A in cal I and II, chem I and II, bio I, cell bio, etc. Way more difficult and time-consuming than necessary."
467,336234,2.0,5.0,He was very hard and was not very helpful with the assignments.  Test were very hard and he does not give study guides.  Assignments are not easy and most are unimportant for future use.
468,336234,2.0,5.0,He admitted to my class hat his course was the haredest Intro to Sociology course on campus. Showing up everyday for class didn't help; people were still lost. I don't recommend this professor. Freshmans do not need to take this man.
469,336234,2.0,5.0,He needs to contribute more lecture to class.
470,336234,1.0,5.0,Doesnt help you...very bad indeed
471,336234,1.5,5.0,His tests include a lot of information not given during the class and often include confusing wording of questions.

478,336234,4.5,2.0,No Comments
479,336235,5.0,3.0,He was wonderful! I wish I could replace Dr. Devlin with him!! 
480,336235,5.0,3.0,The best teacher I have ever had 
481,336235,5.0,4.0,"He is the best special education teacher you will ever have. He challenges his students and his class requires work and time. However, I have learned more in his classes then any other class. He cares about his students but more importantly he cares about your future students and the teachers you will become. He will help you become the best."
482,336235,5.0,3.0,"I also took EDX 4123 with Dr. Coffey. He's a great teacher. He is a little intimidating at first, but he grows on you and you realize not to take it personal. I definitely felt like I learned a lot from his class. He's the best teacher I've ever met!"
483,336235,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Coffey is Amazing!!! He is a little intimdating at first, but as the semester goes on, the relationship gets lighter and so does the work load!! I would recommend everyone take him!He cares about his students but he cares about the kids in the school system so much more! I am honored to be taught by such a compasionate and experinced proffesor!"
484,336235,5.0,3.0,Had him for several classes. He is a tiny bit intimidating at first but a GREAT teacher...really knows his stuff.
485,336235,5.0,2.0,Doctor Coffey is a great teacher!  He is such a NICE guy- he will go out of his way to help you out.  Also tells good stories to make class interesting...Would take him again!
486,1614192,5.0,1.0,Wonderful teaching skills. Very enthusiastic. Great sense of humor.
487,2752881,4.0,2.0,He really wants you to succeed and makes sure that you understand what he is teaching through his labs. The lab tests are merely labeling insects that he personally places out in previous labs. He is quiet and easy going but very easy to get along with.
488,2621814,5.0,1.0,"Wagner makes physics as easy as it can possibly be. He uses a chalkboard for his lectures, which makes it easy to keep up. This allows students to actually listen to his lectures, rather than struggling to keep up with a slide show. You can also tell that he cares about his students, and he always shows up to class in a good mood. Highly recommend."
489,2621814,5.0,4.0,"I would give a 4, but for OUR Physics department, he's a godsend. I am not the best at physics, but I managed to scrape by just barely with an A, all because of his exceptional lectures. Many points can be lost by trick multiple choice questions, and homework does take a while, but please take him. He is the best the university has for Physics I."
490,2621814,5.0,2.0,"Wagner is the best professor in physics at Mississippi State. He can be awkward at times, but teaches very well. Available to help during office ours and explains information well. He gives example tests to study with example multiple choice. "
491,2621814,4.0,2.0,"Pretty good professor overall. Let's you write your own formula sheet to use on each test, which is a huge plus. I took him for general physics (not calc based), and I'd definitely say he's one of the better options."
492,2621814,5.0,3.0,"Wagner is the GO TO for any physics class. He has a great way of relating difficult concepts to nice analogies for students to understand. His lectures are planned out well in advance and is easy to follow. Practice practice practice the HW questions and conceptual reviews, and go to SI sessions for exam review nights and you will make an A."
493,2621814,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Wagner is a great physics professor. He takes the time to explain things well. The class is super homework heavy, but he will answer any questions you have on the homework. The class is more on the harder side, but he makes it easier to understand. Definitely a great choice for Physics 1."
494,2621814,5.0,5.0,"I would give him 4.5, but some people will give him a low ranking because physics 2 is hard, and so I gave a 5 star. Probably the best physics 2 professor we have."
495,2621814,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Wagner is a pretty good professor. He speaks at a good pace and doesnt rush through anything. He makes sure to leave room for questions. They offer SI for this course and he has office hours. I would highly advise using your resources. If you havent taken Physics in high school or you think its gonna be hard, get help!! Physics is no joke."
496,1393020,5.0,2.0,"She's truly passionate and it made me like the class. No laptops allowed, you have to go to class. She gives you enough time to write what's on the slides. Homework are a bit hard but make a study group! Tests are fair. I'd take this class again, she's amazing."
497,1393020,1.0,4.0,"Class is tiring to be in. No notes on laptops, which would be fine save for the amount of material in each class. If even a few people use their phones in class, she'll tell everyone to go home. Legit. Homeworks are tedious and time consuming. She expects us to care about this class as much as she does, even though it's an intro course. 1 star"
498,1393020,4.0,3.0,"Her lectures are amazing. She is so passionate and pretty approachable. Assignments and tests are fair, if you show up and take notes you'll be fine(she doesn't upload slides). Readings are overall easy but you have to read them before the class. Definitely would like to take her class again."
499,1393020,4.5,2.0,"Professor Brauner-Otto can come across sometimes as a tough cookie, because she's whip-smart and expects that her students work hard. But she's one of the kindest profs at McGill, always ready to help or to discuss with you, and truly wants to help undergrads learn. Plus she's new to being a prof, so she's still got the spark left. She's awesome!"
500,1393020,3.0,3.0,Material is interesting but gets boring halfway through. Prof. is so nice and helpful. Exams are brutal but get really curved up so definitely easy to get a good grade.
501,1393020,4.5,3.0,Teacher is clear and very oper to feedback. Her classes are structured and interactive. In a class of 150people she's pretty close to knowing who's who so show up to class and do your readings you should not be strugling too much. (also there are a few equations in her cours so math haters keep out)
502,1393020,4.5,3.0,Very passionate and engaging prof. She is always available for clarification and wants her students to well. Would definitely take another class with her. You need to go to class and stay on top of readings if you want to do well.
503,1393020,5.0,3.0,She is such a nice teacher and I enjoyed her class a lot
504,1393020,5.0,3.0,"She's an awesome professor, she's interesting and funny. There's a lot of readings however mid term when the class complained she even reduced the readings."
505,1147279,1.5,5.0,"His daily online exams,midterm, and final exam did not reflect the material he taught in class."
506,2769306,5.0,3.0,All around best professor that I have had and will ever have. A good guy that wants you to have success in your life. 
507,2769306,5.0,3.0,Best professor I have ever had. I would recommend him.
508,2769306,5.0,2.0,"the best professor I have ever had. His lectures were so interesting and he rarely just sat there and lectured us. it is very easy content, but Vitaliy makes it very fun. Attendance is graded but only as extra credit. There are also in class ""polls"" that are graded for extra credit. 3 tests and a cumulative final, but there is a dropped test. "
509,2032029,4.0,4.0,"Fifty questions in fifty minutes. Three  exams during the semester and Do NOT be late with assignments, or you will get a zero. My advice is to get a planner. Once you get used to her, she has a pattern. Blogs must be very long and detailed. DB are interesting. Good communication! Would take her again, although expected a better grade."
510,2032029,4.0,4.0,"You have to purchase the online book, because you do weekly questions and answers in it. You have a weekly discussion board and a blog. Watch your due dates(they sneak up on you). Overall, she was pretty good! I had a technical difficulty one evening with our first exam, and she gave me the chance to do it over. Interesting discussion boards."
511,729507,4.0,3.0,"He did go through the lecture fast often, but not a very difficult class if you review the notes. GET READY TO WRITE! If youre going to be on your phone/electronic, dont sit in the front. A lot of pages of notes for every exam, but study as you go and you will be fine4 - 75q m/c exams and a lab grade"
512,729507,4.0,4.0,"Study as soon as class ends. His tests aren't as hard as people say as long as you review your notes regularly. SI gives practice tests and quizlets, so take advantage of those. His lectures are solely content-focused, so they can feel tedious at times. If you zone out it's okay, just make sure to get the notes somehow because he doesn't post them."
513,729507,4.0,2.0,"I don't understand why Holder has so many bad reviews. His tests are straight from the notes. If you study and know your notes, you will make an A easily. Yes, he is boring to listen to during the lectures and you do have to show up to class because he doesn't put any notes on canvas. I would take his class again. "
514,729507,3.0,4.0,"Bio 2 is hard in general, but his lectures were him reading straight from the slides. He never responds to emails so don't even try. His test are hard and very detailed. You have to work your butt off in this class. Do not take if hoping for an easy A. Lots of outside class studying."
515,729507,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Holder has an undeserved reputation as a tough teacher; he always lays out his expectations for the course, and unfortunately many students do not listen. Attend class, take plenty of notes, pay attention, and you should do just fine. Prepare to write out several pages on the exams, as he expects you to be intimately familiar with the material."
516,729507,4.0,5.0,"Hes a very straightforward professor. His notes come straight from the powerpoint and he expects you to take notes by hand as there is a strict no technology rule. If you actually study the notes and become familiar with them, you will do well on the tests!"
517,729507,3.0,5.0,"Nice man, but his lecture slides are not well organized so its kind to retain the info well. Only grades are his 4 tests plus the lab grade which counts as a test grade. He has a strict no technology policy, and will call you out for trying to take pics of his slides. He also goes very fast."
518,729507,2.0,5.0,"He doesn't post his notes online, just the figures he goes over in class with no notes. So attendance is not mandatory, but it is if you want to get the notes. Your only grades are tests and they focus only on certain topics but he doesn't tell you which ones. tests are hard. I had to drop the class. "
519,729507,4.0,3.0,I enjoyed this class and all the material. He is not a bad professor just make sure to take notes in class. The exams come straight from the notes and are usually not too bad. Go to the SI sessions they really help and they provide practice exams that are similar to the actual exams. You don't need the textbook at all.
520,729507,1.0,4.0,Not my favorite class. Just very bland and seems like he doesnt really want to be there at all
521,729507,1.0,5.0,"Never answers emails, refuses to put lectures online, wouldn't post the syllabus for the first two weeks of class, moves too fast through lectures, no technology policy, I could keep going. This was a terrible class. I went to the SI sessions, studied for a week for each test and still failed the class. Take a different teacher if you can."
522,729507,1.0,5.0,"NO ELECTRONICS. No videoing lectures. No taking pictures of PowerPoint. Or you will get quicked out of class (or so he has said). If you write slow and miss the notes, then you are out of luck. Does not put the lecture online. The only grades are the 4 hard test given. NEVER responds to emails. VERY confusing teacher. GO. TO. SI. SESSIONS!!!"
523,729507,1.0,3.0,"Professor holder is one of the most bitter, uninspired, unprofessional professors Ive ever had. He comes to class in a bad mood, unenthusiastic about what he is teaching. He refuses to catch up with the times and implement technology in his teaching. Doesnt use canvas or email. When a student has a question he gives condescending responses."
524,729507,5.0,3.0,"BIO 2 covers material on taxonomy of animals, plants, human anatomy &amp; physiology, etc. While I took this class online, it was a breeze! I recommend not getting the textbook, I never bought it and did great. Dr. Holder does a great job at explaining the content and talks at a nice pace. Your grade is based solely on 4 exams."
525,729507,3.0,4.0,This class was pretty boring because Prof. Holder basically just read off of the PowerPoints. The exams were fairly difficult but manageable if you take good notes from the PowerPoints. I would recommend the SI class because you can get more applicable scenarios from the TAs when it comes to exam material.
526,729507,2.0,4.0,"Just reads off the powerpoints, gives so much information and tests on the most obscure things. Lots of note taking and studying required, and he is very boring. Test 2 is the hardest. Took the lab online too and it was a free 100. Only grades are 4 tests and the lab, which is equal to one test."
527,729507,2.0,5.0,The class is heavy on content so there's tons of lecture videos to watch. The test has a lot of questions that are worded oddly too.
528,729507,4.0,4.0,"Overall, I would say he is a good professor. His tests are difficult, but they are straight from his lectures and he doesnt ask questions on anything he doesnt mention in his notes. This being said, you really have to put time in studying to make good test grades. If you study well, youll do fine!!"
529,729507,1.0,5.0,This man is horrible for teaching. I had to take him online however I talked to many people that had him in person and they agree with me that this man is the worst teacher. Never take this man. The worst thing is that he is tenured on campus for research so he can not be fired.
530,729507,1.0,2.0,"This man did the BARE minimum for an online course. No drop test (which is a norm in bio), and towards the end of the semester, didn't upload a lecture because he thought the pdf would be enough for us to TEACH OURSELVES. I expected more from a university professor. I am not paying tuition for this kind of low effort performance this semester."
531,729507,2.0,4.0,"Doesnt give many assignments to learn or track your progress, a few short, timed quizzes and big, difficult tests."
532,729507,2.0,4.0,Took his class online and he was not organized at all. We would receive notes three days before the test. He was also bad at responding to emails at a reasonable time. Test are hard and you have to know every detail even if they are not in the notes. The lectures and notes all matched up and he explained the material very well.
533,729507,3.0,4.0,"Holder is basically the only option for Bio 2. Many people don't prefer him and I was very nervous about his class, but he isn't all that bad. He reads his PowerPoint the entire class and gives some explanation. He doesn't tolerate phones at all &amp; will call you out, so sit further back! Test 2 is the hardest, but every test is fair."
534,729507,1.0,3.0,"Lousy professor, anybody can read a powerpoint, which is all he does. Could not care less when emailed about problems. Generally unhelpful professor."
535,729507,5.0,2.0,"A lot of people do not like Mr. Holder, but I took him for Bio 2 and Bio of Vertebrates, and he is an awesome prof. He really knows his stuff. You have to go to class to get the notes, but if you study hard, you will do great. For Bio of Vertebrates, the lab is pretty hard, but just take pictures and turn them into flashcards and you will be fine."
536,729507,3.0,3.0,okay listen he wasn't the best but if you take notes and study them carefully you should do fine
537,729507,1.0,4.0,"Do not recommend. Reads off slides in a monotone voice, doesn't make any effort to help students learn the material, difficult to understand what will/won't be on the test, notes not organized in a way conducive to learning the material effectively, little connections made with material due to bullet-point slides of information."
538,729507,3.0,5.0,"This class is HARD. Ive never struggled in a biology class before, but this class is very difficult. He doesnt post his slides, and there is a lot to get down in class. There is a lot of material. I regularly had 25+ pages of notes for each test. Definitely take the SI option if available."
539,729507,1.0,4.0,Very had. Doesn't post powerpoints. Take notes the whole class and very quickly. Most information is not on the test. Also mentions a lot of extra material making it more time consuming to study.
540,729507,2.0,4.0,Very hard. Does not care about any extenuating circumstances. Took notes like the world was ending
541,729507,3.0,4.0,"This class was very difficult for me. He uses power point slides and test material comes exactly from notes. It is A LOT of material, and most of the time the things he spends the most time talking about aren't even on the exam. I've never struggled in biology but this class was a different story."
542,729507,3.0,3.0,"The class is not very challenging at all. 100% of the info on the exams comes from lecture notes, so anything from the textbook is extra knowledge. Anything he says by mouth is not important; all that matters is what he writes down or has on the slides. If you can copy his lecture notes verbatim and recite them without flaw, you will ace this class"
543,729507,3.0,3.0,"You have 4 exams all 75 questions and lab grade. If you are struggling on the tests, take your lab quiz seriously because they can hurt or help a lot. He goes very fast through his lectures and you will write at least four or five pages of notes per lecture. Do not miss class because he does not post online. You will need to study not just memorize"
544,729507,3.0,3.0,"He effectively presents the material in a manner that everyone is able to understand. The material is not hard at all and easy to understand but it is a lot of material for each test. From what Ive seen regarding what other Bio 2 classes have to study, Holders class has it better. Do recommend him even though he hates teachnology in class. Study."
545,729507,3.0,5.0,"Attendance is not mandatory, but it is where you will get all of your notes, because he doesn't release them online. Tests are straight forward, but span several chapters. SEVERAL. If you're used to never studying like me, you will get railed by the tests as they are not concept based. Tests are straight memorization, and if that's your thing, good"
546,729507,3.0,4.0,"I have him for bio of verts and I love the class because I get to learn a lot about vertebrate animals, but there is a lot of material and the test are all handwritten and they are really hard, unless you want something to struggle in I wouldnt suggest this class."
547,729507,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Holder is a great teacher. He is interested in the material he teaches, but some would disagree because his sense of humor is very dry. His tests are hard, but definitely not impossible because I made an A in his class. He doesn't post his notes online and you should read the chapters like once but don't go into bio II thinking it will be easy"
548,729507,1.0,4.0,boring lecture hard. too much material to study when 70% is on the test.
549,729507,4.0,4.0,"Holder is a great professor. He goes a little fast, but if you take notes and pay attention in class you will do fine. He does not post his notes so the class is mandatory to pass. He also talks kind of quiet so I would sit near the front."
550,729507,3.0,4.0,The first two tests are difficult for no reason which really makes it hard to pull out an A in the class. The last two tests are very easy if you just pay attention and study a little. My biggest complaint is that he has long sections of matching on his tests which really drag your grade down. He's an okay professor but nothing to write home about.
551,729507,3.0,3.0,&quot;So what we're gonna do is..&quot; I've had better and I've had worse. He gets the information across fine but lectures are long and boring. The first two tests are unreasonably difficult and you do need to study but if you show up to class and review notes you'll do just fine.
552,729507,4.0,4.0,"Honestly-- just go to class. His class isn't easy, but Bio 2 is a class that weeds out the ones in harder science majors. Holder does well at explaining that to his students. If you do well in his class, you're set. I used the book only to explain concepts I didn't understand clearly. GO TO SI."
553,729507,1.0,4.0,"He is a boring teacher who just talks the entire time. I do not recommend him, but if you're in my situation he is your only choice for BIO 2. Good luck!"
554,729507,3.0,4.0,"First of all, if you don't go to class and take notes you will not pass. He goes through slides during class, but he will not put them online and he doesn't allow computers during class so you have to struggle writing everything down. DO NOT TAKE HIM! Every tests has close to seven chapters each so its a lot of material to remember"
555,729507,3.5,3.0,"Tom Holder is a decent guy.  His tests are hard and covers a lot of material, but they are all fair. Show up to class, take notes, and study, and you'll be fine"
556,729507,2.0,4.0,"Lectures are super long and boring. He covers material very quickly, so sometimes it's hard to keep up, especially if you write your notes. He also speaks too softly, so make sure you sit in the first few rows so you can actually hear him. You DO NOT need the book; everything you need for tests is covered in notes. HARD TESTS though! Don't skip!!"
557,729507,1.0,3.0,He has a monotone voice and his lectures are very long and quick. you take a lot of notes but the tests are pretty straight forward.
558,729507,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Holder is a pretty easy teacher. You really don't need to read the textbook. All of his tests are hard, but come directly from the lecture material. It is really important to be in class. All tests are multiple choice/matching but 75 questions long. He talks some about evolution, but not as much as a lot of other professors. Good professor."
559,729507,3.0,4.0,"Tom Holder is a great teacher, but you have to be willing to put the effort into his class. His tests are taken from all the notes, but they are pretty difficult.  As long as you attend class and pay attention to the lectures, you should be fine. "
560,729507,5.0,1.0,"Straight forward, respectable guy. Those in his classes now that fail either don't study or don't go to class. It isn't ridiculous for a college student to do those things. A rated teacher IMO."
561,729507,3.0,3.0,Nice guy. He can be super boring
562,729507,4.5,2.0,He is a very good professor. Notes are easy to take. He vary rarely refers to the textbook. I would suggest him to anyone.
563,729507,3.0,3.0,"Don't bother buying the textbook. Tests are hard, but fair. Highly recommend going to class every single time."
564,729507,5.0,2.0,"Tom Holder is a great teacher and he clearly cares about his students. There are no drop grades and not much by the way of extra credit, but you shouldn't need it.  He rarely, if ever, uses the book (I never bought it), and he goes at an easy-to-follow pace.  I will take another class with him if I can."
565,729507,2.0,4.0,"If you can avoid taking Tom Holder, do it. Attending class is mandatory, and he doesn't put his notes online. His tests have 75 questions on them and cover a wide range of material."
566,729507,5.0,2.0,"Holder is a great teacher! His tests come directly from the notes he gives in class, but he doesn't put all of the notes online so you really have to go to class. Textbook is not a big deal. I barely used mine."
567,729507,4.5,1.0,"As long as you are in class and taking good notes, you will do great! The tests are 75 multiple choice ?s that come straight from the notes. He also gives bonus questions from random in class quizzes, so again if you go to class you will do well!"
568,729507,4.0,3.0,"MUST GO TO CLASS. make sure to take good notes. his notation a bit hard to understand, but he's willing to answer any questions. he does not go by the book, so dont bother with it unless you want clarification on his drawings"
569,729507,4.5,2.0,"Not too hard, just go to class, listen, and take notes. I thought the class was interesting and that some of the stuff he said was funny. I like his mannerism and glasses. He's always willing to admit to and correct any mistakes he makes. Overall great professor."
570,729507,3.5,2.0,"He teaches from notes, so attend class so you don't miss something.  His tests are straight forward. Mostly definitions. He rarely tries to trip you up. Hes not very interesting to listen to but if you enjoy biology then hes an easy pick."
571,729507,2.0,5.0,"chalk board is all he knows, he doesnt even turn around to talk to the class... you will take lots and lots of notes, and thats all, he doesnt tell you what is on the tests at all, and he ROCKS out his 1960 glasses"
572,729507,2.5,5.0,Needs to learn to actully teach not just give notes. His material is so in deepth that you can not learn anything unless you have had prior plant classes.
573,729507,4.0,5.0,Boring as hell class but nice teacher.
574,729507,3.5,2.0,"If you just take notes from class and study them for the test, you'll do fine. The book is only needed for clarification of his cell drawings. Pretty easy class if you study."
575,729507,4.0,2.0,If you study definintions and the main topics that could be discussion question you will do good. You have to go  to class for the notes because he doesnt use the book. I think he is a great teacher and I really enjoy his classes.
576,729507,3.0,5.0,No Comments
577,1810877,5.0,1.0,Great professor
578,1810877,5.0,1.0,Good teacher!  He comes to class prepared to teach and the essays are easy to write.
579,1638853,1.0,5.0,"Unfair grading, classes are very stretched out and boring. Would not recommend it to anyone."
580,1638853,1.0,5.0,Tough teacher. Lectures are not interesting and there are few grades throughout the semester.
581,1638853,2.0,5.0,"Terrible teacher. Tests were too long and intensive, study guides were no help, lectures were mind numbingly boring."
582,2417097,5.0,3.0,"Sarah is phenomenal! She made psychology entertaining and interesting. Her tests are very straightforward, so if you study, you'll do fine. She doesn't try to trick you, and she will sometimes drop test questions is many miss them. She is very caring and is great at explaining the subject. She also gives funny and memorable examples."
583,2417097,4.0,3.0,"Pretty new, but still amazing. She is a grad student so she is very understanding! Before each test she gives a review with everything you need to know. Gives extra credit here and there. You don't have to do any reading for the class, or at least the year that I am taking her. I highly recommend taking her."
584,745930,1.5,4.0,She is very difficult and not clear on instructions. Very hard grader. Doesn't give extra credit.
585,745930,3.0,2.0,There is a lot of class discussion on the reading assignments. She is very technical about grammar. Counts off a point for every grammatical error. She would give me great feedback on my paper and but my grade never reflected it. She will red pen you to death.
586,745930,2.0,5.0,She wants you to write like a robot... She is also not a big fan of men... Her tests are easy while you are taking them but afterwards you realize how nit picky she is... If you don't agree with her opinion she will count your answer as wrong
587,745930,3.0,3.0,"She's quite stuck up. Goes religiously by her syllabus but one day forgot to bring a print out for us to read and required us to come by her office to pick it up. I worked full time for the university and missed coming by. Not only did I do poorly on the test, but I missed out on extra credit. I complained and she screamed and cussed at me."
588,745930,4.0,5.0,When she grades paper she is to technical good luck making a passing grade.
589,745930,3.0,2.0,"She grades fairly and wants you to do well. She gives you some choice when it comes to essay topics. Had maybe 2 homework assignments all semester. Read what she tells you to, she sometimes has a quiz which is easy if you read. She gives bonus points for coming to class on certain days and bringing your book. There is no final exam. Take her."
590,745930,5.0,1.0,really nice and pretty easy.
591,745930,5.0,2.0,She is always helpful and never too much work at one time. She fairly and is nice.
592,1647067,4.0,1.0,I absolutely loved Mrs. Vines! She can be tough sometimes but you can tell that she truly cares about her students!
593,1647067,3.5,1.0,"She goes off on random stories but she tells you things about teaching that you'll never really learn in school. She teaches you how to decorate your room in a way where it's not too busy, etc. She helped me with advising even if she wasn't my advisor."
594,1647067,1.0,3.0,"Absolutely useless teacher and advisor, couldn't keep any info straight. The entire department was a joke!"
595,2736615,5.0,1.0,"There are 3 weekly assignments due on Sunday every week consisting of a chapter quiz, video quiz, and discussion post. There are 4 exams that all require the LockDown Browser. The class was not difficult at all. Do not buy the book. I would definitely recommend taking this class online, not in person."
596,2736615,5.0,1.0,"Weekly assignments include a quiz, discussion post, video quiz, and test every few weeks. Downloaded the book which was helpful on quizzes, but never used it otherwise. This is a very easy class, he sends out lecture videos but they aren't necessary to pass."
597,2802157,1.0,5.0,"McGee taught my lab, and honestly he just made it harder than it should have been. He never answers questions, and he tests on stuff he might have said once in lab and isn't on any handouts. He doesn't respect his students. "
598,2802157,3.0,4.0,"McGee lectures are very in depth but interesting. his exams are harder but if you study hard for them they are passable. he isn't big on extra credit but might give it once depending on how everyone is doing. overall the class is very interesting and he is a great teach, but the exams are hard and in depth. "
599,2802157,1.0,5.0,He makes this lecture really complicated for no reason. Try to to take it during the spring semester
600,2802157,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this professor. He lectures on things that are not in the curriculum for the course and causes us to fall so behind in class. Then, he blamed us for asking questions because we were so behind. I honestly do not thing he wants students to succeed in this course because he implied multiple times that we are incapable. "
601,2802157,1.0,4.0,Made it more difficult than it should be
602,2802157,1.0,5.0,"Asks very detailed and seemingly random questions rather than questions on important topics that will be used in our careers. Animal Science is a 1000 level class for a DYING major, and McGee needs to stop trying to make it a weeder course to fuel his ego. Nobody made an A on test one and there was no curve. Hopefully the admin will talk to him."
603,2802157,1.0,5.0,.
604,2802157,1.0,5.0,"He teaches very fast and puts too much information on tests for a freshman-level course. On one test, no one in the 200-person class received an A, and he refused to curve the grades. He asked very detailed questions, so studying for his class is very time-consuming, tedious, and stressful. "
605,2802157,1.0,5.0,Most disrespectful professor I have ever spoken to. 
606,2564592,3.0,4.0,"I am a visual learner, and she tends to skip a lot of steps, so when I go back to my notes its just a bunch of skipped around worked problems that she writes in class. Class is mandatory, will affect your grade if you do not go. Homework and quiz due every week. Sometimes there are 2 in a week. Quizzes must be taken in the math domain."
607,2564592,5.0,5.0,Course can be difficult but youll start to understand since she explains very well
608,2564592,5.0,4.0,"She is not a fun math teacher. When going to her class expect to learn and nothing else. She doesn't bend in what she looks for. All that being said, I still feel like she is an amazing teacher. She thoroughly explains her subject and was easy to understand. She worked at a good pace and did a good job answering any questions in class."
609,2564592,4.0,3.0,Very organized. You know what to expect each week. Take notes in class they will help you with your homework and quizzes. Tests are a little harder if you don't fully understand but overall not too difficult.
610,2564592,5.0,1.0,"I had Mrs. Walters for a First Year Experience course so it wasn't hard at all. As long as you participate you will get an A. Also, I learned lots about campus in her class and she was super helpful with whatever questions you have. She even set up a tutoring session for the students in FYE that needed help with a math class."
611,2564592,5.0,3.0,"I LOVED Ms. Kim!! I felt that her tests were pretty easy. She has a lot of multiple-choice questions which really helps with some questions. I do love math, but I feel like she explained everything pretty well. There are 10 homework and quizzes due throughout the semester which was probably the most time-consuming thing she asked."
612,2564592,3.0,4.0,"She gives you her PowerPoint to print out and fill in, but she rushes through the material. You need to go to class but be aware all the questions on the homework and quizzes are not covered in class, so you have to teach yourself. The test reviews are helpful for the tests, but, again, not all the material on the test is covered in the review."
613,2564592,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Walters is easy to reach and always responded to my emails. There's weekly homework and quizzes that are due every Friday. I'm not a big math person, so it wasn't my favorite class."
614,2564592,5.0,2.0,I took Walters for Calculus for Business and Life Sciences and I loved her! I have always been pretty good at math and this class was no different. There were many chances on the homework and she drops 3 quizzes. Watch lectures and attend class if you want to do well. She helps more if you are participating. She explains things very well!
615,2564592,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Walters is a very good lecturer who cares for each of her students. I did well in this class considering I am not very good at math. This class is note heavy meaning showing up to class is essential. I highly recommend her as a lecturer for either college algebra or business calculus.
616,1999350,4.0,5.0,Dr. Campbell really just gets a bad rep because of the difficulty of econometrics. Homework took between 4-8 hours to complete and is annoying but its honestly what is necessary to do good on the exams. The class is curved and he awards copious partial credit as long as you dont leave questions blank. Try on the homework and youll be fine.
617,1999350,1.5,4.0,"Randy is no help at all. Does not email students, does not use mycourses for student updates, does not use powerpoints at all. Basically, it's you and the book. "
618,2744844,5.0,4.0,"Absolutely amazing professor. You have to pay attention in class and take notes in order to do well in the class. Attendance is not mandatory, but if you want a good grade, go to class. Not a lot of grades in the class, so studying helps. Great sense of humor and can almost always make students laugh. Dr. Ezell is an all around great professor!"
619,2744844,5.0,2.0,"For Hydrology and Rocks & Minerals Class. Down to earth and understanding. Explains clearly with many visuals and colorful slide presentations. Assignment requirements are clear. Quizzes aligns to lectures. Expectations are clear. Voice a bit monotonous, but listen carefully and you'll hear jokes! I'd take him for every class if I could! Love him!"
620,2744844,5.0,3.0,"The class was a little boring, but he was super reasonable and very straightforward. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you go and halfway pay attention, the tests will be a lot easier. He recognized that most of the class was just taking him for the science credit, and he was very friendly and approachable. "
621,2744844,2.0,2.0,"Boring. Just boring. I only took Geology bc I'm a business major and it wasn't too bad. 3 quizzes, 2 assignments (a 1-page paper and 1 video), and 3 exams. It wasn't near as bad as chemistry and attendance isn't required. But be prepared to be bored."
622,1335846,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors in Mississippi State University.
623,1335846,3.0,3.0,"ME4123 is an A/B course where your grade is determined by 6 pop quizzes (easy), 1 group paper (easy), 1 final exam (medium), and 1 group project (tough and open ended, large grade percentage). To do well you need a decent short term memory and good randomly assigned groups. This is a split level course that feels like a seminar (poor depth)."
624,1335846,3.0,3.0,"Failures is an A-B class. If you get a C, you messed up bad. Lecture consists mainly of powerpoint case studies loosely based on different topics. He is a good lecturer, but he often talks over my head. 6 true-false &amp; multiple choice quizzes that really just test your short term memory. Project is really hard and you will not get a lot of guidance."
625,1335846,5.0,4.0,"He has enough knowledge to explain mechanics of solid material regarding multiscale. If you a graduate student, highly recommend to take any of his classes."

627,1335846,5.0,1.0,He is AWESOME :)
628,2171433,1.0,5.0,"He uses opinionated grading, not accurate grading. This is a major issue because the vast majority of the class grade is based simply on the tests. The class structure is horrific and Zinsou being considered a ""professor"" is an insult to humanity.  
Do not take a class with him unless you want to experience utter misery. "
629,2171433,5.0,3.0,Always was helpful when I had questions. As long as you participate in discussions he is a great professor. I would definitely recommend.
630,2171433,1.0,4.0,"He made the course very difficult. Went through a slideshow very fast and just lectured the entire time. Had very very few grades with two very tough exams, which nearly made up our entire grades. When most of the kids did bad on the first one he was forced to give some assignments and we still didn't have 10. He is also quite arrogant and rude."
631,2171433,1.0,3.0,"Lectures were terrible they gave you like no information and he went so fast you don't have time to copy it all down. Won't post anything online, overly tough grader, and honestly was rude to me."
632,2171433,1.0,4.0,"He is horrific. I would never recommend this professor ever. We had to listen to 2 hour podcasts every week for homework and reading. It was pathetic and he would always grade so hard for no reason. If you don't participate then your grade will suffer. Never recommended, take it from me. On top of that he is very boring and laughs at his own jokes."
633,2171433,2.0,4.0,"There was a quiz nearly every week in the discussion class and they were absurdly hard. Only other grades were midterm, final, and a research paper. Paper was fairly easy, but the midterm and final were strictly essays and your grade was up to interpretation. No clear grading scale, made an A hard to get considering he is just a grad student."
634,2171433,1.0,5.0,He gives the hardest quizzes every week. Impossible to pass. He is very cocky.
635,1868333,5.0,2.0,Mr. Goree was excellent. My enjoyment of his classes lead me to Marketing.
636,2032188,3.0,3.0,"I really didn't like Foundations, but she made it bearable enough to not want to mentally check out every time I walked in. Her lectures are scattered, we didn't get to the end of the curriculum, and there is a ridiculous amount of homework, but her tests are the easiest things you could ask for given this course. Overall, her course was okay."
637,2032188,4.0,3.0,"She is very caring and considerate, pushing homeworks back and extending them if you ask. Although it is hard to understand her sometimes, the homework matches the test. I have not come in contact with a problem I have not seen before. She is very straight to the point, which I prefer."
638,2032188,3.0,5.0,"She writes notes by hand on a chalk board. Has awful handwriting and a thick accent so its hard to know what the subject is. Her definitions are just examples. She started to upload notes after October. Thats helpful. Her tests arent too hard, she pushes homework assignments back. She tells you exactly what will be on the tests. Hard but nice"
639,2032188,1.0,3.0,Records lectures. Gotta pay for Pearson. Weekly homework use MyLabMath to show you an example on problems. Very scattered. Will randomly post assignments without warning. Gives very little time on quizzes that are worth 10% of grade. Learn using Pearson Study Plan. Class is just for due dates. Beg for extra credit and push due dates. Doesn't email
640,2032188,1.0,4.0,"She has a very thick accent and hard to read handwriting, making understanding her lectures difficult. It is unclear when things are due or when things are. She is completely inaccessible outside of class as she does not respond to emails. Her lectures are extremely boring. I would only take her if it is your only choice. She is not good."
641,2032188,1.0,5.0,"Wasnt a fan. Her accent is bad, she is so hard to understand, sometimes hard to get in contact with. Doesnt help a lot."
642,2032188,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Ballamoole gives boring lectures, was inaccessible outside of class--never responded to a single email I sent her during the semester (some of which involved my test submission), and her handwriting and accent can make it hard to follow her in lecture. I wouldn't recommend taking her if you can help it."
643,2032188,2.0,4.0,"Took her for Linear, she did not teach the material very well and gave us only 3 attempts on homework problems. Also gave review quizzes the day before the tests that were basically another test. The tests themselves were multiple choice and easy. Her handwriting is bad and the lectures do not flow very well, but she does seem to care."
644,2032188,1.0,4.0,This professor is awful. She gave us no help on any review for the tests. She gave the class review quizzes that took over 4 hours for one attempt. I would never take this professor again.
645,2032188,1.0,3.0,"Lectures are unclear and disorganized. We were behind in material and had to cover almost half the class in the last weeks of the semester. She gave us an extra credit opportunity, but did not tell us how it would be applied. I did not make a 100 on the extra credit but she put it in a category that had a 100 so it hurt my grade and she left it in"
646,2032188,1.0,5.0,"She covers material slowly and chaotically. She is extremely disorganized. At one point, our class was an entire month behind in material. To make up the time, in the last couple of weeks, we ended up covering 3-4 times the material we were originally scheduled to. Furthermore, her handwriting is barely legible, and her accent is very thick."
647,2032188,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Ballamoole's lectures made the class boring. Halfway through the semester nearly the entire class stopped taking notes due to a lack of interest. The pacing was awful, often ending in the middle of a chapter or a problem that would never get finished. The material overall was not that difficult but I often found I had to teach it to myself."
648,2032188,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Ballamoole's lectures are excessively boring, to the point where I really don't think anyone in the class was actually taking notes by the end of the semester. My friends and I all taught ourselves the concepts by doing the online homework. Tests often have questions/concepts that aren't on the test review quiz, so be prepared for that."
649,2032188,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Ballamoole is a good option for Linear Algebra. At times, her lectures can be confusing, but if you pay attention to the examples she works in class, you will be fine. She does have an accent, but she is understandable most of the time and willing to clarify if needed. Overall, she's a good professor for a decent course."
650,2032188,4.0,5.0,"Though she has an accent she's not hard to understand if you pay attention. Decent amount of homework but if you actually do it, you should do fine in the class."
651,2032188,4.0,5.0,"She explains things fairly well and though she has an accent, it's not hard to understand her if you pay attention. Homework is boring but if you actually do it, you should have no problem with the class."
652,2032188,1.0,2.0,"The material covered in this class is super easy but Dr. Ballamoole makes it very difficult. She gives loads of homework, and hardly lets out of lecture early. Also lectures are horrifically boring. Do not take Dr. Ballamoole for Linear Algebra."
653,2032188,5.0,4.0,"It's wise to try to find friends around you in her class if possible; she will help you if you are lost. She goes over a lot of material quickly, but her notes are excellent: write what she writes on the overhead, don't write what she draws on the chalkboard unless it helps. I enjoyed going to her class. I would definitely take her again."
654,2032188,5.0,3.0,She is very nice and helpful. She teaches really fast.
655,2032188,4.0,2.0,Snehalatha Ballamoole is a good teacher for LA. Why? Cause she cares about her students. She takes time to grade each test and if you're showing up to class and participating she remembers that. She seems to care whether or not her students are learning the material. She has stopped a number of times to explain concepts more in depth when asked.
656,2032188,2.0,4.0,"In her Intro to Linear Algebra class, she teaches directly from the book. I don't think she is an effective teacher. Rather than subjects that built upon what we had already learned, it seemed like we had to reinvent the wheel with every lecture. Tests are built off of the quizzes, and she grades very reasonably"
657,2392644,5.0,2.0,"She cares a lot about what she teaches. There is always an in class review before each test, I would definitely show up for those!"
658,2392644,4.0,3.0,Flickinger is really cool! Honestly I zoned out a lot through lectures. She always does an in class test review the class before the test and lets you take pictures of the slides with the questions. Those questions are pretty much the test with a few added questions. I ended up with a B but that was my fault bc I didnt study well for test 2.
659,2392644,4.0,2.0,Professor Flickinger is very passionate about Geography and it shows through her lectures. She reads straight from the powerpoint but she always gives more explanations if need be. There are weekly map quizzes! She gives a lot of extra credit if you just show up to class. All test have 50 questions and she gives you the questions and answers prior!
660,2392644,4.0,2.0,"Didn't use the textbook once. Very clear about what's on the test. Review days are a blessing, she gives everything on the test. Posts lectures online. Definitely an easy A."
661,2392644,4.0,1.0,"Mrs. Flickinger is young, fresh out of college, and super chill. She gave clear instructions on how to get an A in her class and that is exactly what it took. Her lectures aren't too bad, just show up most days for extra credit and also the day before for the review day, because she gives exactly what you need for the test."
662,2785864,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Walker's class is hard, but he does try to make the material somewhat easier. He's lecture heavy and his tests are departmental exams so you'll be taking the exam with 400+ other students in separate rooms. Homework will save your grade if you fail every exam, so make sure you get an A on each assignment. "
663,2785864,4.0,5.0,He is going to be the best bet for accounting. This class is really hard however he does teach it well. The issue is the tests they are departmental exams which means he has no idea what will be on them. You will take the test with every other student at MSU taking this class at the same time on the same day. Make sure to show up. Good luck.
664,2638410,1.0,3.0,"This professor would not allow me to make up homework or tests with a doctors note, I was very sick for a week and she would not let me make up any work. I had to contact the dean of students for her to let me do any of my assignments/tests and she still only let me get 70% back. "
665,2638410,5.0,2.0,"Professor Riahi is literally one of my favorite professors I have ever had. She provides blank lecture notes, doesn't take attendance, and was super accessible outside of class. She was always in a great mood also! Final is optional which is great. Homeworks could be difficult, but they weren't impossible if you understood the lecture."
666,2638410,5.0,2.0,"Such a sweet teacher! She wanted everyone to succeed and was always accessible for office hours outside of class! As long as you paid attention and tried, the tests were really easy. Such a great professor. "
667,2638410,5.0,3.0,"Great, super nice. 1-2 Homeworks a week. If you're happy with your grade after test 3 then final's optional. Attending class is optional. Go into test with solid understanding of material for A, some questions not from homework."
668,2638410,1.0,5.0,"This was probably one of the hardest classes I've taken at State when it definitely shouldn't of been. Her lectures were awful and always so unclear, her homework was so hard, and her tests never reflected the homework."
669,2638410,4.0,3.0,"She's nice and at first, the information matched the test but in the end, the review was nothing like the exam. Class is boring."
670,2638410,5.0,2.0,Dr. Riahi is a great teacher. Super caring and helpful. She made Stats1 easy. Go to class and do homework and you should have no problem getting in here. Pretty basic math and content. Reviews are very similar to exams. 10/10 teacher.
671,2638410,5.0,3.0,"My class was hybrid, but I just attended the live lectures. She explains in great depth and color coordinates so it's easy to see what's happening! I highly recommend her! She is also super nice and helpful if you have any questions!"
672,2638410,5.0,2.0,Definitely take her! She made stats super easy and everything was very straightforward. I thought she was very clear about her expectations and followed through on everything.
673,2638410,4.0,3.0,"I took this class online during the winter. It was very time consuming. The videos are long. She provides videos that contain the lectures, recitations, and reviews for each chapter. There are only 3 tests and an optional final. Tests can be hard. Make sure to study everything not just the reviews. She will respond to emails and is very helpful!"
674,2638410,4.0,3.0,"I took her during covid-19, so the class was online. The material isn't that hard, as long as you attend the lectures and do the hw. Practice practice practice. She answered all of my emails and was always willing to help students. Take her!"
675,2531927,1.0,5.0,She expect you to live in Teams! She wants you post random stuff on there while we have other classes and life.  Tough grader with least amount of resources. 
676,2531927,5.0,3.0,One of the best online classes I have ever taken. She is incredibly organized and runs a tight ship. Participation is what she is after so when it says to write constructive comments for your teammates do that. She wants everyone to succeed not only in her class but in their future cares as well. Chose this instructor for any Tech writing class.
677,2638430,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed taking French I and II with Mme. Spearman! She is such a caring and sweet professor and she really wants you to do well in her class! There is a good bit of homework, but it really does pay off in the end. All of a sudden you realize you know more French than you thought!"
678,2638430,5.0,3.0,I love Mme. Spearman! I struggled with French in high school but she made this class a breeze. Shes so sweet and really cares about you and your grade so dont be afraid to reach out to her! I cant wait for French II.
679,2785894,1.0,2.0,"probably one of the most condescending people (not just profs) I've ever met. Speaks to you like youre 5 y/o. lectures have nothing to do with course title, and we've only had two lectures within the 1st 4weeks of class. all I can say is: total. karen. energy!! Do not take her, you won't learn anything and you'll get belittled while doing it. "
680,131717,5.0,3.0,I loved her! I loved the lab for digital devices! She was nice to those who came to class. I understood her very well!
681,131717,3.0,4.0,"Lots of Homework. Labs can take longer than the time allotted. Records lectures. Tests are heavily based on the old tests. Attend class mostly to hear about extra credit opportunities and have test problems worked. Textbook is very helpful. Make friends in lab, work as a big group."
682,131717,1.0,3.0,Disorganized and unprofessional.
683,131717,4.0,4.0,"Jane doesn't deserve the hate she gets for Digital Devices. It is just difficult. She has always been available outside of class to help; however, most people don't seek help. I anticipated an A, but the 3rd Exam is a lot to understand. Likewise, the final has a lot of exam 3 in it. She teaches well, but most students don't pay attention in class."
684,131717,2.0,3.0,"Very unorganized and very much not on top of things. Multiple times the class would have to steer her in the right direction. Can become frustrating. However, she is extremely nice!"
685,131717,4.0,4.0,Mrs. Moorhead is a pretty good professor. She can be all over the place at times but her class is fairly easy if you manage to pay attention the whole time.
686,131717,4.0,2.0,"Not available outside class. Tests are straight from zybook, study it diligently and timing diagrams. Labs aren't too bad after the wiring ones, but the TAs won't really help you. She is very caring and understanding IF you catch her before or after class. Equally nice over email but doesn't respond very quickly."
687,131717,5.0,4.0,She is unorganized but shes fair about it. If you email her she will happily give more time if she feels like she made a mistake. The labs are a little out of date but she would come into lab to help out the TA's. She has no sympathy for people who skip. Actually go through and read the Homework. Its a 3000 level class so its hard but shes great.
688,131717,1.0,4.0,If you looked up a picture of &quot;unorganized&quot; it pulls up a picture of her. Her lectures of completely useless and are best spent doing the Zybooks chapter she assigns every week. The labs are worse than the lecture. She would tell us to work through multiple pages of a workbook and home before lab just to change it when we got to lab. Avoid her.
689,131717,1.0,2.0,Moorhead was awful. Worst professor I've had yet. She does not care about her students. Her lectures are awful. You're better off just teaching yourself from zyBooks.
690,131717,1.0,5.0,"One moment she is teaching a chapter, the other moment she is already jumped into some other chapter. Her erratic behavior in teaching a topic is a pain creating confusion for you. This course is already difficult and she makes it more. Her test answers are often wrong. TA's have no idea of the labs going on."
691,131717,1.0,5.0,She has the wrong answers on the quizzes and tests most of the time.
692,131717,2.0,4.0,"If you've heard a certain rhyming nickname for Jane Moorhead, just know that it's 100% accurate. She is incredibly scatterbrained and erratic, she gives a ton of quizzes (part of the reason my grade tanked early in this course), and her labs are so convoluted that not even the TAs know what's going on half the time."
693,131717,1.0,4.0,"She teaches you though quizzes, so if you don't understand the material then you fail the quizzes. Somehow this is supposed to help you? I tried taking notes for her lectures but her lectures were so shambled I hardly learned anything. Labs were probably the most miserable 3 hours of my week; my poor TAs didn't know what was happening. Good luck..."
694,131717,1.0,4.0,Terrible. Lectures all over the place. Labs all over the place. No consistency everywhere. Erratic behavior towards students. Would not recommend. Needs significant improvement as instructor.
695,131717,1.0,5.0,Shes knowledgeable in what shes teaching but as a teacher she is horrible. Gets off topic quite a bit and her personality convinces me she comes to class coked up. In circuits we had maybe 1-2 classes in between tests so everything feels rushed. The hw load is heavy and does not prepare you for the tests. The bad reviews on here are accurate.
696,131717,1.0,5.0,"Amazing EE. Terrible professor. All over the place while lecturing. Gets distracted easily. Difficult to follow her lightning fast pace. Pulls material from multiple sources that are inaccessible to you. Labs are challenging, TAs are terrible. Doesn't show up when she says she will to help you in lab. Hopefully you can teach yourself via homework!"
697,131717,1.0,4.0,"You learn more from the homework than anything else. The main challenges are in the labs. The labs are over 4 years old, and the software used is much older. The instructions have been changed multiple times and have been very unclear. Exams are passable, you NEED to do all assigned homework even if the due date is after the exam you are taking."
698,131717,1.0,4.0,"You learn more from the homework than anything else. The main challenges are in the labs. The labs are over 4 years old, and the software used is much older. The instructions have been changed multiple times and have been very unclear. Exams are passable, you NEED to do all assigned homework even if the due date is after the exam you are taking."
699,131717,1.0,4.0,"Honestly the worst teacher I've ever had. She's extremely sweet, but she is terrible at teaching. All she does during lectures is read off PowerPoints and expect you to already know it. Labs are long and instructions are extremely vague."
700,131717,1.0,3.0,"Ms. Moorhead must be one of the worst teachers I've ever had for a class.  I had her for digital devices and microprocessors (couldn't avoid it either time), and she basically reads off of slides, assumes you know more than you do, and often doesn't go into enough detail on the material.  When I asked questions, her answers usually made no sense."
701,131717,4.0,2.0,"Mrs. Moorhead cares very much about your grade.  Tests ran the gamut of difficulty, but she curves and provides multiple bonus opportunities - the final can replace a test. My only complaint is timing diagrams are not in the book, and are heavily featured in tests. Show up to class, and use her generous office hours for diagrams. Labs need rework."
702,131717,1.5,4.0,"Online tests are buggy and prone to issues, lecture moves at a lightning pace. Material itself is easy enough, but not conveyed well. Prepare to read/watch the textbook, Youtube, etc.  The lab is a joke, it's by far the biggest problem with this class. The TAs legitimately do not know what they're doing, at all. They ask students for help."
703,131717,5.0,3.0,"She is such an amazing teacher, I love her lectures. If you put in any effort at all the class is not too hard. The lab takes some time though."
704,131717,1.0,2.0,"By far the worst teacher I've had so far.  If you are not in an electrical engineering major, steer clear.  She appears to put minimal effort into the class.  Wasted 2 class periods doing nothing but handing back test grades.  Didn't even go over the test, was just handing them out.  Her labs are awful and its clear she doesnt check them first."
705,131717,4.0,3.0,She's really happy and excited about what she teaches. Loves it when people participate and talk in lecture - you'll be on her good side if you do which will make her more receptive to your questions about lab and such. Lab is difficult if you don't read ahead of time. 
706,131717,1.5,5.0,"The worst teacher I've had in the ECE department here at Mississippi State University. Attendance is mandatory to a class where she lectures by reading off of slide shows, and saying an average of five words per slide. Then she assigns homework so you can teach yourself; why even come to class? Highly recommend avoiding this teacher. "
707,131717,1.5,4.0,No Comments
708,131717,5.0,3.0,I was ready to switch to CS until I took Digital - the hardware adder project was fun!!!
709,131717,4.5,3.0,The tests were similar to old tests - this really helped.  She exempts from the final!
710,131717,3.5,3.0,No Comments
711,131717,1.0,5.0,"The semester I took her class, she specifically told us that a certain topic WOULD NOT BE ON THE FINAL EXAM.Of course, nobody reviewed it.It was on the final.She was never prepared for class and didn't have her own notes.I don't know where she got the test material.It wasn't from the lectures."
712,131717,2.0,2.0,"She doesn't really know all the material or teach much, but who learns anything in Intro to ECE anyway&#63; She is often unprepared for class."
713,131717,2.0,3.0,Hope you can teach yourself...
714,131717,4.5,3.0,"Since all of the material was new, I had to work really hard, but I learned a great deal. She never uses the slides (works all problems on the board), just makes them available in case we miss class. The robotics competition was cool."
715,131717,1.5,3.0,"Completely inept.  Boasts that she is preparing you for Engineering--yet she doesn't even have her own notes(she uses Dr. Reese's), or grade her own tests!  She truly doesn't have a shred of concern."
716,131717,4.0,4.0,She gives hard tests but really prepares you for the follow-on courses.  She's willing to help if you ask for it.
717,131717,2.5,4.0,Doesn't go the extra distance in teaching material.  Just covers the basics.
718,131717,2.5,5.0,All she does is read from power point slides.  I warn you against taking her.
719,2433685,5.0,2.0,"Took Ms. Johnson for English Comp and she made everything extremely easy. She allows a rough draft, first draft, and final draft feed back for each of the 3 essays she assigns. She truly wants you to learn. Peer reviews and other class activities are counted as participation grades at the end of the class so beware of skipping these."
720,2433685,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS. I am pre med and spent more time on this course than any other courses for my major this semester. Extremely time consuming and hard grader. If im a 4.0 student, intro to lit should not be where i struggle."
721,2433685,1.0,5.0,"I can not stress this enough, REFRAIN from taking her class. She genuinely believes she is teaching a class full of Literature majors and grades extremely hard for no reason. Taking someone else."
722,2433685,3.0,4.0,Grades extremely hard and gives a bunch of work for no reason.
723,2433685,1.0,5.0,"WORST class I have taken at state so far. Professor Johnson is an EXTREMLY hard grader. She shows NO grace on any mistakes. She gives take home tests, but they take 10 HOURS. It is an intro class but the work load is ridiculous. Lectures over elementary level content then grades with no mercy. Save yourself the tears, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!"
724,2433685,1.0,5.0,"As a person, she's great. But as a teacher? It's a no for me. She grades  hard on the smallest assignments and almost never gives you Full Credit. She doesn't count attendance but she may assign group work that has to be turned in and will be graded. You don't necessarily need the book because all the readings can be found online. 0/10 recommend!"
725,2433685,2.0,4.0,"shes an amazing person, very sweet but she is very harsh when grading. it is very easy to think you did very good on a paper and get a bad grade back in her class. there is so so much work required on a weekly basis, especially for an intro class. no other intro to lit prof is like this, if you have a heavy schedule, stray away from prof johnson!"
726,2433685,3.0,4.0,She a great professor. She loves her cats a lot.
727,2433685,3.0,4.0,"make sure you do the extra credit or itll be very hard to get an A. she grades really hard, but she is accessible if you have questions about her assignments. definitely not an easy A"
728,2433685,1.0,4.0,"Nice person, but not a likable teacher. Grades insanely hard. 10/10 would not recommend."
729,2433685,5.0,3.0,Great instructor! She grade kinda heavy but overall a very caring person
730,2433685,4.0,2.0,Very nice teacher that wants you to be successful. She is a pretty tough grader when it comes to small assignments but I made an 85+ on about every paper. Follow the guidelines on the assignments and go to class and you should be able to get an A. She will definitely try to keep class interesting and fun.
731,2433685,3.0,4.0,Decent teacher. Too many opinion based assignments and she wants your opinions to align with hers.
732,2433685,3.0,4.0,Shes a nice lady and canceled class a decent amount. I honestly think there are better people to take for comp. she grades hard on stupid stuff like homework. I just did not enjoy her class but shes not awful
733,2433685,4.0,3.0,"Seriously the best comp teacher at state. She makes sure that you are prepared for every paper, sometimes to the point that it gets annoying. She can be a tough grader for rough drafts. She gives bonus points on each paper for going to the writing center. She's also suuuuper funny and tries (sometimes too hard) to be relatable."
734,2433685,5.0,2.0,"She is very nice and understanding, while also being able to convey the information clearly."
735,2433685,4.0,2.0,Ms. Johnson is full of energy. She encourages people to come to her if they need help with anything. Clear with assignment instructions (sometimes even gets annoying because she repeats them so much). Grading is kind of inconsistent but it's not hard to get an A in the class.
736,2433685,4.0,4.0,Clear lectures and accessible outside of class
737,2433685,5.0,1.0,She is AMAZING &amp; helpful
738,2433685,5.0,1.0,ms. johnson was a wonderful english instructor. she's relatable to students and understands that most are just taking it to fulfill gen. core. she explains what is expected on the essays and gives you enough time to write them. easy A.
739,1966741,5.0,1.0,"Attendance is mandatory; as long as you print and fill out the powerpoints that she posts online, attend class (she takes roll), participate in discussion, and listen to the ""stories"" told in class you will be fine.  Tests are strictly from powerpoints(with notes) and the inclass discussions so take notes on those. "
740,1876643,4.5,1.0,"Really cool teacher, very informative. The only thing i don't like about his classes are that the lectures are long."
741,2368171,4.0,3.0,"Jonathan was a great instructor! I ended up going to every class even though attendance wasn't mandatory because I found his lectures were actually very helpful. He'll work a problem over and over until you understand it, and he really wants everyone to do well. He's very clear about what he expects, and very accessible outside of class for help!"
742,1090224,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Stinson was my favorite professor this semester. Her honors section of comp II is on detective fiction. You read two short stories for every class period and a play at the end. Three papers and a final reflective paper. Class is discussion based so participate. She is a really fun, nice professor and made me more comfortable about my writing"
743,1090224,5.0,2.0,"I had Dr.Stinson for Intro to Literature. I am not exaggerating this was the best teacher and best class I have taken. You are expected to read a lot throughout the course, however, they are quite fun to read. You are graded on 5 responses, unit test, participation, and a final. Extremely easy and such sweet teacher. If I could I would take again!"
744,1090224,5.0,3.0,Dr. Stinson is so sweet. I had her for accelerated comp 2 and we had 3 papers which included the final paper. There were online quizzes the first few weeks but they weren't bad. She is a great teacher and answers emails fast incase you need help. Actually cares about you and helping you get the grade you want.
745,1090224,5.0,2.0,"Class is graded on five response papers that are opinion-based, three unit exams and a take-home self evaluation final. I really enjoyed this class, as Dr. Stinson made it very enjoyable to attend and the discussions were very helpful for the exams."
746,1090224,5.0,1.0,"For her intro to lit class, we had five major responses due (they held the most weight on my grade). They were all opinion-based, and as long as you put in the effort, you'd get a 100."
747,1090224,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Stinson is a wonderful teacher. I thoroughly enjoyed her class. The assigned readings were not heavy nor overwhelming... just do as you are instructed, engage and participate in class and you will succeed!"
748,1090224,5.0,4.0,"Interesting class. Tries to keep it interesting so everyone remains engaged. Accessible outside of class and more than happy to help with any questions you have. Great professor, would definitely recommend"
749,1090224,4.0,4.0,"I took her for Creative Writing. She does grade hard, but I think I learned a lot from Dr. Stinson. You will need the textbook, but not until later in the semester when you start the fiction unit."
750,1090224,5.0,3.0,"I LOVED Dr. Stinsons class. Not very many things to turn in, so the essays do count for more. She gives lots of feedback and will look over your work if you go by her office hours. I was in a really small class, so the lectures were discussion based. Highly recommend."
751,1090224,2.0,3.0,"This is the type of teacher that will tell you that you did fantastic on an essay, then fail you. The reason for this is that she values an essay that was written exactly how she wanted it over an essay that was actually written well. I would prefer a teacher that gives constructive criticism to a teacher that fails you, but tells you you did great"
752,1090224,5.0,4.0,I absolutely loved Dr. Stinsons class! She was tough but fair and is a fantastic teacher. She gave really good feedback on papers and was always willing to meet with me outside of class. I would absolutely take another class from her.
753,1090224,5.0,4.0,"Loved her so much! Although the amount of reading was a bit overwhelming at the beginning, I got used to it and was able to stay on top of it. No tests for my class, only four papers. Not too bad and not too harsh of a grader. Gives great feedback and is accessible outside of class."
754,1090224,5.0,3.0,Emily Stinson is the BOMB! I had her for Accelerated Comp. II and loved the course. She gives great feedback and advice on papers you write. I honestly looked forward to going to class because discussions were always light hearted and interesting. I would take her again for any course available.
755,1090224,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Stinson is an amazing professor. She is genuine, helpful, hilarious, and understanding. Her class is very discussion based, so participation is key. She WILL know if you don't read. She is a VERY tough grader when it comes to essays, and you honestly may make an F on the first one. But she will help you improve. Overall a great professor."
756,1090224,4.0,2.0,"Easy A class, and there is very little homework. This is a participation heavy class, but it is easy, Socratic Seminar style discussion."
757,1090224,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Stinson is a great teacher. Her Comp. II Honors section is based on detective fiction, which I find more fun and interesting than your average English class. Dr. Stinson is very sweet and caring and wants her students to succeed. The only downside is that she grades essays INCREDIBLY hard. Don't be surprised if you make an F on the first essay."
758,1090224,5.0,2.0,"In this class you have write 7 papers, which sounds like a lot, but 3 are responses to the readings that you do in class (so guaranteed 100s), 3 are basically more developed response essays, and one is a research paper. This prof is awesome and I would take her again in a heartbeat!"
759,1090224,5.0,2.0,She did a good job making the class interesting.  The work load is comparatively light.  Over the semester we wrote 4 essays.  She expects quality though so you have to put in a lot of time on your essay's.  Dr. Stinson also is very clear about what it takes to make a good grade.
760,1090224,4.0,2.0,"Would take her again in a heartbeat, one of the best teachers i have had.  Easy A but you have to put in a little effort, but I would recommend her to everyone"
761,1090224,5.0,2.0,Awesome professor. Very intelligent and insightful but also down-to-earth and always available to help. Pretty easy course as long as you pay attention and actually do the readings.
762,1090224,5.0,3.0,I have never enjoyed English classes until I took her course. If you participate in her class and show an effort she notices. I greatly improved my writing skills in her class. If I have to take another English class I will definitely take another class from her again.
763,1090224,5.0,1.0,"She's a great professor. Really sweet and willing to help answer questions or just help you understand the material. You have to write 7 short papers (responses to the readings) in the class but they're not bad at all. As long as you pay attention and read the material, you'll do fine."
764,1090224,5.0,2.0,Awesom professor. Really helpful. makes things interesting
765,1090224,4.5,2.0,"She is a very sweet woman with the occasional joke. The class consists of writing 7 papers, so if you are a good writer then you should be fine."
766,1090224,2.5,4.0,This lady is kinda rude. She was always very short with me every time I approached her for her. She was generally unavailable. She grades hard and I think unfairly. I have never gotten anything less than an a in English and i may get a c in her class. Try to avoid her class.
767,2417333,4.0,3.0,Great teacher. Notes are very long and are a lot but tests are based off notes.
768,2556600,3.0,3.0,"honestly she's not a mean teacher, sometimes she will work with you, but getting in touch with her if youre not physically with her can be hard. sometimes she waits until the last minute to do things. If you do take her you won't be in a bad predicament, but you def. have to stay on her about things!!"
769,2556600,3.0,4.0,"Ms. LaFluer is a great teacher but her requirements makes her class so difficult. Shes one the teachers where you have to have EVERYTHING exactly how she wants or youll get points taking off for small mistakes!!!!! If youre looking for a easy English teacher, she is definitely not it. As if English isnt stressful enough she makes it no easier!"
770,2540231,5.0,5.0,"Biochemistry II is hard. There are so many pathways. Review them everyday. YES, remember enzymes, is it reversible or not?, exergonic or ender?, is it a regulating step?, how do other pathways come into this one? Homework is harder than test, I used chegg and reviewed how I got it wrong. Make an A in homework it helps with your grade! Read the book"
771,1950413,1.0,1.0,"I took Dr. Wong for Gender Issues in Counseling. Gender isn't his area and he had no idea what he was talking about. He goes on rants about pretty much everything except gender issues. You'll learn lots about his dog though, which was my favorite part of the class. To put it in perspective: I'm a senior and his class is the worst I've had. Ever."
772,2237140,2.0,3.0,"He doesn't seem to know what he's doing with the planet geo class. He gave a vague project with no grading criteria that could be in any format. The test kind of follows the study guide, but the study guide does not match the lecture slides. He's all over the place."
773,2237140,4.0,4.0,"Good Guy! He is South Korean so he is a little hard to understand, but you understand him after a couple of weeks."
774,2237140,3.0,3.0,"He is a really nice guy and knows what he is talking about. it is sometimes hard to know what he is saying, but its manageable. If you arent good with foreign teachers, I wouldnt take him."
775,2237140,4.0,3.0,He's one of the best foreign teachers. He is passionate in what he teaches. I really value him as a teacher.
776,2237140,1.0,3.0,"At first, it was really hard to understand what he was saying because he's from South Korea. Sometimes you'll even have to help him out with a few words. His quizzes/tests are usually grammatically incorrect and make it harder to comprehend. The quizzes are usually harder than the tests. Personally, I don't think he should be teaching."
777,1188570,2.0,3.0,"Let her be your last resort for a teacher if you are trying to learn Spanish. If you just want the credit than take her. She belongs in a high school, not on a college campus. The only positive thing I can say about her is that she has a lot of assignments and drop grades which allows a lot of room for error."
778,1188570,5.0,2.0,"Going to class makes it a lot easier to retain vocab and learn grammar. Conversifi isn't fun, but you have to do it in any Spanish 1 class. The homework is easy, and you can do it in advance. Grade is based on homework, quizzes, conversifi, in class assignments, midterm, final, and discussion boards. There are drop grades for some sections."
779,1188570,2.0,4.0,"I took two years of spanish in high school, and i would not have passed this class if i didnt have prior spanish knowledge. shes just not a good teacher, and moves through lessons way too fast. shes a tough grader and doesnt seem to have much empathy for those who are a bit slower at learning a new language."
780,1188570,4.0,3.0,"I loved Sra. Russel's class. She speaks Spanish in class, but she mostly teaches and speaks in English. She is also super understanding and works with you on whatever you need. There is daily homework, but nothing you can not handle. Every Spanish 1 teacher does the talking with native Spanish speakers so you can't avoid it. Highly recommend her."
781,1188570,1.0,3.0,"Not a good professor. Can tell she loves it but she cannot teach it. She was extremely unwilling to accommodate for me when I had covid, so I had to come to class with covid during a pandemic. Made us pay to speak to native spanish speakers in a Spanish 1 course, before we knew the alphabet. Take Spanish with literally anyone else if you can."
782,1188570,1.0,2.0,"She is one of the worst professors I have ever had. If I could give her a 0 I would. She loves to give assignments she has not taught us anything about and expect us to pass. She makes you take an in person final even though the class is online, and we had never had any other tests. She told us the final was on one thing, and it wasnt on that. Bad!"
783,1188570,3.0,2.0,"She made us do Conversifi as a Spanish I class. She seems like a good enough teacher, but talking to native speakers online as a class of mostly beginners was extremely stressful. It caused unnecessary anxiety for most of the class. She's very nice, but did not care about causing this stress to her students."
784,1188570,1.0,3.0,This class is one of the WORST classes I have ever taken. Taking this online she send us no lectures or extra learning material. You are teaching yourself a foreign language with no help from your professor. I can not stress enough how much this class disappointed me. I was excited about learning spanish but ended up hating it. She is no help/
785,1188570,4.0,4.0,"Shes really nice and has a lot of energy. Class has a lot of homework but its all easy stuff that only takes a few minutes to complete. Lectures dont really help with the homework, so skipping class didnt affect me that much. Choose a good conversation partner at the beginning of class and that will help you."
786,1188570,5.0,3.0,"She makes Spanish lots of fun! DO NOT BUY A PHYSICAL TEXTBOOK because she uses Cengage online. You'll have to study and do homework outside of class, but she's super nice and very engaging."
787,1188570,2.0,4.0,She gives you nothing to prepare for tests. She is very veague. She wonders around during class.
788,1188570,2.0,4.0,I ended Spanish 1 with a high A and barely passed this class with a C. Her lectures were awful and confusing. There were no study guides for any exams. No review sessions. We were on our own. She only spoke in Spanish if it was something she was reading straight out of the textbook. Very odd. Take anyone else. There's plenty other instructors.
789,1188570,4.0,3.0,"Ms Russell is very responsive and helpful. She's young and fun. I took Spanish 1 on line in a condensed 5 week summer session. WARNING - you will have 15-25 assignments per day including weekends, so be sure you have time. It's not super hard - just hours and hours of homework when the whole semester is crammed into 5 weeks. HW is 45% of grade."
790,1188570,2.0,4.0,"Coming in, I had a poor foundation from Spanish 1. I struggled in the class, but Ms. Russell did what she could to help me, but I admitted it too late to save my grade so I just took the L and plan on retaking the class."
791,1188570,3.0,4.0,"I mean, she's okay. I didn't do so hot in Spanish 2, but that's because I hardly learned anything in Spanish 1. Be prepared for a lot of homework due 4 nights a week. Do it, because it can really help (or hurt) your grade at the end."
792,1188570,1.0,4.0,Mrs. Russell is a terrible Spanish teacher; during review times she would be sitting at her desk on her phone and lose track of time and then go over class time because she was goofing off. Then when asked a question about the grammar she doesn't explain and just says that she doesn't know why. Also spoke in English more than 3/4 of the time.
793,1188570,4.0,3.0,"Very straightforward teacher and class. She is not the most accessible outside of class and does not give much explanation on your grade. Be prepared for lots of homework. Nothing was too hard, just put in the work. Lenient on oral exams but very strict on written and listening activities. I am taking her again for Spanish 2, she's enjoyable"
794,1188570,3.0,4.0,"Had a few problems with the professor's teaching style, but once you get used to her it will become more easy. Overall an O.K. professor."
795,1188570,4.0,3.0,"Be prepared to have 4-5 homework assignments a night.  The homework is completed online, and if you misplace an accent mark, the entire question is counted wrong.  Mrs. Russell will not go back and change this for you.  She does tell you exactly what is on each test, and she is very lenient in grading oral exams."
796,1188570,5.0,3.0,"I took her for Spanish I and II and loved it!  As long as you go to class, review regularly, and complete iLrn homework activities, you should do fine."
797,1188570,5.0,2.0,Amie was a terrific teacher! I would definitely recommend her!!
798,1188570,5.0,2.0,She was fantastic if only I could have taken Spanish 2 and 3 with her I might not have done so badly. She is not trying to trick you unlike the other profs and she lets you know what you'll have to know in Spanish 2 so you can master the important stuff.
799,1188570,4.5,1.0,"She's great! The tests and quizzes are very straightforward. She tells you everything that will be on it, and she doesn't try to trick you. She's really cool and funny too"
800,2515682,4.0,3.0,"Matthew Holliday has a very consistent teaching style. The only thing I would have liked more of was seeing his own lecture videos instead of various other faculty members. Also, he is &quot;discussion&quot; heavy for online courses. Discussion aren't bad, but he over used them."
801,2515682,5.0,4.0,He was a great teacher would love to have him again although test were fairly difficult specificly the final exam he was willing to help if you just ask
802,2294507,2.0,4.0,"Soon Ee is easily the most frustrating teacher Ive had. No clear criticism when judging your pieces, even when you ask for clarification. Basically just very condescending and almost made me want to drop out."
803,2294511,5.0,2.0,She is great! She's young and has kids of her own so she's very understanding. Almost all of your work can be completed in class if you show up and work. If you meet the criteria of the project you'll have an A in the class. Very fun and easy going
804,1843955,1.0,3.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS ONLINE! Take the in-person EDF4243 with the other teacher if you are able. This teacher gives massive assignments with extremely short periods of time to finish them and if you email her, she won't respond for a long period of time. If you have to take Ms. Long, watch the vids and look over the materials well. Good luck."
805,1843955,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Long gave me a bad feeling from the start. I took her for a writing class and the first thing she said to us was &quot;I hate writing.&quot; This was during COVID, so we had to swap to online classes and it went down hill from there. She is a tough grader and counts off for every little thing. She does not always answer questions that you email her."
806,1843955,5.0,1.0,Very nice teacher! Always willing to help. Fairly easy class which is a nice break from your intensive education classes.
807,1843957,4.5,3.0,Although not a particularly easy class she is always willing to help. High expectations and will prepare you for working in a classroom!
808,2679572,5.0,3.0,"So kind, energetic, and enthusiastic! I thoroughly enjoyed this class!"
809,2679572,5.0,1.0,"If you are looking for an easy A fine arts class, look no further. Basically show up and you get a 100. He only cares that you show up and does appreciate when you participate. Quizzes you have unlimited attempts to get 100. No tests, textbook, or final. You get to draw on Fridays and that's about it for this class."
810,2679572,5.0,1.0,"If you still need to get your fine arts credit, this is the class to take. This class will be the easiest one you will ever take, and Mr. Ali keeps it interesting."
811,2679572,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Ali is the BEST professor I have ever had and ever will have! There is no tests, no due dates, only quizzes that are super easy. He is so understanding about absences and just anything. He makes class fun; this is the only class that I enjoy going to! He even lets me bring my service dog in training which is a huge help to her learning process!"
812,2679572,5.0,1.0,"He is very interesting, and his class is very chill. He is very understanding."
813,2679572,5.0,1.0,I love his hair and he has impeccable style.
814,2679572,5.0,1.0,Professor Morshedlou is very kind and does his best to make things as fun as possible. He is extremely understanding and flexible. If you go to class you are guaranteed to do well. Would definitely recommend this class if you are looking for a fine art credit.
815,2679572,5.0,1.0,"He was a very interesting professor and makes class fun. There are no exams in this class. There's only quizzes that can be taken at any time during the semester and have unlimited attempts. Attendance is mandatory, but all you have to do is show up. 10/10 would recommend."
816,2679573,5.0,2.0,He cares a lot about what he does and is very respectful.
817,2679573,5.0,1.0,TAKE THIS CLASS. Ali is a great professor who is passionate about what he teaches! You would have to actually try hard to revive anything other than a 100 in this class. He is interesting to listen to and really cares about his students! Would 100% take again!
818,2679573,5.0,2.0,I took Ali for Art Appreciation and he was an amazing professor. You can tell he loves what he does and he cares about his students. Going to his class soon became one of the highlights of my week. He makes everything so fun and wants nothing but success for all of his students. 10/10 would take again!
819,1221428,2.0,3.0,"He goes off on tangents about the most random things and tries to relate it back to content but it does not make sense. Go to class because attendance is mandatory but when he lectures put airpods in because you won't be able to follow along, just take notes after class. Its more efficient that way because he is boring af. "
820,1221428,4.0,2.0,Dr. Brown was an excellent instructor. His tests were fairly easy
821,1221428,3.0,3.0,He is very boring and his tests usually come from what he says in class and some from notes. All his notes are powerpoint and posted online. He has speakers that come to class every other week. He is really nice though and willing to help if you need it.
822,1221428,1.5,4.0,No Comments
823,2024266,1.0,3.0,"She was super unorganized. I never knew what was going on. I basically taught myself. If you don't know the material already, you'll have trouble understanding and learning and you'll do bad on the tests. You can find all the quizzes on quizlet."
824,2024266,1.0,3.0,"There is a Judy and Judith Moody, so I'm not sure which is her because she goes by both, but by far the worse teacher I have ever had! She does not know how to use technology and forgets in the middle of lectures what she is doing! She needs to retire and has to be here on tenure! Best advice is to buddy up with a classmate when studying! QUIZLET!!"
825,2024266,1.0,4.0,Taking her class was an absolute waste of time. Most assignments were busy work with nothing having any significance. DO NOT take her. She is terrible at explaining her assignments. The amount of work is unnecessary. Beware of asking questions.
826,2024266,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this class with her. She does not explain things at all, and her lectures bore you to tears. She grades everything, so don't just guess. Her class is very hard because of the lack of teaching. If you remember chemistry from high school, you will be fine, if not take with a different person."
827,2024266,1.0,5.0,"Unless you remember everything you learned from chemistry  class, can understand the book assigned,and do everything correctly, you won't pass her class. Take another class instead!!"
828,1221452,5.0,4.0,"Jason Ward is a really great professor. I loved the class, but there are a lot of assigned readings every week. There are quizzes every week, but they're open notes and usually easy. Tests aren't bad because he gives you the essay questions before, but you have to study and prepare for the essays before the test. You definitely have to work for it."
829,1221452,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Ward himself is a good professor and conveys his points clearly and concisely. However, your success in this course is dependent entirely upon how closely your TA follows the grading rubric. As someone who enjoys U.S. History, I wasn't particularly a fan of this fact, because any knowledge I previously had on the subject was deemed irrelevant."
830,1221452,3.0,4.0,"This class is good depending on your TA and how strictly they follow the grading rubric. I passed Accelerated Comp II with an easy A, but the quality of your writing doesn't matter in this class as long as you mention specific words in the rubric. Not a fan."
831,1221452,4.0,3.0,"pros: Very straight to the point in lectures, easy to understand, very knowledgable, plays movie and music clips before class cons: lectures can run long, not a whole lot of notes provided so you have to pay attention, and must go to class to pass the pop quizzes( he usually has 10 over the semester) "
832,1221452,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ward is a great professor! He keeps the class interesting, but you do have to pay attention and write fast. Doing the assigned readings is also very important. I've taken him for several classes and never had a bad one. If you just need a history class for a basic he also teaches the intro classes sometimes."
833,1221452,3.5,3.0,Very fun professor! Uses slides and expects you to write fast. Tests and exams are a lot of writing and include long essay questions. Overall very good teacher.
834,1221452,3.0,3.0,"good teacher make sure you take good notes, the essays on the test suck though."
835,1221452,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher. He is really interesting, plus he's young enough to really relate. Super smart guy that knows his stuff and knows how to make you understand it. Also, one of the most helpful professors I have ever had. Highly recommended."
836,2409294,5.0,3.0,"Cory is a great teacher! I cannot stand science but he was able to make it very enjoyable and interesting. Although I have heard a few students claim he is rude, I never experienced any rude character trait from him. The material is laid out in a somewhat organized manner and the preparation for tests makes it easy to understand what to study."
837,2409294,5.0,3.0,He's a fun lecturer and he loves the material. He does go over a lot in class but he always posted the slides afterward. It was easy for me to understand and I'm normally terrible at science.
838,2409294,5.0,2.0,Plants &amp; Humans is an easy biology class. Copy the notes from the slides &amp; highlight whatever he mentions is a &quot;foot stomp moment.&quot; He's pretty nerdy but acknowledges it in a funny way. You're graded on 4 tests &amp; 10 labs. The final is optional which is really nice. The labs are super short &amp; easy so it's not hard to make an A to boost your grade.
839,2409294,5.0,2.0,"passionate, explains material well"
840,2409294,5.0,3.0,He is a great passionate professor. He really makes an effort to make the material interesting to non science majors. I recommend him. He gives extra credit quizzes that help a lot.
841,2409294,4.0,3.0,"Very passionate about biology and tries to be funny (sometimes is, sometimes isnt). Tries to make a boring subject interesting and understands that you might find it boring. You need to take notes &amp; study, but its pretty straightforward from there."
842,2409294,1.0,4.0,"Did not like this teacher at all... very difficult class, he made it much more difficult than the other Biology I teachers. I emailed him about my grade at the end of the semester and he never emailed me back. Hated the class and didnt like the teacher much more."
843,2409294,1.0,5.0,He is a very difficult teacher. He does not give study guides EVER. He does not respond to emails fast. The TA is awful also. DO NOT TAKE
844,2409294,3.0,4.0,"Very nice guy and is willing to talk to you about your tests and grades. A few extra credit quizzes are given a few days before the test. Reads off of a powerpoint, very passionate but just isn't for everyone."
845,2409294,4.0,4.0,"This class was not bad at all. He was very passionate about what he was teaching. He did move fast through the slides, but he put all of the powerpoints online. The pop quizzes he gave were for extra credit, which really helped. If you just study the powerpoints and put it a little effort, it is an easy class to make an A or B in."
846,2409294,1.0,5.0,Gave harder tests than any other professor and tested on way more material. He also reads directly off the slides and goes way too fast so I end up doing it all on my own time. No study guides or extra credit opportunities. Do not take him.
847,2409294,1.0,5.0,He is rude when you meet with him and reads directly off of his powerpoint slides. The tests are much harder than what he talks about in class. Definitely dont take him!
848,2409294,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher, very passionate and knowledgeable about not just plants, but most everything. Lectures are entertaining. Posts slides online. If you just pay attention and study an adequate amount, you'll be fine."
849,2409294,1.0,5.0,Only lectures. No grades besides the main exams and two extra credit quizzes. Very hard to pay attention in his class bc he goes so fast and its almost impossible to write thorough notes. I just have to start studying the PowerPoints a week before the exam in order to make a good grade. Dont buy the textbook bc you wont use it
850,2409294,2.0,3.0,He is a very nice guy but his test are kinda hard. He also does teach a little fast but its a personal preference honestly
851,2409294,1.0,5.0,"This teacher is terrible. He assigns 6+ chapters on each test and teaches entirely too fast. He also does not take attendance, yet gives pop quizzes every single time he expects people to not be at class. For example, right before a break or before and after test days. I would highly not recommend taking this class with this teacher."
852,1180526,5.0,3.0,"She is absolutly the BEST instructor that there ever was, and trust me I have had quite a few. She is amazing and will help you understand the material at all costs. She is extreamly smart and cute too. She is more than willing to go out of her way to help students. I would and do reccommend her and everyone loves her :)"
853,1180526,2.0,3.0,The worst math teacher i have ever had. Doesn't understand the information she is teaching. If you only want to learn from your homework then take her because she is unclear. Avoid her!!!!!!
854,1180526,2.0,3.0,"Terrible teacher,avoid at all costs"
855,1180526,4.5,2.0,"She's cute,young,funny, and just when you think its getting boring she'll do something totally random thats draws your attention. I HATE math but she caused me to enjoy going to math class. She also takes the time for us to socialize as a class. A+ for Ms. Misty"
856,1180526,4.5,2.0,Great teacher! I actually looked forward to going to her class.
857,1180526,4.0,2.0,She is a very sweet teacher and wants to help you learn but is just not sure how to teach the material.
858,1180526,2.5,2.0,"She is still a grad student and she definitely knows the material, but she isn't exactly the best at delivering the material to be learned. Not to mention, she is a little spastic, in that if she hears a slightest noise.. she stops and investigates it.. kinda weird.."
859,1327983,5.0,1.0,"Love Dr. Collier! Nice, smart, helpful professor!"
860,1327983,5.0,1.0,"Extremely easy. All slides are posted on line. All homework is on owl. All tests come from the slides. If you do not do well in this class you are obviously not trying. Collier is cheerful and jokes. Uses a thinkpad, which is kind of cool. Has plenty of study sessions. Didn't study. Got an A. Grades are curved."
861,1327983,4.5,2.0,"Dr.Collier is a very nice guy, if you take the time to get to know him. It helps to stop by and have a talk with him and get to know him. He is also by far one of my favorite Chem teachers. He is very good at explaining everything. His tests are fair and cover most of what was discussed in class. The Final is stupid hard but he curves it a ton."
862,1327983,4.0,4.0,"His class was hard, but a B is easy to make if you attend class.  The test did not really correspond with the notes, but there was normally a curve.  Some of the stuff on the final I had never seen before.  You can print his notes off which is good.  Also, there is an insane amount of pointless homework."
863,1327983,1.5,4.0,"This class is important, and this professor is pretty much useless. He rambles in class and assigns absurd amounts of online work. He generally replaces your  average with your grade on his final, which is a terrible idea. This class is hard, not because of the material but rather because of the amount of work he assigns for so little taught."
864,1327983,2.0,4.0,"He is there for the research facilities, not to teach. He tells too many jokes and doesn't explain concepts well.Everyone I know in the class has to learn on their own. Going to class is a waste of time but he takes attendance so you have to go. I would strongly suggest looking at a different professor unless you like to put in a lot of study time."
865,1327983,4.0,2.0,"I enjoyed his class very much. He taught from the slides for the most part but I thought his tests were very easy if you studied and went to class. I never studied except a couple hours before class and on every test except 1 made As, and an A on the final exam. I'm not a genius either, plenty of partying and normal college stuff with 17 hours."
866,1327983,3.5,3.0,"He teaches off of slides and flies through the course material really quick. He doesn't spend much time really explaining things you don't understand and makes little effort to go into detail about it. The final was easy, but his other tests were tricky. You don't use the book much."
867,1327983,4.0,1.0,I didn't like him or the class very much at first but now I sit in the front and i enjoy it a lot more.  Yeah his jokes are kinda stupid but it doesnt mean he sucks as a teacher.  I don't know why so many of you are complaining it's a pretty easy class the tests barely need studying for.  Collier explains things well and i never have trouble w/him.
868,1327983,2.0,5.0,"I failed miserably with studying my butt off, he doesnt really explain things very well."
869,1327983,2.0,4.0,Would be a good teacher if you love Chemistry. He moves way to fast and can't really explain something. He just repeats his answer in a different way. Everytime I went for help he just said I didn't try hard enough.
870,1327983,3.0,3.0,"Seems like a nice guy but cracks awful jokes, goes way too fast and during test likes to only give the 30 second warning."
871,1327983,3.0,3.0,No Comments
872,1327983,1.5,4.0,Knows his stuff but works WAY too fast and doesn't explain things well. Throws information at you and expects you to understand. His stupid jokes don't make up for his crappy teaching. Tricky with tests.
873,1327983,2.0,3.0,"Nice guy, like to crack corny jokes in class alot. Don't bother going to him between classes, I went multiple times and he just told me he was too busy. From what I've heard about the other chem teachers, he's the &quot;best.&quot;"
874,2376563,2.0,1.0,"I think that he is probably a good professor in a normal setting. However, I took him for Quest II, which is the honors course; and coming from an amazing professor for Quest I, couldn&#39;t stand him. He claims its an open dialogue, but in reality, its completely about whether or not you agree with him. Easy A if you show up, but frustrating"
875,2376563,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Neal is one of the best professors at MSU. His classes cover lots of topics and he does a great job of giving pertinent background before beginning discussions. If you want a class with interesting conversations about great topics, he is one of the best professors at MSU to take. Just make sure do the reading to get the most out of his class."
876,2376563,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Neal is one of the best professors you can take at MSU. The lectures/discussions are always very interesting and engaging. Don't expect an easy A, you have to do the reading and put in the work, but if you do it's very rewarding"
877,2376563,5.0,3.0,"I enjoyed African American Philosophy with Dr. Neal. He was very encouraging, helpful, and gave AMAZING/intellectual lectures. Very minimal class with 4 1 page reflections and 1 10 page paper at the end. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in the subject, but not to anyone just looking for a philosophy credit. Lots of open discussion!"
878,2638713,5.0,3.0,"This professor has high standards and hold you to them. Read, do the work and show up. Dont rely on Canvas TO DO, instead check his syllabus often to be sure you are in track, its just that easy. He cares that you learn and are able to apply concepts to your life and work. Tip - make sure to see the examples he provides, theyre invaluable."
879,2638713,5.0,3.0,"READ HIS SYLLABUS* - it will be your guide. Refer to it often. Mel makes you work, no doubt about it, but its all applicable. I actually came to enjoy the class after a while :) Attend class and participate, youll pass. Follow his instructions online (*), dont rely on Canvas To Do as a crutch. Read the SYLLABUS and his examples and ur Golden."
880,2638713,2.0,4.0,"He makes his class discussion based and relies heavily on students to lead that discussion. Basically if students dont talk, neither does he. He grades heavily on participation and his definition of that is very subjective, so make sure you know what youre talking about or he will make an embarrasing example out of you. I learned nothing from him."
881,869242,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Smith is the best. You don't need the textbook. Every day he lectures, and you take essay quizzes online every two weeks based on the lectures. He only has 2 exams, but are also online. Super easy, and super sweet guy. Would 100% recommend him to a friend."
882,869242,4.0,1.0,"Dr. Smith was a good teacher for Intro to Mass Media. Just make to sure to take notes and study for the tests and this class is an easy A. The only reason I got a B is because I was unable to make up one of the exams. Tries to be hip and cool sometimes, but overall would recommend taking him."
883,869242,4.0,2.0,"Mr. Smith is literally awesome. I would say that his lectures are beneficial to attend, because he can drop hints for tests. As long as you study what he says to study for the test, you will pass his test. The only reason you wouldn't pass his test, is if you flat out didn't study. So overall highly recommend him."
884,869242,2.0,2.0,very monotone and doesn't answer questions clearly. It's an easy class but sometimes hard to pay attention because he doesn't make it interesting
885,869242,3.0,1.0,Class itself is easy. 4 sections so 4 quizzes and 4 tests and also a paper at the end of the 3rd section. He goes off on a deep long lecture on something and hes passionate but its boring. You get 5 abcenses before it hurts your grade. Overall not a bad teacher just boring lecture.
886,869242,4.0,2.0,"Dr Smith is a real solid teacher. I took him for Intro to Mass Media and it wasnt exceptionally hard. You can do well if you pay attention and review the slides he posts. His tests arent bad if you go to class. Dr Smith himself is a really good guy. Sometimes he tries to project himself as &quot;hip&quot;, but its really more funny than anything. Good Guy."
887,869242,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Smith for Intro. to Mass Media. It wasn't a bad class at all, just a little boring. You don't have to buy a book. He allows 5 unexcused absences before it hurts your grade so that's pretty good. He is pretty funny and helpful. He gives good study guides and posts all his powerpoints online."
888,869242,5.0,3.0,"Really cool guy, with great stories. Just do not laugh at his disabilities."
889,869242,1.0,1.0,"Not a good teacher. Very full of himself. Could tell that lectures were prepared a long time ago. Very out of date and not relevant. Tried too hard to be ""cool""."
890,869242,1.0,2.0,Bad teacher all around.
891,869242,3.0,1.0,"Dr. Smith's class is incredibly easy and somewhat entertaining. And you don't need a book! Bonus. Dr. Smith himself got on my nerves though. I got the sense he wanted the crowd to think he was cool, and he uses a lot of tech jargon without any idea of what any of it means. A classmate headdesked after a lengthy speech about why he chose an SSD."
892,869242,2.5,2.0,"His few quizzes and tests are pretty easy. The tests require a lot of studying, but if you put in the effort for each test and pay attention in class, you'll come out with an A. The class itself is really boring. He will call people out who leave early or randomly call on people to answer questions that no one knows the answer to."
893,869242,5.0,2.0,"While he often goes off on soap box tangents in class, overall, he's a good teacher and he knows his stuff. When he's actually teaching, he can make stuff pretty interesting (even to a noncommunication major). The tests and quizzes can be a little hard but not if you go to class. I enjoyed his class and I would recommend him."
894,869242,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Smith is a wonderful teacher, he's engaging and his superior knowledge of the subject is obvious."
895,869242,5.0,3.0,pete is a really cool guy one of the most intelligent in the communication department
896,869242,5.0,2.0,Pete is a bad ass teacher. He understand his students and he understands the material. Very approachable and has a good sense of humor.
897,869242,4.0,3.0,Very Interesting. He is a very nice teacher and I really enjoyed his class! Would def. recommend this class.
898,869242,4.5,2.0,He was a great teacher and knows what he is talking about. Classes were very entertaining especially the last couple of weeks when we watched movie clips. Study guides give the test away.

901,869242,4.0,2.0,Pete was a fun teacher because we talked about issues that we were interested in.
902,869242,5.0,2.0,makes learning fun
903,869242,4.0,3.0,"Lots of material, but makes the class fun as possible."
904,869242,5.0,2.0,"Pete is awesome! He's really interesting, helpful and has lots of experience with what he's talking about."

906,869242,5.0,1.0,"Great prof.  Makes the class very interesting. Tests are easy since the test material is on the study guides.  However, learn to keep your mouth shut otherwise he'll jump all over you and point you out to the class."
907,869242,5.0,2.0,Dr. Smith is a great professor.
908,869242,5.0,1.0,No Comments
909,2417546,4.0,4.0,"She is very sweet and super soft spoken, so be sure and sit close to the front. If you have a solid foundation of trig you will do very well in the class. One thing I dont love is that she doesnt always answer questions well and things could be done simpler so be sure to refer to the worked notes posted on cavas. Overall, very decent."
910,2417546,1.0,5.0,"I strongly encourage you to take someone else unless you like work assignments piled up back to back, and tests that dont add up to what you learn in class, also be prepared to watch her do three problems and dismiss class on webex. and the three problems shell do wont have anything to do with your homework. Tests are hard too on honorlock."
911,2417546,1.0,5.0,Do not take her if you want to do well in Trig.  If you see her on your schedule drop the class immediately.  She teaches for 10 mins with 2 problems then perceives to give homework on stuff you have never seen.  If you come to her with a question she does not understand what you are asking or tells you to refer to video lecture for help.
912,2417546,2.0,4.0,"She is very quiet and is very hard to understand. If you cannot understand accents well, I do not recommend her. She also likes to teach the more complicated way of doing problems."
913,1213329,5.0,4.0,"Dr. M is one of the most intelligent and knowledgeable people that I have ever met. He is also an excellent teacher. If you want to improve your french, take his classes. I intend to take every class that he offers."
914,1213329,5.0,4.0,"Dr. M is a passionate educator who truly loves teaching French.  His class was not easy, but I feel prepared for the next level.  He is really good at what he does."
915,1213329,5.0,4.0,"I don't know how Dr. M is not teaching at an Ivy League school, but I am glad that he is at MSU. He is incredibly knowledgeable and hilarious."
916,1213329,5.0,4.0,"Mississippi State is very lucky to have Dr.M.  He is a gifted professor that is passionate about teaching.  Additionally, it is obvious that he is a tremendous researcher.  His extensive knowledge base is sometimes difficult to believe.  He is able to engage students and to make interdisciplinary connections."
917,1213329,5.0,4.0,"This is the best French teacher in the department.  It is clear that he is passionate about the language.  He encourages the students to participate in class, and he makes everyone feel comfortable.  I have learned so much.  He also takes the time to read our papers and tests and writes thorough comments so that we can improve."
918,1213329,5.0,4.0,"Dr. M is an engaging professor.  He is not an easy professor but you will learn more than you have ever learned.  If you attend class, you will make a good grade.  His criteria for success are clear."
919,1213329,5.0,4.0,"Dr. M is challenging, but I have never learned so much in my life.  He is so well-prepared and he has a great system.  I was overwhelmed at first, but I now feel prepared to study French anywhere."
920,1213336,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Barnett was a great instructor for Principles of Management online. Very organized class and not difficult. You definitely work for your grade, but if you complete assignments and study for the midterm and final, which are weighted the most, then you should have no problem in this class."
921,1213336,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Barnett's online course was the most organized online course I have taken. As long as you stay on-task with weekly assignments, you should do well. Don't get behind. You'll work for your grade. Not too difficult, but you'll feel like you've earned what you get. Fabulous teacher &amp; a good man. Really cares about the subject &amp; is helpful students."
922,1213336,3.5,4.0,Very helpful if you have questions.  I suspect sitting in his class would be easier than listen to him lecture online.  I would not recommend Barnett for an online instructor.  one of the books we utilized kept falling apart on me.  makes studying difficult when the pages are falling out.
923,1213336,5.0,2.0,"Very nice, helpful, genuine, humble. Appreciate his being in McCool."

925,1942425,4.0,3.0,"Online class, uses Honorlock for 3 major tests. The tests have a lot of weight. Once you know how to study for the tests, they're pretty easy. Professor is friendly, helpful and wants you to succeed. Great class and great professor."
926,2786205,5.0,2.0,Hands down one of the best professors at Mississippi State. She really cares about her students!
927,2786205,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Gallo is INCREDIBLE!!! Literally one of the kindest professors at MSU, she will make you want to come to class, and you'll leave feeling like a rockstar every day. She makes the material really understandable and is truly a joy to learn from! You won't regret taking her for anything, everyone loves Dr. Gallo!!!"
928,2048927,2.0,3.0,"I believe that he had the best intentions when he was teaching us. However, I felt like the class did not prepare me for Business Stats 2. Class was cancelled very often, although at first this is very appealing, later on I felt like I was teaching myself more than I was learning from him. A good is that he does let you have an entire cheat sheet."
929,2048927,5.0,1.0,Great professor! Lectures are great if you interact with him to get things moving along. This class consist of online homework and 3 &quot;midterms&quot; including the final. You are allowed cheatsheets and a calculator. Easy A! there is also a bonus activity that is offered.
930,2048927,1.0,2.0,"Tough to get through the heavy accent right off the bad. He gives ZERO extra credit and NO free absences. If you dont show up, your average goes down, so attendance is 100% mandatory. He repeats himself on things that everyone understands, and picks on people who ask clarifying questions. I will not take his classes again."
931,2048927,1.0,1.0,"Many reasons why I wouldn't take this teacher again. Worst teacher : Hard to understand due to language barrier Tough grader and does NOT round (if you have a 79.6, you'll need to receive a 79.9 in order for him to round) Attendance counts towards grade If are not a good self learner and don't understand how he speaks, its going to be tough."
932,2048927,4.0,1.0,His accent can be hard to understand but also very funny. Lecture sucks. He repeats himself over and over until someone answers. Posts notes online. Exams have a cheat sheet. Almost everyone made a 100 on the first exam. Examples and notes are very clear. Homework every week but not bad at all. Don't need to go to class to pass.
933,2048927,3.0,4.0,"I liked Dr. Wang, but the problem which I heard about before taking the class is that you will have a high A going into the final and then the final is incredibly hard -- nothing like the other 2 tests. I had a 98 going into the final and made a 60 on the final and got a B out of the class. I was definitely disappointed."
934,2048927,5.0,2.0,"Professor Wang was definitely one of the more caring professors at State, and you'll get a laugh from his humor & accent too! Overall, the class was homework and tests, and the homework sometimes takes a while, but as long as you don't shortcut the problems, the tests come pretty easy. The lectures can get boring, but he's always in a great mood!"
935,2048927,4.0,3.0,"Not a fan of the class overall, but if I had to do it again I'd take Dr Wang again.  Any professor willing to put extra time into students like this guy does is worth taking. If you don't get it, you can stay after class or go to office hours and he'll help you, and he's actually good help. Definitely worth taking."
936,2048927,4.5,3.0,"He is an awesome professor! If you need help,He will help you. If you do not understand something he will stay after class to make sure you understand. If you want a teacher who gets to know his students and is willing to help them understand then you should take this professor. Everything he teaches are in his notes, and I recommend him to anyone"
937,2048927,5.0,1.0,"He's a very good professor. He repeats everything (multiple times) to make sure that everyone gets it. If you don't understand something, GO TO HIS OFFICE!! He's willing to spend as much time as you need to go over notes/assignments with you. It's very difficult to fail this class (You won't do well, if you don't do your work)."
938,2048927,2.0,3.0,"If you're able to understand this guy, please let me know because I have yet to genuinely understand any topic because of how he talks. Some people can deal with that, but I just can't learn when the information is presented like this."
939,2048927,4.0,3.0,He'll do anything he can to help a student!
940,2048927,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Wang, excellent teacher! Wants everyone to pass, stays after class, email, & office hrs daily to help in anyway before tests. Dr. Wang is not hard, but the class itself is. Do not be discouraged, he breaks it down to completely understand through his humorous accent. No online anything. My name is Boyd and I highly recommend him to anybody!!!!!"
941,2048927,5.0,2.0,AWESOME professor!! Genuinely cares about  his students understanding the material. He will not move on until EVERYONE gets it! Very easy formatted tests. Does a great job of preparing students for exactly what he'll be testing.
942,2048927,4.5,3.0,"Overall great professor. If you want an instructor that genuinely cares about his students and tries his best to make the material interesting, Xinchang Wang is your guy. As far as the in class material goes, your grade will depend on homework/attendance/exams. If prepared for, the exams are A'able. The homework can be a little strenuous though."
943,2048927,4.5,2.0,"This class was very helpful and beneficial, he randomly did attendance, but if you have to miss he understands. He's available ALWAYS for help with homework and he's there to clarify anything that's not understood in class."
944,2048927,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher I have ever had. You can't understand a word he says, his homework is literally impossible unless you buy the book answers offline. It does't matter how much you study you will fail the second and the fourth test which is a comprehensive final. Do not ever take this teacher. "
945,2048927,4.0,4.0,"He is tough to understand at times during lectures, but as far as helpfulness he is great. All you have to do if you want to understand something is stay after class and ask him personally. Basically if you are willing to work hard you will get an a or b. If not than good luck passing."
946,2048927,1.0,4.0,"Hard to understand.  Tricks you on the tests by giving you a very easy first test but a lot harder second and third tests.  Homework is a lot of problems from the book, written on paper and turned in in-class. It takes forever to do because he counts off about half the points if you don't show your work and aren't similar to any of the examples."
947,230325,1.5,3.0,"Very disorganized, boring, and decided she was going to make our class a hybrid class without warning anyone. Going to class is a waste of time, you won't learn anything anyway. I recommend taking ENGL 311 with anyone but her."
948,230325,1.0,3.0,"This was her first semester at Ferris State University, and she was absolutely terrible. Very unorganized. Gave strict guidelines for emails, but never used them herself. Didn't inform us that our class was a hybrid class. We did more non-technical writing than technical, in a technical writing class. Do not take this instructor. You'll regret it."
949,230325,4.5,1.0,Great teacher. Loved her topic and wanted you to love it also. I thought she was very organized.
950,230325,4.5,3.0,Would take her again.  Very helpful.
951,230325,1.5,3.0,Terrible time trying to get this professor to contact us. I had to contact other staff at the school to get her in gear. Class ends in two days. 1/2 of material is still ungraded. The worst experience I've had at MSU. We used online book. 3/4 through semester prof indicated no work from that book would count as it was a test of the material. WHAT&#63;!
952,230325,2.0,3.0,Unable to get the professor to respond to emails or online discussions.  This is a problem since this entire course is an online/distance course. I've tried to call her twice and hit the voice mail wall each time.
953,230325,1.0,5.0,does not answer timely. not organized. unknown what her problem is. not recommend this instructor to anyone.
954,230325,2.0,4.0,Her class was hard and she was mean.  I would never take another one of her classes again
955,230325,4.0,3.0,Lots and lots of bussy work. Do not fear her style is changing in order to accomadate the group project and the like.
956,1729470,1.5,1.0,"He was very unorganized. He stresses you out in the beginning. I kinda felt bad for him because he was never prepared.He was a grad student so he really didnt know much about what he was teaching. He got off topic alot and i really did not learn anything in the class! If you just want an easy A, but no learning experience what so ever, TAKE HIM!"
957,1729470,1.0,1.0,"I also took him for EPY 3253. He never gave a definite answer, it was always... ""There is no right answer."" Some how I managed to get decent grades, but the classes were stressful!"
958,2188246,4.0,3.0,"A lot of homework, but it helps balance out exam grades. Quizzes were straightforward, and we had to have conversations through conversifi for speaking assignments. He is a little quiet in class, but going helps you understand the material."
959,2188246,4.0,3.0,Be ready to do homework. Tests can be hard but other assignments help balance your average. Sometimes speaks quiet.
960,2188246,4.0,3.0,Tests can be hard but he does curve and there is a drop grade with quizzes. Lots of homework so keep up.
961,2188246,4.0,3.0,He wasnt the hardest professor. Understands Spanish well which made up for being a little quieter. There are a lot of kids of assignments so you can make a good grade if you do your work.
962,2188246,5.0,4.0,I had a harder time with Spanish in community college and thought I couldn't get Spanish. I felt I learned a lot even though I had to work for it. Study for tests - quizzes and stuff aren't always as hard but the exams are legit challenging.
963,2188246,4.0,4.0,I have a hard time with languages but he helped me understand better. Tests can be hard but they are fair.
964,2188246,4.0,2.0,He explains things well. Pay attention in class. The textbook isnt always perfect but he clarifies the ideas.
965,2188246,4.0,3.0,He's a good teacher. A little shy but he cares. I hope I can get Spanish 3 with him.
966,2188246,5.0,3.0,A little soft spoken but he speaks Spanish well. He loves language.
967,2188246,4.0,1.0,"I took him for Spanish 1 &amp; 2. He is very sweet, but a little disheveled. He speaks Spanish fluently &amp; is passionate about the cultures. Both classes ended up online, but the assignments were online, anyway. The downside was the group projects because students don't care about the class. The exams are easy if you actually paid attention &amp; practiced."
968,2188246,4.0,3.0,There is lot of homework every week. He liked group projects which helped me speak Spanish more.
969,2188246,4.0,2.0,I had a lot of family issues and he was willing to tutor to help me catch up. It took a lot of stress off my shoulders.
970,2188246,4.0,3.0,A lot of grammar!!! I learned a lot though. Tests were fair too.
971,2188246,4.0,4.0,Theres a lot of work but its Spanish. Good class.
972,2188246,5.0,3.0,"McFadden is an overall good teacher. I learned a lot from him, and he is very accessible outside of class. Grades in a fair manner, and makes Spanish easy to learn. Great teacher to take!"
973,2188246,5.0,2.0,He can be monotone but hes patient and a good teacher.
974,2188246,5.0,3.0,He has a good command of the language
975,2188246,4.0,4.0,He is a smart teacher
976,2188246,4.0,3.0,He knows Spanish well
977,2188246,2.0,1.0,"Well. If you do not care about learning, by all means take this class. Don't worry about any of the assignments, he gives everyone the same grade. I completed all homework assignments given and my partner didn't even buy the access code, but guess what, we both received a 95. Grades are merely submitted to pass everyone and class isn't necessary."
978,2188246,2.0,1.0,"Mcfadden is VERY boring. Do not take this class if you are expecting to learn anything. The class is extremely easy because he gives A's to everyone and doesn't count off if you miss an assignment, being said, it sucks when you do spend lots of time on an assignment just to find out he doesn't even look at it."
979,2188246,2.0,1.0,"Well well well where do I begin... Okay, so if you do not care about learning spanish and just need a good grade, by all means take this class. You'll hate every day but you WILL pass. If you want to learn spanish (or need up to Spanish 3) DO NOT take him. He is the most awkward human being in the world. He teaches Spanish 1&amp;2 sometimes 3 in summer"
980,2188246,3.0,1.0,Super easy! But you better get a seat in his Spanish 2 class or you are screwed. Did not learn much. Cancels often. Lots of online homework. Curves tests! Kinda dry. And has the same tone all the time.
981,2188246,3.0,3.0,"Very unorganized. Cancels class a lot. Will not respond to emails or be willing to discuss test grades in his office. Will give those who do not try an A and those who try really hard a B or C. Usually get out of class early. Very boring in class, but classwork can be done in groups. Does not take attendance and is not strict about cellphones."
982,2737115,4.0,2.0,"Shawn was a pretty cool professor, easy to get along with, and sometimes his lectures were interesting. The entire grade was 2 papers that you didn't have to go to class to be able to write. He didn't give great feedback on the papers, and you could tell he was reading them too fast to really pay attention to them, but he tried at least."
983,2737115,5.0,2.0,The only grades for the class are 2 essays. He grades very fairly and gives you the opportunity to rewrite the first essay for a better grade. The class was a little boring but he was very passionate about the material and really cares about his students. If you need to take intro to philosophy I would definitely take it with him!
984,2737115,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Simpson cares about philosophy and his students, but if you do not enjoy learning about philosophy, I would not take this class. I heard that this class was an easy A, but that was not true. This class is an easy B due to how hard he grades his papers. If you are good at writing philosophy papers, this is the class for you. "
985,2737115,3.0,1.0,"Prof. Simpson is a really nice person, and tries to help students understand complex ideas. The best way to understand the material is by going to class, but attendance was not mandatory (he may have just changed this). He gives good feedback on the two papers you write and generally will try to help any student that asks. Graded fairly and easyily"
986,2737115,5.0,1.0,I took him for Intro to Philosophy and his class was fairly easy. You do two papers and then attendance is 5% of your grade. He grades pretty leniently on both papers and you are allowed to submit rough drafts. All he really asks is that you show up and participate. Hell make sure you get a good passing grade if you work with him.
987,2737115,1.0,3.0,"He was a good professor, but his class was extremely boring. I probably would not take his class again. Each paper you write is 45% of your grade (2papers) and attendance is 10%. This class was very boring and I found myself dreading going to class. He was a good person who cared for his students, but not the class type for me."
988,2737115,5.0,1.0,"The only assignments in the entire course are two papers, and he will let you rewrite the first one for a better grade. He gives a lot of readings but he teaches everything you need to know about them in class. He makes the concepts easy to understand and will answer any questions you have. Very cool professor, take him if you can!"
989,2032627,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Kraker is amazing! If you really want to learn Spanish, take her class! She is so kind and helpful, and she is very passionate about the Spanish language. I have had the best experience having her as my professor!"
990,2032627,5.0,2.0,I would recommend this teacher to anyone! She is amazing and really cares for her students. She is always willing to help and she gives back points. She makes learning Spanish very enjoyable!
991,2032627,5.0,3.0,"I&#39;m now in Spanish 2 w/ Sra. Kraker because of how great she was in Spanish 1! U HAVE to go to class but if u do, u get a free 100 almost every class. Conversifis are completion which is better than oral quizzes in class. She talks in Spanish (obviously) but if she can tell we are confused, she will say it in English."
992,2032627,5.0,4.0,"Lots of HW due every t/tr and quizzes/ assignments due in class that require a code so if you dont go to class youll get zeroes. if you go to class its an easy A if you dont , you wont do well"
993,2032627,1.0,5.0,"By far the hardest class I've ever taken. She teaches 100% in Spanish. If you ask her for help she'll just say &quot;you need to study more&quot;. For the final, she gave us a 14 page study guide to fill out and then didn't give us the answers until 3 days before we took the final. You'd be better off taking French or by taking another professor for FLS."
994,2032627,4.0,4.0,"There is lots of quizzes and homework. You have to study a lot outside of class but other than that, I learned a lot in this class and she is far easier to understand than my other spanish teachers. If you have to take all the way up to spanish 3+, I would definitely take her because I was very prepared."
995,2032627,5.0,1.0,"I love Mrs. Kraker as a professor. And to clear things up, she does NOT talk 100% in Spanish during lectures, and if she can tell that we don't understand what she's saying, she will repeat in English. Lotsss of group work, and a decent amount of homework, but a fair grader."
996,2032627,4.0,3.0,"Expects you to know the basics, but overall pretty great."
997,2032627,5.0,3.0,"Shes a great professor! Shes very helpful, and the online hw 3 days a week actually helps. Tests and quizzes are easy enough if youre listening and paying attention. She teaches the class mostly in Spanish, but she breaks it down &amp; makes it easier to understand. Shes very understanding and grades fairly. She loves doing group work so beware."
998,2032627,4.0,4.0,"If you're looking for an easy A, don't take Ms. Kraker. If you'd actually like to learn Spanish, you'll find that she is a great teacher. You will have lots of homework, and cramming for one of her tests is a bad idea. She does speak Spanish for the most part, but she translates if you don't understand. I'm taking her for Spanish II, as well!"
999,2032627,2.0,3.0,"She only talks in Spanish in class, and I could not learn a language by having it taught to me in that language. Most of her class is &quot;talking to each other,&quot; then she crams the lesson in the last 5-10min. Her excuse for everything is her kids. You will be kept overtime everyday."
1000,2032627,1.0,5.0,"Homework isn't bad. Must go to, and pay attention in class. If you have no background in Spanish do not even take Spanish 1 from her. She told us she would not teach the class fully in Spanish, and then the day after the last day to drop without a W, she spoke nothing but Spanish."
1001,2032627,5.0,3.0,"Homework every night, but would be the same with any professor. Ms. K cares about every student and will do anything to help you if you try. She's so nice and such a great teacher. She speaks mainly in spanish in class but that helped me learn it a lot quicker! if you don't understand, she will translate lol. She's great!"
1002,2032627,5.0,4.0,I did not have a solid back ground in Spanish. I struggled a lot in this class. I really tried my best and received a low C! But I learned a lot. I probably know more than an A/B student in a different class. If you want to learn take her but if you just want a good grade don't.
1003,2032627,5.0,2.0,"Amazing teacher. Had her for Spanish 1 and 2. Test and quizzes are easy if you study. If you have no Spanish background, you may struggle/have to study a little more. She really cares and wants you to learn."
1004,2032627,5.0,1.0,"She is a great teacher, and is always willing to help! This class will be hard if you have no background in Spanish, but other than that she makes class understandable which makes it easy! I would take her class again! "
1005,2491399,5.0,4.0,I had Dr. Poe for intro to news writing and reporting and the only bad thing I can say about it is I wish it was in person to get to know him more. He knows his stuff so don't think you'll be able to get by with mediocre work. News and AP quizzes will affect your grade a lot so be sure to get good grades on those. News stories count the most though
1006,2188307,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Pierce is probably the best physics 1 teacher in the department. If you pay attention, understand the concepts, and do the homework you'll be fine"
1007,2188307,5.0,4.0,"(In Physics) Dr. Pierce is wonderful! She cares about her students and works hard to explain each and every concept in an effective, understandable manner. I was so afraid to take physics, but she made it seem easy! She doesnt post notes, so definitely go to class, but her tests will be from the notes &amp; homework problems so practice them!"
1008,2188307,4.0,3.0,GREAT at explaining concepts. Works through practice problems slowly and methodically. Would recommend.
1009,2188307,2.0,4.0,"I took her for Astronomy. She is very nice and passionate about the course, but is a very difficult teacher. She is super smart, but for people like me who know nothing about any type of science, it was quite hard to keep up. One tip is to never skip her class. When I missed one class, I felt very behind on the material."
1010,2188307,3.0,5.0,"She does not post worked notes online, so you HAVE to go to class. When studying for tests, don't worry about the MP homework. Just study in class problems. She makes those up and also makes up her tests so they're similar. Difficult class. Tests are 4 questions, 25 pts each. She's accessible out of class and willing to help you if you need it."
1011,1991701,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Witt is a good lecturer. He cares a lot about the subject and he wants the student to learn. However he talks so fast I could barely understand him the whole semester. I had to rewatch almost all of the lectures. Also there is a lot of essays and reading assignments so you will need the book. Overall, though it is an interesting class."
1012,1991701,5.0,1.0,"TAKE HIM. Dr. Witt is absolutely amazing, knowledgeable, and interesting. His class was one of my favorites simply because of the way he presented information. Never pushed information but always knew so much to give a good answer if asked. He went over the textbook well so it was not needed for class. No final exam, just a reflection paper. Love."
1013,1991701,4.0,4.0,I took him for two religion classes and loved him. His lecture really depends on people doing the readings and participating in discussion. If you dont want to read and talk I wouldnt take but hes a super nice professor.
1014,1991701,5.0,1.0,This intro to Religion class is not the usual. I learned so much in this class just by showing up. You can miss up to 5 classes but I didn't miss that much. If you just listen to him talk you will retain the information. You have 5 homework's and they are very easy. Read a story and answer a question or two. He goes over every test as well.
1015,1991701,3.5,4.0,"Really cool dude and a great teacher, but this is probably the only religion class at MSU that is not a joke.  I had to work hard and study for an A and my friend (who was in a religion class taught by someone else) got and easy A by showing up.  If you are actually interested in learning about religion, I would recommend.  Otherwise, do not take."
1016,2352153,3.0,2.0,Really excited and loud (even at 8am). Allows up to 3 absences. Lots of homework but really easy. Test are kinda hard but just study the starred slides and you'll do fine. Really easy A.
1017,2352153,2.0,2.0,"Kelly is very loud and has A LOT of energy. If you attend lecture and asnwer questions, she will give you extra credit. The class itself and material is easy, all using Microsoft word and power point,. The hardest thing is sitting through lecture and the exams."
1018,2417703,2.0,1.0,"We literally graded our classmate's work for most of the semester, she didn't grade at all. When it came time for the final project the instructions were not clear and her TA was the one who graded it. Luckily I made an A but the final project was a lot of work for her to not even look at it."
1019,2417703,5.0,1.0,"This class is a great introduction to biological/biomedical engineering! You get to hear from a lot of guest speakers and you work on a final group project at the end of the course. Surprisingly, this course worked out really well online (due to COVID), especially considering that it is an engineering course."
1020,2417703,4.0,1.0,This class is an easy pass. All you do is work with Word and Excell. Just read the directions on the assignment and you'll make an A.
1021,132136,4.0,3.0,"Took VIA zoom in spring 2021. Pay attention and participate during lectures, and you'll go far. Lots of reading with two short + reading logs per week, three essays but he offers feedback if you turn in a draft before due date. This will sound weird, but midterm and final were actually kind of fun! As long as you put in the work, you'll be fine."
1022,132136,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Little took somewhat (or entirely) boring literature and helped me engage with it more. You will read a lot, and you should show up to class if youre not use to analyzing literature and if you want to hear the assignments. You have to read the books for papers and tests, but other than that, we had fun in class and I learned some stuff."
1023,132136,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Little is a really funny guy, I enjoyed his class and I didnt think his lectures were that bad. Hes a hard grader on papers and you have to read the books to do well on his test, but overall i enjoyed his class."
1024,132136,1.5,3.0,"Reading assignments were given for every class, and quizzes were given on them. They were normally only five questions, but not very easy. The reading were normally too long especially considering we have other classes. Papers topics were weird and difficult. Tests were fill in the blank,and had a weird layout. He was not helpful at all."
1025,132136,3.5,4.0,CONTENT WAS BORING BUT HE'S PRETTY COOL AND HILARIOUS.
1026,132136,2.5,4.0,He talks alot.  He doesn't say whats going to be on the test.  You have to read out your butt.  But he's funny.
1027,132136,1.5,1.0,"Quite frankly I'm not the guy knows what he is talking about. This is the only lit class that I have been completely bored to tears in, if you have any knowledge and appreciation for the art of literature you will stay as far away from this course as you can."
1028,2352207,4.0,4.0,Dr. Ezell is a great teacher. Hes soft spoken and at times a bit awkward. But whats not to love about that. Hes a brilliant guy and truly cares about making sure we understand the material. Never be afraid to go to him personally if you need help
1029,2466901,4.0,2.0,Really knows his stuff and it shows. Funny guy that makes the class fun to be a part of. ALL of your grade is based solely on your tests. Tests are thought provoking. A few definition type questions then complete scenario based. Makes you really think about the &quot;problem&quot; to give your solution. 100% recommend him for anything.
1030,2466901,5.0,3.0,"Dr. French is caring, enthusiastic, down-to-earth, and interesting. He makes class enjoyable, but always tells things straight up. He is passionate about his job and loves his students. Sometimes you have to ask questions to redirect his explanations, he frequently tends to focus on some of the excess details, but nonetheless is a great professor."
1031,2466901,5.0,2.0,Very caring and soft spoken individual. Dont be scared to answer questions.
1032,1336428,5.0,2.0,"James Thompson is a funny teacher, and I found his class to be entertaining with quality lessons (if you ask questions). The logic course was nearly the easiest of my classes. Just do the homework and you will get a 90% or better. In order to succeed, avoid the mouth breathers and smooth brains."
1033,1336428,4.0,3.0,"He was a very good professor! The class was kind of hard at first, but he is very good at teaching the material. He will even push the exams back when he sees that his students are struggling. He also goes over the homework in class to help (homework is also for completion grade). He really cares about his student's grades and does lots to help!"
1034,1336428,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Thompson was a great professor. He takes attendance the first few weeks, but it's not mandatory and has no direct effect on your grade. His lectures can be boring or confusing it just depends on the type of learner you are. Everything was online and the book was not used at all, the only thing you need is the online access."
1035,1336428,4.5,5.0,"His Intro to Logic class was literally the hardest philosophy class I have ever taken. He went through the chapters so fast and didn't spend a lot of time making sure everyone knew the material. He was available for help outside of class, but there are easier profs for this class. Don't take."
1036,1336428,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, I enjoyed every moment of it. He uses alot of examples and if you have trouble with anything he will help"
1037,1336428,4.5,2.0,No Comments
1038,2352242,5.0,3.0,"The textbook is absolutely detrimental to succeeding in the online class. She provides recorded lectures of overview powerpoints, but her homework assignments and reviews rely on textbook reading. Some chapters are rather long, but the information needed to do well is rather easy to comprehend."
1039,2352242,4.0,2.0,She cares about her students and is very helpful. I enjoyed coming to class and didn't wake up dreading it. She is very reliant on the textbook so as long as you follow the textbook throughout the semester you will have a good grade.
1040,2352242,4.0,3.0,Tami cares about her students and is a good professor. I would take a class with her again.
1041,2352242,4.0,4.0,Great teacher
1042,2352242,5.0,2.0,"I loved taking Mrs. Metz for PMM. The material can be a little boring at times, but she always communicated it in an effective and easy way. I took this class to learn better financial skills, and I learned that within the first month with a tracking assignment. I highly recommend her! She really cares about each individual student and our success."
1043,2352242,4.0,2.0,"Super sweet lady, the class can be boring at times but overall I learned a lot! Don't assume that you don't have to study for the tests, though. She throws in a lot of definitions and such that you really need to have gone over! Gave 1 open-book test and gives participation points."
1044,2352242,5.0,1.0,Mrs. Metz is one of the best instructors at State.
1045,2352242,3.0,3.0,She is very nice and cares about her student's future. Her lectures are pretty boring and she repeats herself a lot. Her tests are fair as long as you read the book.
1046,550022,5.0,4.0,"Iida-sensei is a great teacher and person. Although there is homework and a quiz most every class, the workload isn't unbearable, and she lets you earn back half the points you miss on tests. She's always enthusiastic in her teaching and often  gives insights into Japanese culture as well as teaching the language in a clearly comprehensible format."
1047,550022,5.0,4.0,"Iida-sensei is fantastic. She's willing to answer any questions you have during or outside of class and lets you correct tests to get half your missed points back. There is a vocab quiz almost every class meeting, so be prepared to study a lot and attend every class."
1048,550022,4.5,2.0,"Had her for two years.A very dedicated and passionate teacher who cares about how her students do.Always enthusiastic, never misses class.MUST attend class often to do well. She gives many quizzes and quite a few test. Material is tough and is fast paced.She lets you retake test many times until your grade improves so I gave it four stars for easy."
1049,550022,4.5,4.0,"I looove Iida-sensei!  She is an amazing teacher.  She drills you really hard but it's worth it to me because I have learned so much.  Also she makes you sing ridiculous songs, but they stick in your head.  Definitely take Japanese, it's amazing."
1050,550022,3.5,1.0,Iida sensei is a very good teacher; I've had her for 3 years straight and she's really great!! Take this instead of Spanish; it'll definitely look better on your resume...
1051,550022,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher. She's Japanese so she has an accent when she speaks English. She is very understandable though. She's hilarious and entertaining. This is the hardest language class that I have taken. It takes a lot of outside work, but it's not hard. Iida-sensee is easily one of my favorite professors."
1052,550022,3.5,2.0,I love her. She's awesome. She's really helpful and absolutely hilarious. Not a class goes by without her tripping me out. simply awesome!
1053,1655943,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic teacher. He is really enthusiastic about the things he makes you read. He grades major essays pretty tough, but as long as you read the stories and take notes when he goes over them, you'll do great."
1054,2319524,1.0,3.0,"Boring lectures. Go to your TA class period though, they are the ones that grade everything. James Hill has the most monotone voice I've ever heard. He will literally tell you &quot;if you HAVE to miss, then miss my lectures not the TA sessions&quot;. **DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK**"
1055,2319524,1.0,4.0,"Terrible professor. Does not care about you as a person, and the test that were graded by the TA's which were not any better than Dr. Hill. The TA's were not any help if you were struggling and trying really hard to understand the material. Went to my TA multiple times for extra help and was not given that."
1056,2319524,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Hill was a solid overall teacher. We had a class of 400 in Old Main, so he doesn't directly talk to you during lectures. Attendance is not mandatory, but I recommend going to a good amount of them. Discussion is mandatory and helps for reviewing. Do your assignments, and make your study guide a few days in advance. Recommend him for sure."
1057,2319524,3.0,4.0,My ta graded hard and I had trouble getting an A but Dr Hill was good. He goes kinda fast during his lecture so get ready to abbreviate your notes. He does put his notes online though. Dont make him mad though. My entire class got punished for a group of kids that got caught cheating.
1058,2319524,5.0,2.0,"Hill is a great prof. He posts slides and is a fair grader. As long as you follow along with the material, studying for finals is not difficult. Would definitely recommend for an elective class."
1059,2319524,3.0,1.0,"Dr. Hill is a very good orator. His notes are easy to comprehend and his lectures can sometimes make history entertaining (again-sometimes). This all being said, the grading system he employs is, for many, not fair. Your grades are at the mercy of the TA, and few are going to go easy on you."
1060,2319524,5.0,3.0,"Be ready to write, a lot. If you're a bad writer (essays and short answer only tests in under 50 minutes) get help from the Writing center. Other than that, so long as you actually pay attention in class you will pass the test. Show up to lecture and your discussion section and it should be an easy A so long as you pay attention to the lecture."
1061,2319524,3.0,3.0,"He is very good at giving lectures, but relies on his TAs for everything. Not a very hard class if you actually read the material. Also, every once in a while he'll decide he wants to give a pop quiz, so if you go to class make sure you take notes because the quiz will be on what you talked about in that class and you're allowed to use notes."
1062,2319524,5.0,4.0,"I loved learning from Dr. Hill! Some of the other raters have found issue with the way he teaches 1000 level HI, but that's honestly the format of all lower HI classes, no matter the professor. Dr. Hill was very helpful, very nice, and graded things quickly. I found his lectures very interesting, and you can tell he really cares about the subject."
1063,2319524,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Hill relied on his TAs for all grading. He taught the class, but didn't grade the essay tests. I had a problem with this. The TA that I had graded incredibly hard. I took this class as an easy A elective and barely made a C. My GPA prior to this class was a 3.7. I would never take another class from him."
1064,2319524,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Hill relied on his TAs a lot. He never actually graded any papers or exams, and never really seemed interested in talking with students. Very much dont talk to me, talk to your TA. His lectures were fine, but could sometimes be a struggle to through. All in all hes okay, but definitely not my favorite."
1065,2294950,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Miller is a fantastic professor. You could really tell she wanted the best for us, and she put a lot of care into making sure the content was understandable. Both the midterm and final were take-home exams, and we only had one formal essay to write. Just be warned that we had group discussion nearly every class, if that's something to avoid."
1066,2294950,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Miller is fantastic. She is very kind and caring! There are mini ""quizzes"" before each class starts, but as long as you at least skimmed the reading you'll do fine. She offered clear feedback on the essay and midterm. Her class is interesting and she makes it enjoyable! highly recommend her :)"
1067,2294950,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely love Dr. Miller! She is so willing to help both inside and outside of class, gives very constructive criticism and genuinely cares about her students. You do have a quiz before almost every class, so you have to keep up on the readings. She gives a ton of grades though, so a mess up here and there is not the end of the world."
1068,2294950,5.0,2.0,"I had Dr Miller for honors comp 2 and I loved her. She gives a lot of papers, but she gives a good bit of freedom with each one so you can be creative and show your own style. She gives awesome feedback for each paper. She gives little quizzes on the textbook reading, but youll be fine if you just skim the chapters. Would recommend to anyone!!!"
1069,2294950,5.0,4.0,"I loved Dr. Miller's class! It is a lot of work, but I learned a lot. She is very nice and always willing to help. Make sure you get the textbooks. Quizzes are given almost every class, so be sure to read the material. I highly recommend this class!"
1070,2294950,2.0,4.0,"I got an A on the first 3 papers, but for some reason she gave me a B in the class. She didn't show us our grade for the last essay so we couldn't come see her about it. If you're a good writer, the essays will be easy. She just grades REALLY tough. Lots of busy work, quizzes, and group work every class. I absolutely learned nothing."
1071,2294950,3.0,5.0,"She is very nice but she is very serious about English. You spend the entire class doing busy work and have homework due every class. If you are not passionate about English, I would not recommend her. She is helpful in office hours and if you are good at English and willing to work for a good grade, you will do fine w her"
1072,2294950,5.0,2.0,"I loved Prof Miller. It's her first semester here at Mississippi State, and as a non-English major having to take comp, she made it completely bearable. About four papers this semester, all of which it is easy to make a good grade on. No tests and we won't have a final either. She is so chill and calm and very caring about her students. Take her!"
1073,1975468,4.5,3.0,She did a great job of making it interesting. I'm going to do a minor in psychology because of her class. Would definitely take again.
1074,1975468,4.5,3.0,"Mrs. Pollard is very intelligent, very helpful in class, and her lectures are interesting. She teaches psychology from a medical standpoint which really interested me and always made me want to come to her class. She is very beautiful and successful and I would recommend anyone to take her class. Her General Psychology class was productive. "
1075,1975468,5.0,3.0,really interesting class.   plus she's easy to look @
1076,2204845,2.0,5.0,"Radhika is very difficult to understand. She has a very strong accent. When asked to explain things in more detail, she says we must work the problems ourselves and can't learn from watching her work them. She does not curve any tests or give bonus points for anything, and she has a tough grading scale. Do not recommend if you need a good grade"
1077,2204845,1.0,5.0,She taught horribly. Expected us to self learn some of the chapters because she taught too slow. Added extra classes at the end of the semester because she taught too slow. Belittled students for asking questions. Overall absolutely horrible teacher. I understand that Organic Chemistry is not easy but wow... I learned more from students than her.
1078,2294965,1.0,3.0,"He does not give instructions on how to make a good grade, so good luck trying to read his mind to see what he's looking for on the assignments. Also, it's often hard to understand what he is trying to say when he types something out. Since this is an online class, that communication barrier makes this course way harder than it should be."
1079,2294965,4.0,3.0,"I enjoyed this class, and finished with an A in this course. However, I will agree with the above rating he doesn't specify exactly what should be done in his assignments, but after careful consideration of guidelines I was able to figure his instructions out and receive a very good grade."
1080,2294965,2.0,4.0,This professor mads the class way harder than it had to be. Was not specific on most assignments. It made for a very stressful semester. If you have a choice I would recommend taking someone else.
1081,2737338,5.0,2.0,"You are only allowed two unexcused absences, and any more after that it will start to effect your grade. The lectures are pretty interesting though and never last the full class time so it wasn't bad. They quizzes are online and not too bad, and for tests I just went over quizlet flashcards a few times. Overall, I def recommend her for gen psych."
1082,2737338,5.0,2.0,She posts all of the ppts & gave 2 extra credit assignments. She gave 12 quizzes (1/topic) & removed the lowest scored quiz. The tests are 50 m/c questions & honestly super easy they didnt take the full 75min we were given. She could have gone into more detail with some things but overall she made the class interesting & you dont need a textbook
1083,2737338,3.0,4.0,"I had Ms. Mack for Gen Psych. She is very sweet and understanding being she is a grad student herself. However, she goes extremely fast with lectures and does not go into depth as much as I wished she would have. YOU HAVE TO STUDY FOR HER TEST OR YOU WILL NOT PASS. She gives a review DO IT!!!! You are only graded on quizzes and test!"
1084,2786494,4.0,2.0,Dr. Daisy Jones Brown is a decent teacher she is kind and considerate. However I don't know where she gets some of her questions from that are on the exams. If you do the quizzes each week you should still pass the class. If you study you should be able to easily get an A.
1085,1189057,3.0,2.0,Chambers was great Public Speaking teacher
1086,1189057,5.0,1.0,Dr. C is a super good teacher! She only does 1 speech at the end. Highly recommend her for communications! Easy A if you try!
1087,1189057,4.0,2.0,She's such a nice lady and will always be eager to offer help. Super understanding.
1088,1189057,4.0,2.0,"Mrs.C is a good teacher, but it is a lot of group projects and can be hard. It isn't too bad though. Attendance is mandatory and especially on speech days. Easy class."
1089,1189057,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. C is the kindest professor Ive had! So soft spoken, the class is relatively easy as long as you do your work. Participation plays a big role in your overall grade. I made a high A and as long as you do your work and participate in class/be respectful its easy to!"
1090,1189057,3.0,4.0,"Not bad, Group projects are HARD and kind of strange."
1091,1189057,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Chambers made my FYE class very engaging and fun. She made tackling public speaking and giving speeches very easy. Overall, can not recommend her enough for any class in the Communications Department. Also, gave extra credit for going to debate team practices and competitions."
1092,1189057,5.0,1.0,"One of my favorite teachers! Even if you hate giving speeches, this class is so much more than that. The group projects are fun and not a burden, and Mrs. C makes class fun and interesting! I highly recommend!!"
1093,1189057,5.0,2.0,"She is WONDERFUL! She's so easy to understand, friendly, and engaging. Class was never boring! She was very understanding when it comes to grading speeches, and gave helpful feedback. She does do an extra credit option, and you can earn a cheat sheet for the midterm and final. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK she doesn't use it!"
1094,1189057,5.0,1.0,easy
1095,1189057,5.0,3.0,Thought the FYE would be different. But overall the class is good started for someone who wants to improve their speaking skills. There are 4 main assignments and she clearly states how she is going to grade and what she expects. I would definitely take her class again.
1096,1189057,2.0,4.0,"Mrs. Chambers is a nice person, but for this class she was not qualified at all to teach it. She would have to look things up as she taught and frequently had to contact I.T. to ask questions. She not know how to work the program and she would get mad at us when we didn't either. She would make you feel stupid if you coded somehting wrong."
1097,1189057,1.0,4.0,Attendance is required and she gives a ton of out of class group projects. There are a ton of speeches. She canceled class on Valentine's Day 5 minutes before class but still made us meet and send in our projects. Wish I would've taken a different professor.
1098,1189057,4.0,4.0,"Love Her, she gets your not a communication major. You do work for your grade even if it's an F."
1099,1189057,4.5,2.0,"This teacher was great. She knows people aren't majoring in communications and just wants you to improve. Attendance is 10% of your grade, so you must go. Very reasonable with speech days/other things interfering. Great professor, highly recommend. Makes class interesting!"
1100,1189057,5.0,2.0,she's pretty cool just make sure you go to class and actually try in class and on homework. ALWAYS DO YOUR HOMEWORK
1101,1189057,5.0,2.0,So sweet! will help you get the grade you need and very encouraging to those with anxiety giving speeches!
1102,1189057,5.0,2.0,"I loved this class.  Cheryl is very open and honest about the difficulty of public speaking, and she doesn't expect you to be a professional by the time you leave the class-- she just expects you to get better at speaking to a group.  She loves group work and creativity within the group.  Just think outside of the box, and you will get an A."
1103,1189057,4.0,4.0,"Her class is challenging compared to other speech classes that I took at a smaller college, but I still recommend her as an instructor for this class.  She is knowledgeable about the subject, does a good job of explaining what she's teaching, and really makes the class fun."
1104,2737345,2.0,3.0,"He is okie. He is good at teaching, you will not need the book his lectures pretty much sum up the tests, just study and you will do fine. He has quizzes after every chapter. However, not the biggest fan of his personality, and can kinda be rude sometimes. Overall though if you need the class its a good class to take."
1105,2688200,4.0,1.0,"EASY A. This class has open book, open note tests, simple assignments, and fairly interesting class periods. He is personable with students, and he is cool."
1106,2385105,2.0,4.0,"I am in my second class with Dr. Freyne, and I dont recommend. Between constant conservative rants in class with nothing to do with the material, being rude to students who ask for help (in an accusatory way), and a grading criteria that will crucify you for the smallest mistake, he is easily one of the most frustrating profs Ive ever taken."
1107,2385105,2.0,4.0,He is not the best teacher when it comes to explaining things and will talk back to you if you ask questions. His quizzes are supposedly over what you do in class but they rarely actually match up. In general he seems a little slow at times yet acts like hes the only one who knows anything. Overall do not recommend.
1108,1361123,5.0,3.0,YES!
1109,1361123,2.0,4.0,"I took the class Modern Western world and it was not good. There were 2 exams, we had to learn 60 terms just for 5 of them to be on the exam and there were 2 essays on each exam, and the lectures had nothing to do with the the exams because the exams were on the readings. I would not recommend this class to anyone."
1110,1361123,5.0,2.0,"Brain is very passionate and makes the lectures very interesting. There is a LOT to read however. Overall, the class is pretty easy and Brain is fun to listen to since he is so passionate about the subject. If you like history I would definitely recommend it. "
1111,1361123,5.0,3.0,I love this class YALL are gonna roleplay every day. Honestly he isnt bad just skim over the chapters of the book. He grades fairly easy. I love this class.
1112,1361123,5.0,4.0,Love him the best Professor I have had.
1113,1361123,5.0,4.0,"This class is hard, don't get me wrong, but the information he provides in lectures is exactly what you'll find on the tests. The lectures, if you listen, are detailed but be sure to keep up. Extra credit is HEAVY in this class (if you try) and the activities in the discussions make the information fun to learn. Don't miss class!!!!!"
1114,1361123,1.0,5.0,Only two tests and its easy to mess up if you dont show up. The tests were easy but graded too hard and he didnt cover all the material that well. Sections are fun but be sure you show up and read the materials. You dont know what youre suppose to write during lectures. Honestly was just generally rude to our class and a little disorganized.
1115,1361123,5.0,4.0,"Oh my God... This is easily one of the easiest classes to screw up yet one of the best teachers at MSU- Attendance is not mandatory but if you don't come you will fail the tests. On top of that, every week there is new reading for the supplementary discussion session. If you do not do the reading you will fail all of them. extra credit is abundant"
1116,1361123,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Brain is one of the best professors at MSU. His classes are extremely interesting and fun to attend. However, you do have to keep up with your readings and tests are challenging."
1117,1361123,5.0,5.0,"Great Teacher, probably one of the best i have had, but you have to keep up and do some serious work if you want to do well.  Dr. Brain is an extremely smart man and if you actually want to learn something take his class."
1118,1361123,4.5,3.0,Great teacher.  Inspired me to change my major to history.  Very funny and easy to listen to.  Highly recommended.
1119,1361123,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher, does require you to keep up with your work. If you keep up you will find this class easy enough and fun."
1120,1361123,3.5,4.0,"Very hard class. Quizzes everyday over the reading assigned.... Every single day. If your willing to read 50 pages every night you'll be fine, but if you aren't you won't do well at all"
1121,2581734,5.0,3.0,"This class is a seminar and so the entire premise is completing a food/nutrition related video presentation as a group project. Overall, there are only a few assignments with fairly clear expectations on what needs to be done. Overall, Dr. White is very understanding and is very timely in answering questions. Overall this class was interesting ."
1122,2761964,4.0,2.0,"Rima Musser was a good teacher. The class was not super challenging, but I learned a lot. Stay on top of the readings!"
1123,2434286,5.0,2.0,"Such a great guy, really loves his work. Follow along during lecture and he will give you everything you have to know for the tests. Very intelligent and grade fair. Will do quizzes, sometimes its simply attendence. Gives HW if he cancels class but its simple."
1124,2721009,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Jones was a very good teacher in my opinion. His class wasn't very hard, but he had a child & took paternity leave in the middle of Sep., so that definitely affected the course. Still, his class is worth taking for fun lectures & great explanations of the data structures. He is also very helpful with C++ code, and the programs were not hard."
1125,2721009,4.0,5.0,"James is nice, but this class is super hard. Ive heard that its hardest with Aubrey and easiest with Devin. So try to take Devin. But James does try to help us and hes nice to us. One of the programs that he wrote was ridiculously hard. Go to class and take notes. Start the programs as soon as they are assigned bc theyre hard and take forever"
1126,2721011,5.0,3.0,Devin is by far the best professor I have taken in the CSE department. Comp Org was well structured around the nand2tetris projects and Devin made sure the material was understandable. He is the type of guy to really stand up for his students and make sure they are getting the instruction they are paying for. I would highly recommend taking him.
1127,2721011,5.0,3.0,"Devin was great for discrete structures. He was readily available over the discord whenever we had questions, even when related to other classes. He made sure the assignments would actually help us and would make sure the exam questions were on stuff we had actually covered. I definitely recommend his classes."
1128,2721011,5.0,2.0,Devin is a wonderful guy and a great professor. He is very easy to get in touch with and communicate to and is always friendly and willing to help. He does not go out of his way to make the learning process difficult on his students like some others might. 
1129,2721011,5.0,4.0,"Since Mr. Neal started teaching, he has put significant time and effort into updating existing CS curriculum. Either building on open source material or creating projects from scratch, he is striving to create classes that engage us and effectively teach complex concepts. He has gone beyond expectations in helping us as students to learn and grow."
1130,2721011,5.0,1.0,"Devin is a teacher that purely cares about his students in a department that usually doesn't. He makes things easy for you, and his class isn't trying to compete for all your free time like some courses do. Tests, quizzes, and homework are all easy and are very direct. If you don't know something, look it up. That's what people do in their jobs."
1131,2721011,5.0,3.0,One of the best instructors Mississippi State has. Ever meet someone who has found their niche and you can tell they were born for that role? That's Instructor Neal. Born to be a teacher. Not only is his presentation digestable but willing to help and explain it on the students terms so they can actually learn. 
1132,2721011,5.0,1.0,"Very easy to get ahold of. Projects are very easy. He is very understanding. if you can take him in ANY class, take him. Ive had him for multiple classes and he was the same in all of them 10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
1133,2721011,5.0,1.0,"Loved his class. He focuses on the content that is actually useful and is very reasonable with workload and grading. All tests are online and open-note. Attendance is optional but I would recommend it, his explanations are much more helpful than Zybooks. He wants to see his students do well and will help whenever he can. Highly recommend!"
1134,2721011,4.0,2.0,Mr. Neal is a great professor. He'll give you all the information you need during lectures and responds very quickly to his Discord DM's. The lectures feel a little boring but the material is not exceptionally difficult. He always teaches in a good mood and cracks a lot of jokes to make class more engaging.
1135,2721011,5.0,3.0,"Not better teacher in the CSE. Transparent, knowledgeable and supportive. Goes above and beyond"
1136,2721011,2.0,3.0,"Instead of answering student questions, he makes fun of them for not knowing Linux commands (unrelated to class) in a separate part of the discord server."
1137,2721011,3.0,2.0,Mr. Neal was an adequate teacher. He got his point across but didnt spark my interest in the topics. Almost seemed to go through the motions. Some students loved him because he would pretty much do thats work for them. That isnt the sign of a great teacher.
1138,2721011,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors in NA. Went above and beyond with explaining in depth in material.
1139,2721011,5.0,3.0,"Programming is hard as we all know, but Mr. Neal made it a bit easier to understand. He broke a lot of things down and made them easier for me to understand at least. Also the way he words his programs were worded, there wasnt much confusion about what needed to be done. 100% recommended taking him."
1140,2721011,5.0,2.0,"Cuts out unneccessary information, strictly teaches about data structures. Funny, caring, responsive, if you show up and participate it's an easy A"
1141,2721011,5.0,3.0,"Devin is the man when it comes to the CSE department. He saved us from a lot of pointlessly complicated assignments coming down from the department and went above and beyond to make sure we succeed, putting in countless extra hours to explain things and talk to us outside of class. No matter what class, if you can take him, do it."
1142,2721011,5.0,3.0,"Absolute gem of a teacher. Hes a great teacher and truly understands what he is teaching. He has been great and helpful with the programs, being there if you needed any help, and has been honest with the course. Would recommend him for any course he teaches, a great guy!"
1143,2721011,5.0,3.0,Excellent professor!!!!!!
1144,2721011,5.0,2.0,"Really nice. Tests are online with no time limit, and if you read the slides theyre super easy. Pushes back homework due dates for people that have trouble with Zybooks or missed the deadline. He made videos about Data Structures programs even though this is Discrete bc he felt that they were too hard. Take him for Data if you can."
1145,2721011,5.0,4.0,"Great guy. If he thinks an assignment is stupid hell make his own, and those are pretty fair. Very willing to help outside of class. Only issue is I think we should have more class time, but that might be a course issue."
1146,2721011,5.0,1.0,Devin Neal is very nice. He has slides and uploads them with videos after class. His tests are online with no time limit and 2 attempts. He teaches a section of Data Structures and knows that its a hard class. I have a different professor for that class but Devin talks to us about DS and tries to help us. He cares abt students. Very accessible.
1147,2434294,5.0,2.0,"I love Dr. Outlaw, I've had her for Avain Diversity and Animal physiology. Phys was online but she was still easy to communicate with. Avian was in person and she always is in a good mood and is very fun in her lectures. Her material is easy if you pay attention in class and read her slides. 10/10 recommend."
1148,2434294,5.0,2.0,Mrs. Outlaw is super nice and sends reminders for literally every assignment. Added a few extra points to every test for commonly missed questions. Her tests are very straightforward from her lectures and powerpoints and the quizzes and lab quizzes were very straightforward as well!
1149,2434294,5.0,2.0,"I loved taking this class through Dr. Outlaw! She was so caring and reachable when I ever had any questions. She emailed weekly any assignments, quizzes, and/or tests we had. Her tests were very straightforward. I would recommend Dr. Outlaw and any of her classes to anyone and everyone. Thoroughly enjoyed this class."
1150,2434294,5.0,3.0,"There are so many quizzes! But she sends you a weekly reminder of what should be done that week. Watch her videos and take notes, and you should pass the class. Final is optional. She made the class very interesting! Wish I had her in person."
1151,2434294,5.0,1.0,"Highly recommend for animal physiology, she really cares about her students understanding the concepts. She sends weekly emails letting you know what is expected of the week. Each test you'll know what is expected of you. Plus the final is optional&#55358;&#56698;"
1152,2434294,5.0,2.0,I took her for graduate animal physiology. I would recommend her to anyone needing the course.
1153,2434294,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Outlaw is an amazing professor. She was very relational and very understanding. Before her class, I could have cared less about the subject but she taught it in such an engaging way that I am now in love with the topic! Take her!!"
1154,2434294,5.0,4.0,"Great lady! Fun class, though beware of tests. They are essay style (10 options answer 6) and can cover material discussed in class that is not in Power pt. Can run by office for any questions, totally approachable! Id take her class again without question! No quizzes, just a presentation (you choose topic) (easy A if done with effort)."
1155,1295610,5.0,3.0,Great professor. Learned so much about technology and education.
1156,1295610,1.0,5.0,Online....did not learn one thing. Tons of busy work.
1157,1295610,3.0,5.0,"Only teaches online courses.  Workload is off the charts--it's difficult to keep up during the regular semester, but nearly impossible to get everything done in a 5-week term, since she retains all assignments from the full semester!  Unfortunately, both of her courses are required for TKT graduate students.  A very unpleasant experience."
1158,1877260,2.5,5.0,She believes in paired teaching.
1159,1877260,4.5,4.0,"She is an amazing and hilariously weird. The tests are multiple choice and essay type of questions. It helps to take the time to really study the mechanisms and function of each process that she goes over. Also, make sure to question yourself on how two topics relate and contrast and if you take out one mechanism, will the process still work."
1160,1877260,4.5,4.0,"She has quizzes that are before the tests that kind of go over whats on the tests, but there is so much material in each chapter that make each test pretty tough.  The Lab is 50% of the grade which helps a lot.  The final is optional if you are ok with what you have at the end of the semester."
1161,1877260,5.0,3.0,"She's a great teacher. Not an easy class, but with studying and coming to class every day, it is possible to get an A."
1162,771351,1.5,5.0,This is the most poorly organized course I have ever participated in (and I have taken a lot and done well) Dr Wise seems completely unwilling to do anything to make the course material accessible to the students.
1163,771351,1.5,4.0,"This professor sounds bored with his own lectures, does not edit previous mistakes in course material, seems very irritated by student communication, and responds to student queries late, snippy, and usually in as few words as possible. He really should get out of teaching and stick to research."
1164,771351,1.0,4.0,"Refuses to answer questions, ever. If you eventually get him to answer, it will be rude or snarky, and about 5 words. I have never seen a teacher/professor who appears to be so irritated by his students and seems to want us all to go away."
1165,771351,1.0,5.0,Does nothing to help you.  I don't think he really wants to teach.  Refuses to answer questions.  You're all on your own with this guy!
1166,771351,4.0,3.0,The material is kind of difficult but just about all the test questions come from the study guide so if you know that you'll get an A.
1167,2622749,5.0,1.0,"A fantastic professor who is easy to get in touch with and is very helpful. He really wants all students to do well in his class. There is no excuse for not getting an A in his class. The content is easy and as long as you watch his videos he will guide you through the homework like a tutor. If you can, take any courses taught by him. "
1168,2622749,5.0,1.0,"The lectures were very boring to me, but he does not count attendance and canceled class quite often. The quizzes and tests were online and very easy. You have two attempts on each of them, so it is easy to fix what you missed on them."
1169,2622749,5.0,1.0,"attendence didnt matter at all, no homework easy A if your interested in weather and that type of stuff. would get out of class very early 75% of the time"
1170,2622749,4.0,2.0,"He's a good professor, but the class is very boring. He did say that he's new to teaching world geography. There are 4 exams, and they're online. The quizzes are online as well, but super easy. Easy class to take if ya'll need an A. Don't buy the book because you will NEVER use it."
1171,2622749,5.0,1.0,Never took attendance because the scanner was broken but he did say at the beginning of the semester attendance is optional. all slides were on canvas. every exam was open notes and had 2 attempts so you can easily get a 100. funny teacher and tried to keep the lectures interesting on boring topics.
1172,2622749,5.0,2.0,"This was definitely an easier class. He does a good job explaining everything, especially in the weather portion of the class. If you are interested in this field you will have a great time in this class. Exams are also very easy. You really have to try to do bad in this class to get a bad grade. Overall would recommend!"
1173,2622749,3.0,3.0,He explained to us that this was not his speciality so he struggled some especially with the lab. Super nice but lectures were boring especially if you are not majoring in this field.
1174,2753837,5.0,3.0,"I am a graduating senior at MSU and Dr. Kim is by far the best teacher I have encountered. For my entire time in aerospace engineering at MSU, I have felt invisible and unwelcomed. After just a few classes with Dr. Kim, you will realize that you are an engineer that deserves to be where you are. He goes out of his way to be amazing. Take him! "
1175,2753837,5.0,4.0,NICEST GUY EVER! Went out of his way to offer help to students he noticed were struggling. He's a pretty new teacher but was very open to feedback so he improved a lot over the semester. It's hard to understand his accent and he writes super fast but he posts his notes online so it helps. Mostly learned from using class notes to do the homework. &lt;3
1176,419117,5.0,2.0,"I would quite literally die for Marty Price. He is so so kind and considerate. I've taken him twice now mainly because I love him so much. You do have to write a lot of papers and the material can be a little boring, but he does his best to make the class interesting and is very obviously knowledgable about the topics he discusses."
1177,419117,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Price is one of the best teachers at MSU. He gives lectures at every class, but for the most part they are enjoyable. The only grades are papers and quizzes. For each paper, he encourages you to send him your rough draft and he helps you correct any problems he sees. I rented the book, but all of the readings can be found for free online."
1178,419117,5.0,3.0,"Many students find Mr. Price's classes to be quite difficult, but I disagree. I have taken four of his classes, and would continue to do so if I hadn't run out. He is very passionate about what he teaches and cares about communicating with his students, both inside and outside of class. He always looks at rough drafts and gives instant feedback!"
1179,419117,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Price was one of the best English teachers I have ever had. He gives amazing feedback and even looks at paper rough drafts. I highly recommend this class and this professor. He is very knowledgeable and good at what he does. Attendance is required, but he makes class interesting."
1180,419117,5.0,4.0,"People who don't like Dr. Price are lazy. His class can get a little boring but he breaks down the readings well &amp; if you pay attention he basically gives all the analyzation you need for ALL work in his class. He's very passionate &amp; intelligent, &amp; inspires love for literature. I paid attention and found the class easy once you got into the rhythm."
1181,419117,5.0,3.0,"I was thrown into Professor Price's class a few weeks into school because of some scheduling conflicts, and his reviews made me so scared! I promise though, he has grown to be my favorite professor! He is hilarious and is very willing to give you feedback on rough drafts and answer any questions you have regarding the weekly quizzes or papers!"
1182,419117,2.0,4.0,"He's not mean, but it is so difficult to understand what he is saying. He talks using old words, and it is hard to interpret what he is talking about, which makes it difficult to understand the material. We have three 5 page papers to complete and those are really the only grades. We have weekly quizzes, but they don't count. He grades SO HARD!!!!!"
1183,419117,3.0,2.0,"While the class is fairly easy with his lecture notes online, the lectures are quite boring. Its short quizzes every week, but if you take notes in class youll do fine. 3-4 papers, he doesnt grade too hard, &amp; the material is online so its easy enough. Hes so willing to help in office hours and through email, but the class is too uninteresting."
1184,419117,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Price is an easy A. He gives online quizzes once a week and 4 papers. He posts notes online that you can use to get an easy A on the quizzes, but he only wants you to write what he said in class, so notes are pertinent. He plays favorites, so participate a little. Also, if you send him a rough draft you will get a good grade no matter what."
1185,419117,5.0,2.0,"Marty Price is an amazing professor. I had him for two classes back to back and passed both with high A's. He requires participation, and if you do, he will favor you. Papers take alot of thought but are easy. Taking him again."
1186,419117,4.0,2.0,"Mr. Price is an odd professor, but one who really cares about his students. There are no exams for his class, but 4 papers and weekly quizzes (which are easy if notes are taken during class). He allows students to email him rough drafts and will help whenever needed. He grades everything almost as soon as it's submitted and always responds to email"
1187,419117,1.0,5.0,"He does not explain the material, seems as though he expects you to know all of the information beforehand because he does not attempt to relay the message. Do not take this class, run someone who will take the time to explain, because college is about learning."
1188,419117,4.0,2.0,"Prices lectures are boring, but pretty necessary for the papers. 2 papers, an easy quiz every Friday, and a final essay. English Ed major so I gotta take all these classes anyway. Prices class is much preferred to anybody elses."
1189,419117,2.0,4.0,"Lots of paper, long lectures, be sure to keep up with readings or you will be lost in the class..... do NOT procrastinate on the papers. look over materials before taking quizzes"
1190,419117,3.0,4.0,Price is a great literature professor. He is extremely passionate about what he is teaching and truly wants the best for his class. He is a bit awkward but its not too bad. Get ready to write ALOT. You'll have 4-5 essays in this class with the last one being your final. If you follow his instructions and send him a rough draft you'll be fine!
1191,419117,1.0,3.0,"He is the most boring professor I have ever taken. He is strongly opinionated on many things. there are 3 papers and weekly quizzes. If your opinion does not match up to his, then you will get a C on all papers."
1192,419117,5.0,3.0,"A lot of people do not like Professor Price, but I would have to disagree with those people. Is his class boring at times? Yes, but if you choose to really listen then you will learn so much. He will favor you if you pay attention and respond in class. Be prepared to agree with his opinions if you want to do well on papers."
1193,419117,5.0,1.0,"Marty Price is definitely a personality, whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. He was super enthusiastic about what he taught, and he was helpful with feedback on the papers. You just need to show up and appear like you kind of care, and you'll have an easy A."
1194,419117,1.0,3.0,"Professor Price is very his way or the high way, especially when it comes to papers. Though he seems like a nice guy, he is not nice at ALL when it comes to feedback on papers he doesn't agree with, which is very discouraging. Tests and quizzes are easy, all of the information you need is online. Class itself is very, very boring."
1195,419117,2.0,2.0,"Snore. To be fair, the course material is notoriously boring, but the professor doesn't exactly do much to liven it up. You will fall asleep during lectures unless you enjoy his many awkward jokes. I barely cracked a book for this class and got an A. Good course to take if you don't care about the material and need the credit."
1196,419117,4.0,3.0,"Price is an odd old man, but is passionate ab Amer. Lit. He talks kind of sophisticated so it was hard to follow at times but the notes posted online covers everything needed to succeed the class. Likes participation. Likes to help w/ papers before they're due. Opinionated. 2 tests (50pts each), 4 papers (100pts. each), &amp; small quiz due every Fri."
1197,419117,4.0,3.0,"Professor Price can be pretty boring during lectures, but he is a good professor to take. All of the material is pretty straight forward, and he goes over everything in class. Everything that you will be tested on -- test form and paper form -- will be discussed in class so it is very easy to make a good grade."
1198,419117,2.0,3.0,He basically grades you on whether or not you agree with his viewpoint on a subject. There isn't much leeway when it comes to your own analysis of a work and he will make it known if he accepts it or not. His lectures are immensely boring but you get quizzes each week that help your grades. Just remember that your opinion doesn't really matter.
1199,419117,4.0,3.0,"Marty is a great english teacher, an old guy who looks like Santa, and is hilarious. He can be boring at times with his monotone voice, but his English Lit class is pretty easy if you pay attention and study for quizzes. Very nice guy who you should take."
1200,419117,5.0,4.0,"Without a doubt, best english teacher on campus and funny as hell! I'm not a huge fan of any literature really, but I enjoyed his class immensely. If you have to take lit and Mr. Price is an option then by all means do yourself a favor and add his class."
1201,419117,4.0,2.0,"Price is the easiest English professor on this campus. He lectures for almost the entire 50 minutes, which is nice until he calls on you and you haven't been paying attention. He's so kind and is interested in what you have to say about everything."
1202,419117,4.0,3.0,"Although the lectures are very boring, it's an easy A if you know how to write a paper. There's weekly online quizzes that are extremely easy and help your grade a lot. His lectures may be slow and long, but he is passionate about the material and makes it as interesting as possible but get ready for some awkward silence."
1203,419117,4.0,1.0,"Mr. Price, although long-winded and slightly boring, creates a great learning atmosphere. He is really invested in the material he is teaching, and puts the notes online so you can learn them as well. While the actual class lectures are close to unbearable, it is easy to get an A. Overall, I would take him again for this course 10/10 times."
1204,419117,3.5,1.0,He's a bit crazy and out there but probably the easiest A I've gotten in both classes I have taken from him. His online notes are all you really need. Attendance is technically mandatory but if when you do come you participate you'll be fine.
1205,419117,1.0,2.0,"I believe in one set of his class notes he says something is the way it is because ""this is my class and I said so"". Not very helpful. Lectures are hard to follow. Tests are really easy and he grades easily on papers, but his class lectures are unbearable. "
1206,419117,1.0,4.0,"He grades students differently depending on how much and how vocally they agree or disagree with him. He allows students to turn in papers 3 weeks late without taking off their grade, but grades based on ""ability"" instead of actual content of the paper. And by lectures are long, I mean it would have been less painful to pull out my own nails."
1207,419117,1.0,3.0,I never thought i would have a professor try so hard to manipulate my beliefs through my writing. He failed my final project because he didn't agree. Take another class. He is weird and you will understand the first day if you're unlucky enough to sign up. 
1208,419117,3.0,1.0,"It's a pretty easy class for the most part. You don't have to pay attention or take notes. Just show up and pretend you are listening then read his class notes online to study. He is a bit weird and gets into a ""role"" too much sometimes, but he's very nice and friendly for the most part. Grades easy and tests don't require much studying"
1209,419117,3.0,2.0,"He is a good professor, but his lectures are sometimes hard to follow. "
1210,419117,1.5,4.0,"I have never had someone grade so harshly. He is very confusing and does not explain himself well. He teaches for an hour on nothing that pertains to the test, quizzes, or papers."
1211,419117,3.5,1.0,"His quizzes come directly from notes, and he grades easy on papers.  All you have to do is show up and do the work."
1212,419117,3.5,1.0,A bit nuts but easy for the most part.  Any grades came almost directly from his class &quot;lectures&quot; because I read nothing.
1213,419117,3.0,2.0,"Good teacher, overall. A little opinionated, but not a difficult teacher. Read for class and speak up when he asks a question, and you'll be fine."
1214,419117,4.0,4.0,"He is very knowledgable and provides tons of online materials. Lots of reading, papers and quizzes, but as long as you go to class and do the readings, you should be fine. I have enjoyed his classes for 2 semesters now."
1215,419117,4.5,2.0,he is a very good teacher. I is always there to help you if you ever need anything. He is very easy on grading papers. He made the class very interesting.
1216,419117,4.0,4.0,"Gives quizzes every day, and a LOT of reading.  He's an old guy that demands participation, & is available to students. Gives participation points, and is very testy about attendance. Tell him if you need to leave early or come late. Wants HIS opinion."
1217,419117,1.5,5.0,"He's full of what NOT to do.  Although he certainly doesn't want your opinion, you'll get his in spades.  Takes the fun out of reading, because he only wants what he deems is the acceptable interpretation.  No free thinking allowed here!"
1218,1312047,5.0,2.0,Dr. Lim is the BEST Cal IV professor out there! She is very caring and offers extra credit on in class quizzes/exams. You can also make your own formula sheets for quizzes/exams. Friends of mine who did not have Lim complained that Cal IV was very hard and could not understand the material. Dr. Lim makes this class easy to understand!
1219,1312047,4.0,3.0,Solid professor. Explains concepts well and gives fair tests.
1220,1312047,4.0,4.0,"She allows a lengthy formula sheet for each quiz and test, has a drop quiz grade and drops 2 homeworks. She offers bonus points on every test for working problems completely. She also is very understanding if you need an extension. I would definitely recommend her. The content can be hard, but it is an easy pass."
1221,1312047,5.0,2.0,"Nice, excited, and engaging. Allows a &quot;formula sheet&quot; for every quiz and test that you can basically write all your notes on (just not specific examples). After transitioning online, she did make test questions harder but not unreasonable. Gives easy to understand lectures that are well organized. Gives extra points for good attendance."
1222,1312047,5.0,5.0,"Very nice teacher who was able to convey very complicated material in a simpler manner. She always posted notes online, allowed formula sheets on tests, and was accessible outside class. Smooth transition online because of covid-19. Final exam was very very hard but it had to be because we were all taking it from home. Highly recommend her."
1223,1312047,3.0,3.0,She was very chill and we had cheat sheets for everything. I would give her a 5 if it wasnt for what happened when the class went online. She made the final much more difficult than any of the previous tests. It took me 10 hours to finish. Most of the problems were very different from what we did in class.
1224,1312047,5.0,4.0,"Hyeona Lim was a great professor. She allowed us to use formula sheets for every quiz and test, which really cuts down on studying time required. Her lectures are very structured and she is great at explaining confusing concepts to make it seem easy. Would definitely recommend taking her for Cal 4!"
1225,1312047,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lim made cal 4 such a fun class! She has thorough notes that she uploads to Canvas, and only assigns a few homework assignments. She drops your two lowest hw grades; she also allows you to use a calculator and formula sheet on tests and quizzes. She is super sweet and will curve your grade if you get close to going up a letter grade."
1226,1312047,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Lim has been my favorite professor so far. Her lectures always begin with a review of concepts from previous classes and include several detailed examples for the new material. For the tests, you can use a calculator and several pages of formula sheets. She is also very accessible to answer questions. There is no excuse to not do well."
1227,1312047,5.0,1.0,"Lim is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She made cal 4 so enjoyable. She lets you use a ridiculous amount of formula sheets on tests and quizzes, gives plenty of homework, and gives lots of quizzes that prepare you for tests. The Mathematica projects were a little hard, but she is always so willing to help."
1228,1312047,5.0,1.0,"TAKE HER!!! She made Cal IV the easiest class ever. We have online homework (Webassign) that isn't hard, 11? quizzes, three exams, two mathematica projects, and a final. She gives plenty of extra credit problems and is a fair grader. Her lecture notes are easy to read and she works a bunch of problems in class (she posts it online after class)"
1229,2000182,5.0,2.0,"She's the absolute BEST!!! She's  willing to help and is  accessible outside of class. She gives very clear instructions and is a fair grade, and she doesn't mind extending due dates if she sees your really trying you're best!!"
1230,2000182,4.5,2.0,"The class was easy. She gave lots of opportunities for extra credit.  Also, many of her deadlines were extended.  GO TO THE WRITING CENTER - she gives bonus points on papers for simply going for 30 minutes.  "
1231,1795387,5.0,2.0,She is so nice.  She inspires me to do my best.  I like that she is both smart and very cute.  I will take all of her classes!
1232,1647932,2.0,4.0,"Dr Anderson did his lectures and immediately expected us to know what to do with the artifacts. We didn't know what to do with the artifacts, how to write reports, and how to use spreadsheets specifically for artifacts. Super hard class"
1233,1647932,1.5,5.0,"This class was long, boring, and not interesting at all. You really have to know and be interested in the stuff. He does not post any of his slide shows so if you miss class you will have to get it from your classmates or get them from the chapter. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE CHAPTERS BEFORE CLASS!!!"
1234,1647932,5.0,5.0,Hard class!  Doesn't post slides online and covers a lot of material.  Taught as a night class once a week.  You have to read and study to do well but it's possible.
1235,1647932,5.0,4.0,"A great professor but this is a hard intro level class.  You HAVE to take good notes and do the readings and should not expect an A or even a B unless you really put the time in.  Class average was about a 70 on the exams.  3 tests, weekly writing assignments, no extra credit.  Worth taking if you're interested and can commit to all the work."
1236,2417984,5.0,3.0,Really enjoyed his class! He lets you know exactly what to study for tests and always makes class interesting!
1237,1164613,5.0,3.0,"The class isn't overly easy, but he does a good job of explaining the material."
1238,1164613,5.0,1.0,"His tests come straight from the powerpoints, which he posts online.  He even lets you exempt the final if you have 0 absences.  Easiest class ever."
1239,2557271,5.0,3.0,"What an angel human! The amount of writing she assigns is reasonable. She's willing to review your papers with you before you turn them in (in a detailed way). She has eye opening lectures and is extremely patient when students' opinions differ from her own. Even if you're shy, she helps you improve your participation grade. 10/10 would recommend."
1240,2557271,5.0,3.0,I loved this class. I had her for Honors English Comp 1. She discussed very important issues such as racism and biases. The writing that we had to do was by no means excessive. She really cares to help you improve your writing and is able to explain how to improve the things you have written.
1241,2557271,5.0,3.0,"I LOVE HER! She is truly the best. I took her for Honors Comp and was so grateful. Discussions get very political and you may not agree with her but keeping an open mind and joining the discussion will benefit your grade. She grades based on participation so speak up! She also does a lot of projects, which are really interesting. I learned so much!"
1242,1762655,3.5,2.0,He's really cool gives alot of extra credit and puts all the notes online doesn't care if you come to class. Tests are kind of tricky but if you study you will be fine!
1243,1779043,4.0,4.0,"Class is entertaining. The tests are tough, half multiple choice, half short answer. She gives plenty of study material; test outlines, powerpoints, and a review day. "
1244,1779043,2.0,2.0,This class was VERY boring I believe it would have been so much better with a different teacher. The way she taught made it seems like she was teaching to herself/talking to herself. You do an in class assignment almost every week. The test were okay just make sure you listen. She also has short answer question on every single test.
1245,2508151,5.0,4.0,Jacob Crook is an amazing professor! He works to push his students to success! The only people that dont like Jacob are the lazy people who dont want to work when they come to class. He helped me produce beautiful pieces that will help me achieve my portfolio goals! He is willing to meet outside of class and is always quick to reply to emails!
1246,2729388,5.0,3.0,Explains everything very well. Gives bonus points on every test. Highly recommend 
1247,2729388,5.0,3.0,They give out short handouts for every chapter and help students understand the information that they teach. They work with students to accommodate their specific needs. I honestly don't have any cons
1248,2196926,4.0,5.0,"This was definitely the most difficult class I have taken in college. He clearly cares a lot about the information and knows what he is talking about, but the amount of information on each test is VERY heavy. You need to know pretty much every little detail that is discussed and on the slides in order to do well. "
1249,2196926,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Thornton cares a great deal about the course material, but this class was very difficult. Tests are very detailed and have a massive amount of bacteria. "
1250,2196926,5.0,4.0,This class was super interesting and he was a really great professor. Lots of information and going to class helped but attendance wasnt mandatory (just helpful as a drop grade for a pop quiz). Pop quizzes werent extremely hard but still important to pay attention and look over things for them. Tests were difficult but he gives extra credit
1251,2196926,5.0,4.0,"Pop quizzes. Test are short answer and quite tough. He goes into a lot of detail, but as long as you understand the overarching concept, you'll do ok. Curves exams a few points plus a bonus question. It's a LOT of material. Tons of small molecules, pathways, and procedures. Fill in the blank slides."
1252,2196926,5.0,4.0,"This is a difficult class, and Dr. Thornton covers a lot of material in a short amount of time. He is very passionate about the subject and makes class interesting. His tests are a mixture of multiple choice, fill in the blank, and case studies. You have to really understand the material to do well on the tests. Quizzes are difficult"
1253,2196926,4.0,3.0,"Mostly reads the slides but does elaborate on the concepts that are on the slides.  It's not mandatory to go to class because you can usually just read the textbook to understand the material.   He's got a good sense of humor so going to class isn't miserable plus he puts the powerpoint online to fill in.  Lab is worth half the grade, and it's fun."
1254,1803727,1.0,3.0,By far the worst teacher I have ever had. In the beginning she seemed very sweet and like she cared but by the end of the course she had turned into a monster. She tells you many times attendance isn't mandatory and even includes that on the syllabus but if you don't go to class no way you will pass. Tough grader horrible feedback. Don't take her
1255,1803727,4.0,2.0,FYE was a good class to learn how to set goals and better prepare for your future after college. There were no tests in the class and the items graded were pretty easy to complete. If you are looking for a fun class you can't go wrong.
1256,1803727,5.0,1.0,If you have to take English then you have to take this professor. Its that simple. You want regret it.
1257,1951187,5.0,2.0,"This professor is amazing. Probably the best English professor I've ever had. She really cares about her students and their well-being (not just their grades). Dr. MK is very invested in her study and is, therefore, excited about her subject. She makes friends with students and will help you with things outside of class even after you've graduated."
1258,1951187,5.0,2.0,Loved this professor and this class! Would recommend her to anyone.
1259,2295255,3.0,2.0,Honors Forum is boring most of the time. Speakers from different disciplines come and talk to you. Just participate and write the papers and you'll be fine. Make sure to do the papers in a five paragraph style and double space so you don't have to write as much.
1260,2295255,3.0,2.0,"I took Dr. Snyder for Honors Forum 1. The class itself was pointless, but I feel I would enjoy this professor in a different class because he seems very knowledgable. This was a team taught course where the deans of all the different colleges at MSU would come speak and we had to write at least five 2-page summaries on their presentation."
1261,2549214,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Kshemkalyani is very difficult to understand and she moves very quickly. I've always been an A, B student but I'm failing and expect to have to retake. Few people in my class understand her  "
1262,2549214,1.0,5.0,"I had professor Kshemkalyani for business calculus and I have never thought a professor could be any worse. I could not understand what she was teaching (and neither can she), she looks at u like youre stupid if you ask a question, and shes never at her office hours. Ended up failing the final and failing the class. I beg you not to take her clas"
1263,2549214,1.0,4.0,"MA 1613 B. cal: I would not recommend Mrs. K as a professor. If youve already taken a Cal class in high school or something youll probably be fine, however Mrs. I makes calculus very over complicated and hard to understand. I spent my whole semester making calls to my brother and teaching myself the math. And most of my class felt the same way."
1264,2549214,1.0,4.0,"I have had her for my business calculus class and it seems like she didnt even know what she was teaching. I was really struggling in the class and asked her if she could help me and she never gave a solid answer. Once I talked to people, I realized a lot of people were struggling just as bad as I was. I do not recommend her as a teacher."
1265,2549214,4.0,3.0,Ms. Kshemkalyani teaches in a way that is quite easy to understand if you pay attention in class. She isn't the most nice when it comes to answering questions so please don't ask a totally stupid question because she will look at you like you are crazy (from personal experience). Will drop a few bad tests/quiz grades if you don't miss class.
1266,2278894,3.0,1.0,"SUPER EASY CLASS!! Her accent is a little hard to understand, but she is super sweet and willing to help. She gives study guides for tests and exams. No homework, one paper, and study guide for the exam. 10/10 recommend."
1267,2246139,4.0,4.0,Took  her for an upper level history course.  You will read and print out a lot of material. Group discussions. She is very knowledgeable in her field.  Did not come to class with an ill attitude once this semester. She is nice and seems to care about student success.
1268,2246139,2.0,4.0,"You have to go to class in order to pass this class. Lectures are boring and she doesn't post the powerpoints. She somehow turns everything in world history back to Africa. You have to write long essays over comic books... Overall this is an easy class if you do the work, but she is really hardcore about no phones and overall kind of rude."
1269,2246139,1.0,4.0,"She expects you to write down what she has on the powerpoint AND what she is saying at the same time. Moves way too fast and also doesn't post the powerpoint. She gives random pop quizzes at the end of the semester no one is prepared for. I took this class for ""fun"" and it is the worst class/grade I've had and I'm usually an A student."
1270,2311677,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Bickle's course is extremely lecture heavy put he does provide all the available slides and resources through Canvas and anything else is usually drawn from the course's required reading. He very much expects class participation in discussion. Grade consists of a few take home exams, a discussion board every few weeks and one group project."
1271,2311677,2.0,4.0,"If you miss one class, he assumes you're dropping the course. Lectures are so heavy and the information is not easily retainable. I hated this class."
1272,2311677,4.0,2.0,"Would give him 5, but he asks questions he doesnt want people to answer. He will interrupt people which is frustrating. But the class itself is great and takes up no time."
1273,2311677,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Bickle is really smart &amp; cares about his students! Tests are basically take home, and he doesn't grade super hard. There is a group presentation, but it's easy. If you're going to take Intro to Philosophy, he's a good choice!"
1274,2311677,5.0,4.0,"Very good teacher. I took fall 2020, tests were given mostly as essays and given a few days to take them. We had one group presentation. Hes good at explaining"
1275,2311677,5.0,3.0,"He's a really sweet old man. I really respect him and he's super smart also so he knows basically everything it's scary. He's available outside of class for help before tests or papers. Go to class, I promise it helps even though it gets boring. Rewrites are available after the tests for a few extra points. TAKE HIM, he's awesome!!!"
1276,2188801,4.0,5.0,"Really tough course, put in the work you will be ok. He has a massive group project at the end of the course that is worth a lot of points and is a lot of work, as well as multiple case studies. Only one exam throughout the entire course though. He will help if asked, but you definitely have to pull your weight. Hardest business class at MSU."
1277,2188801,1.0,3.0,"This class was taken online due to the pandemic. Professor Singh would go weeks without posting anything or replying to emails, and then at 2am on a Saturday would post a half dozen assignments due the next week. His grading was erratic and inconsistent and no guidance was given on papers. Worst prof I have ever had and I learned nothing of value."
1278,2188801,4.0,5.0,"He does care, and the material seems to be valuable later. His accent is not bad. He teaches by asking you to contribute and think. If you're visual, it's hard because the quizzes are before the PowerPoint. This was a hard and time consuming class, but do your work, and pay attention to what he wants."
1279,2188801,1.0,4.0,"You are graded heavily and strictly on just a few assignments, which he gives no schedule or rubric for. Take it online."
1280,2311681,3.0,1.0,"It's a really boring class but it's super easy. There's a group project that he grades pretty hard. The tests are easy and he does a review the class before. Just go to class, it's not hard!"
1281,2000389,2.0,5.0,"The class is graded completely off of 4 tests. Nothing else. The lectures are so long and hard to pay attention to. She offers no work or online programs or homework to help you retain info, so you have to teach yourself the entire course. If you aren't good at studying, either don't take this, or pay for a private tutor."
1282,2000389,1.0,5.0,no. just no
1283,2000389,1.0,5.0,only have 4 test to pass. no other work 
1284,2000389,1.0,5.0,no
1285,2000389,4.0,3.0,"Immunology clicked for me and I didn't have many issues, but others struggled. Very few assignments, failing one is bad, even a low B on one makes an A difficult. No extra credit/penalty for attendance/anything else. 4 40 q tests (including final) all weighted equally. Make sure you can understand and answer her outline/study guide questions."
1286,2000389,1.0,4.0,"Grade based on 4 tests, 40 MC questions each. Posts powerpoints, study guides, & study guide answers. Same for Human Genetics. Not much advice for struggling students other than completing the study guides. Seems nice in class but not so much one-on-one. More worried about the class average than students success/understanding. 1st C in college."
1287,2000389,2.0,4.0,"Grade is entirely based on 4 tests. Had difficulty answering students' questions and remaining on topic. Lectures are extremely boring and hard to stay focused, especially at 9 am."
1288,2000389,4.0,4.0,"Lectures are super long and can be boring at time, but shes very passionate about the topic. There were just 4 exams, no final. tests are okay but DEFINITELY study! she posts note outlines to canvas so you have to go to lectures to fill in the blanks"
1289,2000389,2.0,4.0,"McCurdy herself was very nice, but the actual class is not. Besides two very small extra credit assignments, the only grades are tests. The text book is not required but I got a digital version so I recommend going over the chapters for some extra help. The lecture slides are fill in the blank, but they don't really help much for studying."
1290,2000389,3.0,4.0,"takes forever to go over 13 slides, do not buy the book biggest waste of $100 only used it twice. Overall very sweet lady - the study questions are very helpful for studying for exams, but the exams are worded very tricky"
1291,2000389,1.0,5.0,hard to understand and only reads whats on the slides does not help with the difficulty of the test so read the text book
1292,2000389,5.0,4.0,McCurdy is by far the best professor for bio. Her lectures may be boring but as long as you do the study questions or just study the notes the tests are not hard at all.
1293,2000389,3.0,5.0,"DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK McCurdy is a very nice lady and is really sweet towards her students. However, her class is impossible there are only 4 test grades for the whole entire year and no homework assignments so if you do bad on one test ur not gonna pass the class. Tests are also very difficult and if you dont study you will fail."
1294,2000389,5.0,3.0,"Dr. McCurdy is a wonderful professor! Her notes are fill-in-the-blank. Let me repeat. Fill. In. The. Blank. Do the study guides, actually study (go through all your notes, rewrite them, read them aloud, etc.) and you will pass with a high grade. Also, try to sit closer to the front in the lecture hall; it helps your concentration. Awesome teacher."
1295,2000389,2.0,4.0,"McCurdy is terrible! Everyone including myself has struggled in this class. We thought she was going to be easy, etc but instead your grade mainly depends on her test. She is hard to understand and she just reads off the slides. Also she gives study questions, but they aren't always helpful. ALSO DONT BUY THE TEXTBOOK!!!!"
1296,2000389,1.0,4.0,"Immunology is a difficult class. She seems like a very nice and welcoming teacher, but once you struggle or inconvenience her in any way she doesn't care about your success. Many people fail this class simply because when they look for assistance and she is very little help and can even come off as rude."
1297,2000389,2.0,5.0,Please add more grades to the class! Having only 4 tests as a grade makes the class difficult to have an A. Her videos were all over the place. The PDF would have different slides than the videos. This class took so much time away from the rest of my classes (over 15 hours each week). So many people failed by one question.
1298,2000389,4.0,4.0,"Human Genetics was not a difficult class, but it was made easier by Dr. McCurdys teaching a resources she offered to her students. The study guides were the majority of the tests, and gave extra credit each test."
1299,2000389,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mccurdy does study guides for each chapter and although it's a lot, definitely do them (she also gives out her own answer keys to them)! There are a good bit of questions on the tests that are very similar to those on the study guides. She gives some extra credit as well so definitely do that as well."
1300,2000389,5.0,2.0,Dr. McCurdy gives study guides for every chapter that are very helpful. You only have tests no homework but she does offer extra credit that helps. Shes very accessible outside of class.
1301,2000389,5.0,4.0,Gives study guides for every chapter and the test questions often come off of the covered material on those study guides. Reads off slides but slides have blanks to make you pay attention. Good teacher and her tests arent too bad.
1302,2000389,4.0,3.0,"Listen in the lectures and do the study guides, and you'll be fine. Only graded by the 4 tests and the lab grade but there are some bonus opportunities on the test. Overall a pretty easy class if you're willing to study in advance and put in the work."
1303,2000389,5.0,2.0,Really great teacher. Lectures are thorough and clear. She gives fill-in-the blank guided notes as well as study guides with answers.
1304,2000389,3.0,3.0,"She explains everything, but it is all found in the slides. She supplies answered study guides. The majority of the test is from the study guide, but be sure to know how the pathways happen, heavy/light chains, and MHC molecules. This is a bit more difficult than her human genetics class."
1305,2000389,3.0,2.0,"Her tests involve a good bit of math, especially fractions, but she does practice questions in class and has study guides with answer keys. Exams follow the study guides. Understand multiplying fractions, coding stand DNA&gt;RNA, and you'll be golden. The tests are straight forward from the slides and study guides."
1306,2000389,3.0,2.0,She has an accent but is not hard to understand. Her lectures can be pretty boring but you should fill out the blanks in the slides to study. She creates study guides for every chapter that are very helpful. The tests are very simple if you study. Lab is easy too.
1307,2000389,5.0,3.0,"If you're a freshman, or even just have to take a BIO class, Professor McCurdy is probably the best choice. She teaches and tests from her powerpoints/lectures. You can tell she really cares about the subject. Her accent is also A1. Make sure to use the fill in the blank study guides she provides."
1308,2000389,4.0,2.0,"McCurdy was a decent teacher... Her accent is really interesting to listen to. Honestly if you pay attention during the harder slides you will get an easy A. If they offer SI sessions go to that and get the study guide, it's pretty much the test word for word. **DONT BUY THE TEXT BOOK**"
1309,2000389,4.0,3.0,"Dr. McCurdy made Biology interesting for this non-major. Her accent doesn't make anything hard to understand, and she posts the notes online before the lecture. If you read the notes and pay attention in class you'll be just fine."
1310,2000389,5.0,3.0,"She really cares about what she teaches, and she makes biology very interesting for a non-major."
1311,2000389,4.0,1.0,McCurdy is very good at lecturing and obviously very knowledgable. She also gives extra credit if you show up to class. Just don't talk while she's lecturing or she'll call you out.
1312,2000389,5.0,4.0,One of the best bio professors here. Accessible outside of class and very willing to answer any questions.
1313,2000389,3.0,3.0,"Her lectures were SO BORING, which makes it HARD to want to be there! She explains every little minor detail which extends what could be 45 minute lecture at most to the full allotted time. I would fight sleep every T/R!!! The course isnt difficult. She provides study guides &amp; her exams arent overly complicated. Also she is a very nice lady."
1314,2000389,4.0,2.0,She can be quiet but she is very passionate about the subject. Be warned she has an Irish accent but I never had trouble understanding her. There are also plenty of quizlets based around her notes to study from. The labs can be boring but the lab quizzes can be pretty easy.
1315,2000389,4.0,4.0,Miss 25% of class and your grade is dropped down a letter grade. I had a few pre-med friends make B's. I did not find it to be very difficult myself but I took Genetics before taking this.
1316,2000389,4.0,3.0,"4 test, optional final. Miss 25% of her lectures you get knocked a letter grade. Power points and also gives study questions and answers."
1317,2000389,5.0,3.0,"I walked into bio being very concerned about the material, but after understanding how she tests after the first exam, the rest of the course became fairly easy to study for. Great teacher, great person."
1318,2000389,5.0,2.0,I've had Dr. McCurdy for two classes now and will have her again in the summer. Participation is important if you miss 25% of classes you get dropped a letter grade. I barely even have to focus at lecture because she teaches so clearly everything clicks quickly. Then I just study the study guides she posts and get an easy A every test.
1319,2000389,5.0,3.0,There is no homework and the only quizzes to worry about is in lab
1320,2000389,5.0,2.0,I absoultely LOVED Mrs. McCurdy! She makes biology interesting and cares about her students. She has a cool accent and is willing to explain things if you dont understand. Loved this class.
1321,2000389,5.0,2.0,"Professor McCurdy is the best! This class has a SI when it is not needed at all but you HAVE TO STUDY! She post study guides &amp; I studied those, attended class, &amp; passed with an A. Notes are taken every class which are fill in &amp; she post them online. She also gives bonus questions throughout the slides so make sure to attend! 10/10 would recommend!"
1322,2000389,4.0,3.0,She is hard to understand but other than that really good teacher
1323,2000389,5.0,3.0,"Her study guides are just like her tests. Shes great, has a fun accent, and is so kind!"
1324,2000389,4.0,3.0,"She is a very good biology professor! She is very lecture heavy, but she posts the powerpoints online. She also provides study questions/guides with the answers for each chapter discussed in class. She usually does some bonus questions during a lecture for the next exam as well. Would recommend!"
1325,2000389,5.0,3.0,Dr. McCurdy is easily one of the most understanding and helpful professors I have ever met. Her tests are very fair to the material and her lessons are purposefully simplified without losing accuracy so as to help her students. Her lectures can be a bit tedious but she is quick to answer a question and explain as much as she needs to. Truly kind.
1326,2000389,5.0,3.0,One of the best bio teachers in my opinion. Just had her for immunology and human genetics. She is so sweet and enthusiastic about the material which truly helps bc honestly genetics sucks. She also takes the time to throughly explain things and provides plenty of class outlines and study guides for the chapters. Study those and you'll pass.
1327,2000389,5.0,2.0,"Dr. McCurdy is a gem! I took her for Human Genetics and Immunology, both of which are extremely incredible classes to take at MSU. She doesn't just read off the slides like every other biology professor at State, but instead explains each concept thoroughly and includes great examples. She provides study guides which help tremendously. Take her!"
1328,2000389,5.0,3.0,"She is quiet so sit near the front or you might not be able to hear her. The Irish lady can be boring at times but she's passionate about the subject. Class is easy, just use the study guides she posts online. Some test questions could be considered tricky but it's just memorization. Do recommend her."
1329,2000389,5.0,3.0,"Shes very straightforward and will tell what you do and dont need to know for the tests. Dr. McCurdy provides study guides for every single chapter and also works some examples and drawings furing class to make the material easier to understand. In regards to your average, what you see is what you get. P.S., she is English, not Scottish or Welsh."
1330,2000389,5.0,4.0,"Taken for Human Genetics &amp; Immunology: Based on reports from her past students I've talked with, she has improved her teaching style a lot in a short time. She really knows her material now and does not just read off of the slides anymore. If you plan to study medicine at MSU, a semester with Dr. McCurdy is a must. P.S. She is Welsh, not Scottish"
1331,2000389,5.0,4.0,"I took Dr. McCurdy for Biology 1. The course is divided by 4 test (each worth 20%) and the lab quizzes (which together are worth 20% of your final grade). I never read the textbook but I did attend class. She provides handouts online of the notes so its simply fill in the blank- super easy, If you study for the test you should be fine."
1332,2000389,5.0,2.0,She is a very nice woman and is accessible outside class. She is willing to listen and help you if you are not understanding the material well enough. She posts an outline of the slides online and goes over them in class but does add extra samples in class. There are 5 bonus points on each test and if you know the material then you will do well.
1333,2000389,4.0,2.0,"I sat on my phone every day in class and still got an A. I made flashcards of the study guides she posted online and the info on the study guides was exactly what was on the tests. Attendance is not a grade. Four tests, and a comprehensive final that can be used as a drop grade. Tests were worth 80% of the final grade, lab was 20%. No homework."
1334,2000389,4.0,2.0,"Her lectures are quite boring although she gives study guides that are practically the test which makes it hard to fail. Somehow a lot of students fail her class and I think that is just due to poor time management and not studying. I attend all her lectures, take my notes, and study. I have an A."
1335,2000389,5.0,2.0,Had her for Bio I. She gives no homework and the text book is not required. All of the materials she uses for her tests and on her slides (she posts an outline of the slides) and on the study guides that she makes. On tests you get 5 drop questions which makes it possible for you to score over 100. She is also easily accessible after class.
1336,2000389,5.0,3.0,"I honestly loved Dr. McCurdy. I found this class extremely easy, I made a 100 on the first exam. The way I studied was going through the lecture slides and then reading the study guide that she posted. In class she will tell you what she wants you to know and what she doesn't want you to know. Just pay attention in class, she is a great teacher."
1337,2000389,3.0,4.0,She's really hard. She does give study guides but the test questions are tricky and hard to understand. Do not depend on  extra points at the end of the semester because that wont happen. What you see is what you get.
1338,2000389,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher! Gives two options of a study guide for EVERY exam! Tests Aren't hard, just basic biology! Literally taught until days before delivering her baby! She's the best"
1339,2000389,4.0,1.0,I took mccurdy for bio 1 over the summer and this was the easiest class I took! her tests were exactly like the study guide. I definitely would take her again if I could
1340,2000389,4.0,4.0,"A very likable, straightforward professor. No textbook, everything you need is in her slides. Like someone else said the class isn't just a breeze but if you take advantage of the study questions you will do well. They are very representative of the test material. She gladly goes over anything with you and helps you understand. Would take again!"
1341,2000389,3.0,3.0,"Prof McCurdy honestly isn't as bad as people are saying. I'm not very good at science but her tests read EXACTLY like the study guides she posts for them, that's all i reviewed for tests. 5 questions on every test don't count. Very possible to make an A or B but you need to study hard. I ended with a high A."
1342,2000389,5.0,4.0,"I wouldn't say Dr. McCurdy's class was a breeze, but her tests were very fair and I always knew exactly what to study. She posts the slides with fill-in-the-blanks that you can write in during the lecture. She also posted study guides for each chapter along with the answers. Study, go to class, you'll come out with a high A. Don't, and you won't."
1343,2000389,1.0,3.0,"It's a no from me. This professor is honestly the worst one I have ever had. She would never speak up, so no one could hear her lecture. She also would always read straight from her powerpoint, making her hard to follow. I wouldn't recommend taking her unless you are ready to teach yourself."
1344,2000389,4.0,2.0,"the little freshman in this class are extremely disrespectful. they watch netflix leave 15 minutes early, talk while she's lecturing. like seriously if u are reading this and you are like ' woah i do that. ' then you should really think about what ur doing in college because u don't seem grown enough to handle it."
1345,2000389,1.0,1.0,"she is the worst teacher i have ever had. you can't understand her nor hear her . one day she had the microphone just right and everyone in the auditorium could hear her, but the she said ""oh thats too loud and annoying"" and turned it down, so we just put our headphones back in or went to sleep. DONE TAKE HER CLASS"
1346,2000389,2.0,3.0,"Where do I begin? I expected the short Scottish woman to be an incredible teacher. Instead, I found myself falling asleep while everyone around me watched Netflix. She is extremely boring and very hard to hear."
1347,2000389,3.5,3.0,I took her for immunology & human genetics. She is easy to understand but she does tend to just read her notes. It is not essential to go to class if you are willing to put in the extra work to study. She gives study guides that are good indicators of the test. She is willing to help but don't expect specific answers about what will be on the tests
1348,2000389,2.5,5.0,"This is the hardest class I've ever taken. I guess she's a good teacher, but all she really does it goes through the slides so it gets boring and tedious. I think my main problem was the actual course itself -- it's not only biology, but also some chemistry. I will probably have to use my academic forgiveness on this course for a different teacher."
1349,2000389,3.5,4.0,"With having never taken bio before I already expected the worst, however, her class is not that bad. She literally provides for you everything, fill in the blank notes and  study guide questions that she provides solutions to and plus you don't even need your book! To get a good grade make sure you know the study guide key and understand your notes"
1350,2000389,3.5,3.0,"I thought Victoria McCurdy was a great teacher who was willing to explain the concepts if you didn't understand them. I took this class to fill my unspecified biology area and loved it. It got harder as the semester went on, but that is expected when you dig deep into genetics. I would definitely take her again if I got the chance. Very nice lady."
1351,2000389,1.5,4.0,"You can expect this lecture to taught from beginning to end, literally. She is very monotone so it gets boring and its all powerpoint slides. Hardly anyone I know did well on the first 2 exams. She did't provide study questions until the last 2 exams. However, she does allow you to drop an exam grade and the lab can help your grade 1 or 2 points."
1352,1091079,5.0,2.0,"I've taken Anthony for several online comms classes because she's very cut and dry, so you always know what to expect. Her classes are self-led for the most part, so be ready to work. The amount of work is fair and the content is enjoyable. I definitely recommend taking as many classes with her as necessary."
1353,1091079,5.0,3.0,Dr. Anthony was amazing! She gave very detailed audio lectures and she was so easy to work with. She was always prompt to answer any emails.
1354,1091079,5.0,3.0,Great audio lectures.  Tests are open book and notes/lectures are necessary for tests.
1355,1091079,5.0,4.0,I really enjoyed Professor Anthony for Intro to Communication online. She was easy to work with and has a good turn around time for answering emails. The tests were tough and there wasn't a lot of time given to take them (15 mins for a 15 question quiz) but if you read the material then it wasn't that bad. I would take her again.
1356,1091079,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Anthony is a really sweet teacher. I had her for Public Speaking and she is very considerate and helpful, especially with students who are afraid of public speaking. She gave us good topics and didn't keep us too long in class. We didn't have a final exam and she didn't use the book that much. Take her if you want a good speech teacher!"
1357,1984010,3.0,3.0,"The tests are open note, so as long as you listen and take good notes you should do well. She has office hours after every test so you can see what you missed. The homework assignments are short and usually pretty easy. Overall, it's not a hard class if you put in effort and go to class!"
1358,1984010,2.0,5.0,"This class was very hard for me, you def have to study hard for the tests. If you skip class you won't do well."
1359,1984010,1.0,5.0,"(HONORS CLASS) She is a very tough grader and does not give any extra credit. I took this class as honors and you needed a 93 to pass with an A, and an 86 to get a B. My first C ever! Once emailed her asking for help and she sent me a picture of the original instructions rather than guiding me. Tests were 2-day tests and many writings assignments"
1360,1984010,1.0,5.0,"I would take this class literally anywhere else if you can. She isnt a terrible person or anything, I just felt like I understood it in class but the tests and homework were more difficult than the lecture examples and all of our tests are online so it was honestly just awful."
1361,1984010,2.0,4.0,"Tough class, strict teacher. The information for this class isn't that difficult in my opinion but this particular teacher makes it stressful. She also isn't very lenient so prepare for grades you're not happy with."
1362,1984010,4.0,3.0,"This class started out rough, I got a 68 on the first test. I was just studying wrong. All you have to do to succeed on the tests is go to class and write down the homework step by step. I got a 99 on my last test. The second half of the semester is practically using excel. Go to class and you'll do fine."
1363,1984010,3.0,3.0,"Not the best teacher. I did not take notes in class, just did the homework and used &quot;view an example&quot; to complete it. Understand and write out all the homeworks and you should have no problem in this class.(I am an engineering major). Absolute joke of a class since the exams are nearly identical to homework. I made a 100 on almost every assignment"
1364,1984010,4.0,3.0,"I took her for Stats II. I had to teach myself. I always used the &quot;view example&quot; option on the homework. Exams are similar to the homework. You can use notes on the exams. If you understand the homework, you will do good on the exams."
1365,1984010,1.0,5.0,"She's somewhat helpful, but I'm mostly teaching myself. I always use the &quot;view an example&quot; option for the hw's to learn. She posts videos on how to do some things, but not the specific questions that are on hw's/tests. Tests are 75% of your grade and there's not enough time allotted to complete them successfully. Good luck, you'll need it."
1366,1984010,5.0,3.0,"I personally enjoyed Dr. Ballards class. I did have a solid background and knowledge of statistics before taking her class, but even if you dont, I think you should still be able to do well. The homework can be lengthy, but it really prepares you for the tests."
1367,1984010,4.0,4.0,"This is a tough class no matter who you take it with! However Dr. Ballard seems to have the best grasp of the material. Go to office hours, review each test with her, and do all of the homework (saved my grade). She's a tough cookie in class but is a great person who wants you to pass while actually using your brain."
1368,1984010,3.0,3.0,"Her lectures are so boring. Tests are just like hw. You can use notes on the tests. She likes when people interact with her in class (ask questions, etc.) She can be a little snippy."
1369,1984010,4.0,3.0,"Took for bus stats II, wasn't to hard. Go to class and pay attention homework is exactly like test and can use notes on test. Final is optional."
1370,1984010,3.0,4.0,"She's not bad; the material is difficult and she explains it decently. She can get an attitude sometimes, but she will help you if you ask. You don't need the book, just the software. Because of the corona situation, we took online tests this semester and she let us use notes."
1371,1984010,2.0,5.0,"This was a really tough class. Be prepared to teach yourself from the textbook, Youtube, and Google. The homework is tough and there's no clear help on how to complete it. I had so much trouble with the homework that I couldn't complete some of them. I ended up failing this class, while I'll usually make As and Bs."
1372,1984010,4.0,5.0,"You have to pay attention to class and put in effort for the class. You really need to work through any study guides for tests, those are the best resources. Go to tutoring, ask her for help. She isnt as bad as I expected based on reviews, if you understand stats this wont be so bad"
1373,1984010,1.0,4.0,"I was forewarned to not take Dr. Ballard for Stats II, unfortunately she was the only option for the summer. I did really well in Stats I, and coming into Stats II with Dr. Ballard was like trying to learn mandarin. Sure, its great that she actually makes you learn the material, but be fully prepared to teach YOURSELF. Not very helpful. 2/10 rec."
1374,1984010,1.0,5.0,"She started the semester posting video lectures yet towards the end you're teaching yourself. She also doesn't allow sufficient time to complete her tests, so even if you understand the material, you won't have enough time to get the score you deserve. The final exam is an optional replacement score to pad the horrible grades."
1375,1984010,2.0,3.0,"Before the Coronavirus pandemic, you would see three different things, the lecture, the homework, and then the test which was its own thing. After we went online, class did get easier and you could learn at your own pace. Make sure to go to the tutoring hours. I do feel like I need a refund from this class since I am the one who taught myself lol."
1376,1984010,1.0,3.0,"Not a helpful professor, seemingly punished classes for school being moved online for the COVID-19 pandemic. She increased the course difficulty while simultaneously decreasing the quality of her own teaching. Plan on teaching yourself if you want to learn anything in this class."
1377,1984010,4.0,4.0,"Ballard is a really great professor, but you HAVE to go to class, and you HAVE to take very high quality notes or YOU WILL NOT DO WELL. I screwed myself over at the beginning because I underestimated the difficulty of the class and was sloppy with note-taking. PLEASE TAKE NOTES AND KEEP TRACK OF THEM! She gives LOTS of homework and few bonus ops."
1378,1984010,4.0,4.0,"You need to study and really pay attention in class or else your grade will drop. The homework can be very long and difficult but it prepares you for the tests. Her Tests are exaclty like the study Guide. But she is one of the better professors at MSU, because you actually have to learn the material."
1379,1984010,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Ballard is kind of scary and sometimes hard to understand, but if you go to class and pay attention, you will do well. You will need to study a lot and homework is a pain, but the tests are exactly what she tells you to study. By the end of the semester, I actually enjoyed her class."
1380,1984010,2.0,5.0,"HW takes forever to do &amp; you pretty much have to teach yourself how to do it (it is BRIEFLY covered in class). Lectures are very fast &amp; it is hard to keep up because the screen switches from notes to tables to copies of handouts extremely fast, making it hard to actually focus on what you are learning. HW &amp; tests are very different."
1381,1984010,3.0,4.0,If you did well in BStats 1 that is irrelevant. This class is very difficult but if you take notes everyday and never skip class it's possible to do well. She can be condescending and come off rude in class but shes always in her office and is helpful. GO TO THE TUTORS! thats how I passed the class.
1382,1984010,1.0,5.0,"Good Luck! I had a 3.6 before taking this class. I got a D! She speaks with an accent and super fast. You pretty much have to teach yourself. Unfortunately, she is the only professor who taught this. Good luck. You will need it."
1383,1984010,3.0,4.0,"The class itself is not hard. That said, the materials produced to help from week to week were inconsistent and, if not for YouTube and a host of other online resources, I probably would not have passed this class."
1384,1984010,1.0,5.0,Took stats II with Iva after making an A in stats I. Her class was abysmal. She was definitely one of the worst teachers I've ever had. She was not helpful and explained nothing in lecture. Be prepared to attempt to teach yourself and be able to do the loads of homework. The tests are nothing like the homework. Would rather die than take her class.
1385,1984010,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic professor. Very good material, fair exams, very helpful."
1386,1984010,4.0,4.0,"Tough class, but she is nice, willing to help, and wishes the best for you as a student. She will somehow learn everyone's name by the end of the semester even without speaking to you. Homework is time consuming and counts as a test grade, but she gives unlimited attempts per question. If you did well in BQA1 it means nothing now be ready to work."
1387,1984010,4.0,4.0,"She really makes you work for your grade, but she is willing to help you outside of class. She presents the material in a effective manner, but you must go to class or you'll be lost on the homework."
1388,1984010,4.5,4.0,"Dr Ballard is an awesome professor.  She expects you to work for your grade, but gives you every opportunity to receive help if you need it.  She's very helpful, and wants her students to succeed.  She is no-nonsense.  Straight forward.  Tells it like it is.  Very easy to understand, and her lectures are clear and helpful.  Go to class  will pass."
1389,1984010,4.0,3.0,"Very clear and concise expectations. Homework is due every Sunday by midnight. Once a month, there is a test in lieu of homework. She responds almost immediately to questions. Course is pretty much self-guided, but she provides a lot of tools to help you succeed. All assignments are open book. "
1390,1984010,4.0,3.0,"Definitely not the easiest class. However, Dr. Ballard is one of the nicest professors that I've had. If you show that you are willing to work and care then she goes the extra mile to explain things again. She was always nice & extremely helpful when I reached out to her after class. Just don't come into the class thinking it will be an easy A."
1391,1984010,1.0,5.0,Confusing lectures are constant. The class should be an easy A but her teaching method does not support. A student has to basically teach his or her self with the help of youtube to get a clear understanding of the material. 
1392,1328650,1.0,4.0,"I am not one to give teachers bad grades, but honestly I need more from a professor in an acceletrated course. The assignments are outdated and one site had templetes from 1999. The quizzes that were given looked half finished and made little to no sense. While she does give extra credit- you will most certianly need it to get through this course."
1393,2418201,2.0,5.0,"You grade will entirely be dependent on the 4 tests you take. And on the tests even with the correct answer incorrect or ""not the way i showed you"" work is marked off majorly. You could easily get a b for a test you got 100% right. "
1394,2418201,1.0,5.0,"She is not a nice lady at all. She assumes you know so much information for each test. If you try to ask a question during class, she just says come to my office hours. The problem is I can't attend her office hours due to other classes I have and she is not willing to make time to meet. She also says rude stuff in class to students."
1395,2418201,1.0,5.0,She is a HORRIBLE TEACHER!!!!!!! She is so rude for no reason other than her stroking her own ego. Take the advice on this page and avoid her at all costs.
1396,2418201,1.0,4.0,"In her class currently. She is just blah. Would not recommend at all. Try Ms. Nation, I have heard good things from my friends in her class."
1397,2418201,1.0,4.0,Has to be the worst teacher I have ever had. She treats us like we are 5 years old. She is a condescending and rude to all her students. She gets flustered in class and messes up frequently. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!
1398,2418201,1.0,5.0,"I dont like her at all. Half the time students have to correct her during class. She doesnt test if you know the material she tests to see if you can work the hardest ones. If you have a question you need to email her, she replies in a rude way. Didnt give us calculator access on the final."
1399,2418201,3.0,4.0,"Ok teacher, she just has a terrible robot voice and sometimes has a bad temper. You have to buy access to the homework, but the problems worked in class and the homework are basically what you see on the tests. Homework once a week and test reviews can save you from bad exam scores. Final is 25%, but replaces lowest test grade. Takes some work."
1400,2418201,1.0,3.0,"Good points. On time for class. Gives homework generally related to test material. Negative points. Struggles teaching the material. Most of the time she is looking over her notes, losing her place, and fumbling through the material. Not unapproachable, but generally can't help explaining the material. Don't take Davis. #DoBetterState"
1401,2418201,1.0,4.0,Just a horrible teacher. She acts like a dictator in class. Avoid at all costs.
1402,2418201,3.0,5.0,"She teaches good in the lecture, but let you have a problem? Dont expect to get any help unless its from the math domain."
1403,2418201,3.0,3.0,"Does her job, as long as you put in a little effort I think you'll be fine. She has a mildly passive aggressive lecturing style. Will often interrupt class to tell people to get off phones or laptops (even when they were silently doing so), which I found a little distracting. DONT LEAVE CLASS EARLY. Good with partial credit on tests."
1404,2418201,1.0,5.0,She has literally no idea what she is doing. You can tell during class that she has to keep looking at her notes as she lectures. Does she not know how to work the problems? Try to go to her office hours and she isnt very helpful. She is also very bad about canceling office hours without warning and just leaving a note on her door. Dont recommend.
1405,2418201,5.0,3.0,"Awesome teacher and super helpful with answering questions in class. You have to buy access to the homework which sucks, but the problems worked in class and the homework are very similar to what is on the tests. Overall she is very fair and can make a challenging subject seem a lot more simple. Put in the work and you'll do just fine."
1406,2418201,2.0,5.0,"Her grading is subjective and if your not careful, you very well can fail an exam by getting every answer correct but if you make any mistakes she takes off a lot of points for little things."
1407,2418201,2.0,3.0,"She isn't understanding and she is unnecessarily strict. Seems to take out her personal problems on her students- I've seen her raising her voice at students before which I found unprofessional. She doesn't post her notes. I'd suggest that if you struggle in math, try to find another lecturer."
1408,2418201,1.0,5.0,Very strict with attendance and does not post her notes. If you miss a class or cant keep up in class there is no good way to catch up. Would not recommend.
1409,2418201,3.0,4.0,"Strict with attendance and lab time. Won't take ANY excuses, but she is pretty nice and offers help if you need it."
1410,2418201,3.0,4.0,"She explains things very well, but at the end of the semester she rushed through everything. Need to go to class, because if you don't then you will be lost."
1411,2418201,2.0,3.0,"As previously stated, her class her rules. No extra credit whatsoever, has a bad attitude. If you struggle in her subject Id recommend taking a more caring teacher."
1412,2418201,1.0,4.0,"she simply does not care what excuse you have, her class her rules. especially since it is online if you have no way to get into the lecture and you miss one day, zero. homework and quizzes every other day and on the weekend"
1413,2418201,3.0,5.0,"She seems like a good person, but I dont think she likes her job that much. She moves way too fast and if you fall behind on one thing youre honestly just behind the rest of the class. As long as you can teach it to yourself outside of class or in the math domain, youll be fine"
1414,2418201,3.0,3.0,"She posts the notes (without examples) so you can print them off before class and fill in the examples. I HIGHLY suggest doing this bc if you go in planning on writing the notes, youll get behind bc she goes fast. Shes very understanding. had to miss a test for a funeral&amp;she didnt rush me to get it done and was very kind. Tests are note based"
1415,2418201,2.0,3.0,"No extra credit do not ask or she will get very angry. She has an attitude. Only good thing is that if you miss less than 4 classes she will drop your lowest quiz and homework grade. She does give good and useful examples in class but sometimes goes very fast. Also, she thought problems differently than I learned in High School."
1416,2418201,4.0,2.0,The class was super easy for me. Mrs. Davis explains the material pretty clearly for the most part. There were so many days that the class was only 20-30 minutes long because of how short some lectures were.
1417,2418201,4.0,3.0,"Shes a pretty good teacher. She does tend to focus a little too much on really basic algebra, but thats better than her flying through the problems. The class isnt very hard. You just have to stay on top of homework and quizzes (which are taken outside class)."
1418,2418201,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher, the people who care about her &quot;treating them like children&quot; are the same ones who barely passed college algebra so it's reasonable. Pay attention and do homework and you'll get an A. Humor is a hit or miss."
1419,2418201,4.0,3.0,"she is a great teacher! she took over mid way through the semester for my trig teacher who never came to class, and she made everything seem so much easier! the only reason it was hard was because of the material."
1420,2418201,5.0,3.0,"I took her for trig. She is a good teacher who explained the material well. Her tests and quizzes are very clear, you know exactly what will be on them. She is very kind"
1421,2418201,2.0,3.0,"If you get stuck with this professor, get ready for a long class. She goes through the easiest problems slowly and the tougher problems super fast. Also treats us like we are dependent high-schoolers."
1422,2418201,2.0,5.0,"She treats us like we are two year olds. I understand she is a graduate student, but she could still treat us like adults. She posts notes from class so I just work on other classes HW during her lecture."
1423,2418201,3.0,2.0,Ms. Davis was a nice lady but she went entirely too fast in class. Before you could finish writing down what she wrote she would go to the next problem.
1424,2057753,1.0,5.0,"He taught horrible and barely spoke English, then he'll give a test a few days later on it when we barely understand what he said even if we ask him to repeat. Other than that he was very nice and respectful also he was cool and pretty funny."
1425,2057753,1.0,4.0,"Professor Lung definitely knows his information. The only problem is, hes not good at teaching it. At all. The only way to succeed in his class is to read the book and do all extra credit. Taking the homework to him written out was my saving grace. Visit him as much as possible so he knows who you are. He definitely cares, but wont make it easy."
1426,2057753,2.0,4.0,"He can not teach at all, but he does understand what he is doing. He gives 10 point bonus to your average if you meet with him during office hours for every homework. Use the book to study and learn the information. Gives lots of partial credit, so on tests just act like you know what you are doing, and even if it's wrong you'll be fine."
1427,2057753,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Lung has been the most difficult professor I've ever had to work with. He yells at you for not understanding the material he poorly explains. If you can't make his office hrs, forget it. He doesn't check his email, and he didnt show up to his office when I scheduled in-person previously. I've always had A's but in his class, I'm nearly failing."
1428,2057753,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Lung is humorous and creative. He gives you chances for extra credit, and he wants you to learn! Attend his class, meet with him about your progress, and show interest in the subject. Your grade will reflect the effort you put into it. He gets bashed unfairly. Hes a good guy. Students should act like adults rather than middle schoolers."
1429,2057753,1.0,5.0,"This man is the worst teacher I have ever had.I would rate 0 if I could. He is condescending and rude. He will not help you if you go to his office hours. He offers 10% bonus for going to his office hours once a week every week,but its just a waste of time. He just tells you that you're not working hard enough and sends you away. Avoid at all costs"
1430,2057753,4.0,3.0,"Lung's previous reviews are bad, but he took what people said and changed his teaching style beginning in Spring 2018 because of it. He gives plenty of partial credit, and even offers a contract for TEN PERCENT extra in the class, just for doing your work every week. Fun guy, tries to make class interesting. Do your work and you will be rewarded."
1431,2057753,1.0,5.0,"I have never, had a professor who was so discouraging. Makes student feel like there is no room for improvment. Homework does not reflect tests nor what we learn in lecture. Imagine the lecture is in Spanish but the homework is in German. Does give partial credit on tests and sneaks in chances to earn extra credit. Read the slides."
1432,2057753,4.0,4.0,"Will roast you without hesitation if you mess up, don't know how to do something, or don't bring your book. Even when it's you, it's still pretty funny. Goofy dude."
1433,2057753,1.0,5.0,"Treats students poorly in class when he gets frustrated with anything. His multiple choice questions you could get completely different answers for, and this is his comment I copied directly from an email from him:  ""Do you think I really care what the multiple choice options are?""  I pray for future students of his classes."
1434,2057753,1.0,5.0,"Treats students poorly in class when he gets frustrated with anything. His multiple choice questions you could get completely different answers for, and this is his comment I copied directly from an email from him:  ""Do you think I really care what the multiple choice options are?"" I pray for future students of his classes."
1435,2057753,1.5,4.0,"Not only does this professor speak VERY quickly, but he has a foreign accent which can be hard to understand, and he can be a jerk.  If all of the students are lost, instead of saying,""where did I lose you all?"", he'll say,""what? Do you people not know simple division?"""
1436,2057753,1.0,5.0,Teacher very scattered brain. Does not provide clear instructions. Embarrass you when you ask a question. Power points are useless. Makes you teach yourself the material. By far the worse teacher I've took.
1437,2057753,1.0,5.0,"The worst teacher I have ever had in my life. He is accusation heavy and will pick on you if he does not like you. He does not explain anything and expects you to know physics!! He has to give SO much extra credit because if he didn't, no one would pass. "
1438,2057753,3.0,2.0,"I don't understand why so many people complain about Lung. He really loves physics and tries to make the class interesting. If you go to class and do the online homework you should have no problem passing this class. He is a pretty easy grader, even if your answer is way off if you write down how you got there he'll give you at least half credit"
1439,1771037,5.0,4.0,"I'm a graphic design major, and I'm not super fond of drawing. Neil helped me enjoy drawing and I learned so much in the one semester that I've had him. I can easily see so much improvement in my drawing skills. I would absolutely take him again, even if I didn't need the class. Not too mention the fact that he has the best taste in music."
1440,1771037,5.0,4.0,He isn't like my other professors.  This class is so fun and challneges me to do good work.  I learned a lot. Thanks Neil!
1441,2557474,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Fabel is an incredibly understanding and easy-going professor. There is a lot of homework, but none of it is mandatory (but I would recommend doing it to succeed). She likes to crack jokes and make students feel comfortable enough to ask questions. She gives great feedback on tests, homework, and projects. I would highly recommend her."
1442,2557474,5.0,2.0,"Kate is by far one of the best professors I've ever had. She is really patient, as she knows learning Russian isn't easy. She grades very fair on tests, and homework is merely a tool to help you learn (it isn't really graded). She gives good feedback, and she has a great sense of humor. She teaches a lot about the culture as well as the language."
1443,2418212,3.0,3.0,"I was unprepared for the amount of money I had to send for his class. The syllabus it said you needed to purchase one website for assignments and the book, but then he required 2 more websites for assignments and attendance. Besides the big price tag his lectures are boring but short, assignments and quizzes are easy but the projects take forever"
1444,2418212,5.0,1.0,This was the easiest class I have taken. The tests are online and not proctored. There are super simple weekly homeworks. He also gives extra credit. You never stay in class the full period. I ended with a 99% super easy.
1445,2418212,5.0,2.0,All the assignments were online and you have multiple attempts on almost everything. Our last assugnments were due at the end of October and there was no final. Dr. Sikolia also seemed very nice and would always answer any questions you had.
1446,2418212,4.0,2.0,"I took this class online, so I did not have much contact with the teacher. He sends reminders before assignments are due. Simnet (which you use for the class) is not as updated as current Office 365, so Google is your friend in this class when it comes to certain items that do not line up with SImnet. It took about an hour a week to do the work."
1447,2418212,5.0,1.0,"This class is extremely easy. Hes a very caring guy who wants you to succeed. There are a lot of projects, but its only a 10 week course. My wifi once messed up during a quiz while I was in quarantine, and he reopened it for me. Great guy and good professor."
1448,2418212,5.0,1.0,"Definitely take this class online! There are a lot of word and excel assignments and projects that can be very tedious, but they are in no way hard. You often have a few chances to correct mistakes, as well. YouTube has a lot of tutorial videos on the projects if you struggle with them. The class finishes a few weeks before the semester ends."
1449,2418212,4.0,2.0,"the class was pretty easy and finished up early in the semester. the projects weren't hard, but there were a good few of them &amp; they were kinda time consuming. dr. sikolia was easy to reach and gave clear instructions. he did use campusknot so make sure you sign up before the day he decides to use it for five minute quizzes."
1450,2418212,5.0,2.0,a lot of tedious projects. He was as helpful as he could be
1451,2418212,5.0,1.0,"He is engaging in class, he was very helpful when questions were asked in class/ over email, and he was very good at explaining the material and when due dates were. Same due dates every week. He tried to make the material relate to us while also making his classes interesting. The HW &amp; tests are easy if u go to class &amp; do simnet work!"
1452,2418212,3.0,1.0,"So easy. Literally just doing Word and Excel assignments. Like &quot;increase font&quot;, &quot;decrease spacing&quot;, easy stuff. And if you don't know, just look it up. It's a 2 credit class, but because he had class twice a week, we got done in half a semester. And there was no final."
1453,2418212,4.0,1.0,His class was so easy. No need to even watch the lecture videos. The word and excel projects can be challenging but theres tons of tutorial vids on youtube
1454,2418212,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Sikolia was one of my favorite professors this semester. I actually really enjoyed the class. It's not hard at all. Attendance was a part of the final grade. He has an accent, but he is easy to understand. He likes jokes, and he did not bore me. He is specific about his emails, but he gives you a direct guide in the syllabus. Super easy class!!"
1455,2418212,5.0,2.0,This was a super easy class. All of the assignments and even the midterm were online. The quizzes on the book chapters and the midterm were the only thing that you didn't get multiple tries on. If you want to make an A and turn in all your work I don't see how you wouldn't.
1456,2418212,5.0,1.0,"This course is a required one for most majors at MSU, and as long as you pace yourself, this one is an easy A. The modules are long and the Word/Excel projects are tedious if you don't have prior experience working with either in detail, but Dr. Sikolia is makes himself readily available to answer questions and walk students though project tasks."
1457,2418212,4.0,3.0,"The online homework and excel projects were tedious but consistent. Most everything can be sourced online, but definitely find a buddy or two for the excel assignments! Let one submit it first, correct their mistakes, and submit next."
1458,2418212,2.0,1.0,"The man barely acknowledges his students, if you send him an email with any mistakes it is 1% off your grade. never bothered with his lectures. the information was that of a 3rd-grade class. it's absolutely embarrassing."
1459,2418212,1.0,3.0,"Dr sikolia doesnt teach a hard class, but he still sucks. I would not in any way recommend taking his class. The online tool we were using was messing up and despite me having done the work and emailing him before the deadline explaining that. He didnt take my work. That 1 assignment took me from a 98 in the last week to a 87. And he did nothing"
1460,2418212,5.0,1.0,"This class got moved online as a miniterm and it was an easy A. His lectures are pretty pointless, didn't watch a single one. Just do all the homeworks. They're easy, but some of them are tedious. There are walkthroughs of most of the excel and word projects on youtube."
1461,2418212,5.0,2.0,"Class is easy if you just do the work. Like most professors, he does not accept late work however, he is extremely clear on when everything is due. I suggest, if there are multiple assignments due in one day, that you start some at least a day early because though they are easy, it is time-consuming. Take this professor for Bis Info Systems"
1462,2418212,4.0,1.0,"I took this class fully online. He offered a Webex session twice a week for questions, but it was not required. This course was very easy, even if you don't watch the lectures. The lessons sometimes took some time but it was not difficult work. Tests were not on a lockdown browser and were easy. Hardest part was projects, but you get 2 tries."
1463,2418212,5.0,3.0,Class is so easy online. Finished a few weeks before the end of the semester
1464,2418212,5.0,2.0,He is a very good teacher. His Bis System class is very easy. If you ever have questions he gives good feedback.
1465,2418212,4.0,2.0,"Many people don't lie him because he has an accent, but I understood him just fine. He is strict on attendance and excuses. You don't have to pay attention in class, just go and do the online assignments, and you should finish with an A. You will become proficient in Microsoft programs by the end of the class through the online assignments."
1466,2418212,5.0,1.0,"He is a very sweet, humble professor who teaches a slightly uninteresting course. However, I would take him any day as his class is extremely organized and straight to the point. I would definitely take his classes again!"
1467,2418212,5.0,1.0,"Easy but boring class. Not profs fault though, he works well with what he is given! Overall a super sweet and nice guy."
1468,2418212,3.0,2.0,Booooooooooring- The best way to describe this class and I took it at 3:30 so that made it even worse. If he didn't require attendance nobody would show up to class because you really don't need to as this class should be online. That being said he was a funny guy and he never used the entire 75 minutes of class time. Easy A as long as you do HW.
1469,2418212,1.0,1.0,Little to no help with computershes a computer class teacher.
1470,2418212,5.0,1.0,Great teacher. His lectures weren't long. We had one major test and then just precuts for the remainder of the class. Just take notes and pay attention. Easy A. I totally recommend.
1471,2418212,3.0,2.0,If you do all the work on SimNet you will pass: easy. The lectures are useless (this could definitely be an online class) but he grades attendance harshly so you really need to go if you want an A. He's super easy to contact outside of class and he has office hours that he uses specifically for student appointments. Would take again (not at 8am)!
1472,2418212,3.0,1.0,half of the course is him lecturing from textbook company made power point slides (SUUUUUPER BORING) but the other half is him going through Microsoft excel/office projects. 1 test (midterm) that's online. No final. Overall really easy and kind of boring. weekly assignments from textbook online (unlimited chances). attendance is a grade.
1473,2418212,2.0,1.0,"You can't really understand him but he's funny. Attendance is a grade. Everything is on Simnet and CampusKnot. We only had 1 test we took at home and the class ended at the end of October instead of December. It wasn't the worst class, but don't take it in the late afternoon. Boring class."
1474,2418212,2.0,4.0,"Attended this class every time except for one time. Took all notes provided that were to be on test-test did not reflect material in class. Finished with an 89.6 and did not round. Class was extremely boring, but material in class was easy expect that the tests reflected none of it."
1475,2418212,1.0,2.0,Professor is very boring and sometimes his accent can get in the way of understanding him. The material on the test is not always taught in class and the test are very long and contain repeating questions.
1476,2418212,4.0,2.0,"All assignments are online and you get a 100 for completing them, usually 1 or 2 weekly that take no longer than an hour. There are 2 online projects that you get 3 attempts at, so those are easy as well. The midterm and final are 100 question multiple choice questions and are kind of hard. Over all the stuff he reads. Allows a cheat sheet."
1477,2418212,5.0,3.0,He is a really good professor. He bumped me from a 89 to a 90. Really accessible outside of class. He is relatable to our generation
1478,1074728,2.0,2.0,I wasn't a huge fan of Ms. Remotigue. She did nothing to make class interesting. She wasn't very agreeable and she was a little bit on the know-it-all side. She doesn't have very much business dealing with college students in my opinion.
1479,1074728,2.0,3.0,I understand many people are required to take this class. I was not. I felt that she has never taught this class before. She was not much help preparing for tests. Her style of teaching does not keep you interested. She is awful about returning emails and helping with problems. You WILL need the book to pass this class.
1480,2418218,4.0,1.0,"Dr. Ralston is pretty laid back. There are no papers in this class, and only two tests. You have a writing and reading assignment each week. The class can get kind of repetitive and boring. Sometimes we would watch a documentary or do a fun assignment to have a day without lecture. She does treat the whole class like freshman though."
1481,2418218,2.0,2.0,Her class was very manageable and the due dates for writing assignments and quizzes stayed the same every week so I never missed an assignment. The class was extremely boring and very PowerPoint/lecture-heavy. She shows a few videos and documentaries throughout the semester. Overall easy but boring class.
1482,2418218,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Ralston is super passionate about demography and what she teaches. You will need the textbook as there are weekly reading reflections, but she's a lenient grader and the tests reflect the material that she teaches on very well. Sometimes the lectures get a little boring and there are some group activities, but overall it's not a hard class."
1483,2418218,3.0,3.0,You MUST get the textbook and READ it for this class. There are not many tests so be sure to be prepared for each one. Quizzes are all online and you can find answers on quizlet. Attendance is mandatory and worth a portion of your grade.
1484,2418218,3.0,1.0,"Lectures were read straight off of powerpoint. There were group activities in class, but besides that it was just looking at the slides the entire semester."
1485,2418218,3.0,3.0,"She is passionate about sociology, but the class is not very exciting unless you are also passionate about sociology. You MUST have the textbook and read it for weekly quizzes and the tests (which are a combo between lecture and the book). Her tests are easy if you read and go to class. Attendance is also mandatory. She is helpful with questions!"
1486,2418218,2.0,4.0,"Her lectures are easy to follow, but the exams are nothing like the class lecture. All of the quiz answers are on quizlett, so those are easy. You really have to read the book and ask a lot of questions to prepare for the exams."
1487,2131501,5.0,2.0,"This is the most important class for civil engineering majors, and there is nobody more qualified to teach it than Dr. Howard. He has a lot of experience to back up everything he teaches us. He wants you to truly learn the concepts and succeed in the construction world. There are two tests and one final (all multiple choice) with one drop grade. "
1488,2131501,5.0,3.0,Provided clear and concise details for each topic. Encouraged interpretation of topics and reasoning
1489,2131501,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Howard is an amazing teacher, and all CEs will have to take one of his classes at one point. He isn't just an academic like so many of our professors. He understands the way the world really works and will inform you of them. His test are tricky but fair."
1490,2590258,3.0,4.0,Be ready to watch a lot of videos and for hard grading 
1491,2590258,1.0,5.0,This is the worst professor that I have ever. ever. had. His online lectures are longer than all my other classes lecture put together. He is very hard to pay attention to and goes off on tangents about insignificant things that have nothing to do with theatre. If I knew how awful he was I would have done anything to change teachers.
1492,2590258,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I took this class during my final semester for an elective credit to graduate. I had a 4.0 leading up to taking this course, and this ended up being the only B I had while at MSU. He expected you to devote more time to his intro class than your actual upper level major specific courses. Not polite and bad teacher."
1493,2590258,4.0,4.0,"I passed this class with a low A, but it was definitely a struggle. You will need highly detailed notes, and be required to watch multiple 50-75 min lectures a week. However he is passionate about the info, and will try to help you."
1494,2590258,2.0,4.0,"Boring lectures, lots of writing, and unclear grading. This teacher clearly cares about theatre, but I don't recommend him for online teaching. He talks really slow and monotonously, and requires weekly discussion posts. Most of the assignments you get will be papers, and every test has a full essay at the end. He also grades on a vague scale."
1495,2590258,2.0,4.0,"this class is TOUGH. if you think you can get through with minimal effort, you will fail. he grades very hard and expects you to watch every single 50-75 minutes lecture he posts. all tests are open note but they are honorlocked, with a full essay at the end. dont take this class if youre looking for an easy A."
1496,2590258,1.0,5.0,"THIS IS YOUR STOP SIGN NOW. avoid this class at all costs. This professor uploads tons of lectures for you to watch. taking this class is like having a 9-5 job. He thinks that this class is the only class that matters and treats it like a 6000 level class. If you want to fail, then take this class. If you are not committed, you will fail."
1497,2590258,3.0,4.0,"I did finish this class with a low A, and it is manageable. But, you must have extremely detailed notes from the lectures in order to make a good grade on his tests. He test are open note but they are also HonorLocked. There are 2-3 lectures and discussions a week, and if you didnt watch the lectures the discussions wont be easy."
1498,2590258,1.0,5.0,"I have never dreaded a class so bad. If you are NOT passionate about theatre, and just need this as an easy A DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS. This is my elective class but I am struggling. There are two sometimes three lectures a week. Ranging from 50mins to and hour long. The discussions are okay. Test are based off the lectures. I DONT like this class."
1499,2590258,1.0,3.0,"I would not recommend taking this course if you are not extremely interested in theatre. You will be required to watch at least two lecture videos a week, both at least one hour long. There will also be two discussions a week as well. I found myself overwhelmed by the amount of time he expects his students to devote to this course."
1500,2590258,1.0,5.0,"I am not a student that usually complains. However, this was the FIRST and ONLY class I have had to withdraw from. He grades extremely hard, the first exam was over 10 chapters, he doesn't upload slides because he wants everyone to watch 10+ hours of lectures, and he gives tons of work. If I would have stayed in his class I would have failed."
1501,2590258,1.0,5.0,"just dont take it if you are not interested in theatre, tons of work and extremely tough"
1502,2590258,2.0,4.0,Hes terrible. If you are trying to satisfy your fine arts credit or just a free elective in general dont take him. He grades hard hes annoying and sends emails out all the time. I have never had anyone say anything good about him. Its an intro to theater class and he treats it like were training to be on Broadway one day..
1503,2590258,5.0,2.0,"I took it online and every week he would give us two videos of him going over his power points. The tests come word for word out of the power points. Tests were very easy if you studied the material. He is a little monotone and boring, but it is clear he cares about what he is teaching. Discussion posts weekly, maybe three quizzes and three tests."
1504,2590258,1.0,4.0,"If you are trying to just satisfy your fine arts credit, try elsewhere. This class is ran more so like a theatre 2 course. Youll be able to get an A in here, but if you have a lot of work in other classes then it will heavily collide with them."
1505,2590258,5.0,2.0,"Awesome Professor. He is amazing when it comes to help outside of lecture. Very clear on what he expects and he gives ample time to complete tasks. if you need a GPA booster, take this guy. He cares about you and your education."
1506,2590258,3.0,3.0,"If you're very interested in the history of theatre this is definitely the class to take, if not, you're in for a ride. He cares a lot about his profession and you can tell, if you aren't interested in it this class will get boring fast. I personally wasn't a fan of the class but do your work and you'll pass."
1507,2557501,5.0,1.0,Professor Potts is an absolutely wonderful teacher. A super kind lady who is willing to help those who need it. Assignments and test questions are well explained so there is no confusion.
1508,2557501,5.0,1.0,She is a very good teacher on teaching how things work in the class. Easy drawings and very good CAD teacher. Very fair and easy grader. 
1509,2557501,5.0,2.0,"Take her for graphic communication! she makes the class very easy and passable. She walks you through all the problems, and ensures that you understand what to do and how to do it. Extremely caring and lovely person. If you do not understand something, stick around and you will get it. Tests are easy once you practice, and coursework are easy!"
1510,2557501,5.0,1.0,"This is a really easy beginner AutoCAD class. Mary makes learning the software easy. The class is only once a week, and it only lasts about an hour. She is really caring and will let you leave early/turn things in late if you have a reason. It was a super fun class. There is no final, and there are only a couple of tests that are super easy."
1511,2532932,3.0,4.0,He is a okay professor. Lots of conceptual based notes in class and a few work out problems. Sometimes is slow to reply on email. Office is always open to help students. Tests were always fair.
1512,2532932,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Singh is overall a great professor for engineering. Hes fair on tests and he wants you to understand the material. I made a B in his class. You dont expect an engineering class to be easy. If you work hard and get help from him, he will help you. Hes also very lenient grader. Great teacher!"
1513,2532932,5.0,3.0,"He gives plenty of partial credit on tests. During lectures he focuses on concepts rather than problems, so its not a bad idea to go do some problems from the book for practice. The first test was brutal, but after that they became fair."
1514,2532932,1.0,4.0,He only teaches concepts in class. Few to none worked out problems in class. He doesn't give homework and quizzes in time before tests to prepare you. 10/10 would NOT recommend.
1515,2532932,4.0,3.0,"Gives lots of partial credit, and will curve a test grade if the class does poorly"
1516,2475589,2.0,4.0,Not my favorite. Really inconsistent with her grading and doesn't teach the material very well so make sure you read the textbook. Be prepared for pop quizzes and a lot of class participation.
1517,2475589,3.0,4.0,"She tells a lot of stories and is very interactive in class. This class is fairly easy to pass, just stay on her good side and study hard. Her tests are either very easy or very difficult, so you never know what to expect"
1518,2475589,4.0,2.0,"Professor Akins is really kind and seems to care a lot about her students; I took her online, and she isn't incredibly tech savvy, but there is only one assignment a week (either a short quiz, discussion board, or test) and they are super easy. Really good option if you need this class but don't want to spend a lot of time on it. "
1519,2475589,1.0,5.0,Professor Akins is literally the WORST prof I have ever had. She made the class so hard for me. It was a fully online course and she wouldn't release the assignments until the week after the module that the chapter was in. She never replies to emails and she blames the students if something is wrong with her grading. She is so lazy. DON'T TAKE HER!
1520,2475589,5.0,2.0,I have Ms. Akins right now and I absolutely adore her. She is doing everything she can to take care of us as her students during COVID. She has done multiple mental health check-ins with us this semester to be sure we are doing okay. Her class is super enjoyable and easy as long as you do the work.
1521,2475589,2.0,3.0,"We spend most of the class time talking about current events rather than going through the chapters. She'll make her tests hard if she isn't a fan of the class. When people failed, she'd just blame it on her students. You need the textbook! Grade consists of 4 tests, including the final and one short paper. No extra credit."
1522,2475589,5.0,2.0,Just study the notes and you'll pass the tests. Her lectures and funny and she understands the life of a college student. Some classes all you'll do is talk about current events.
1523,2475589,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Akins is an amazing professor. She cares about the wellbeing of her students, not only their academics. She wants each student to succeed. Her classes are not difficult, just study."
1524,2795079,4.0,2.0,Ms. Temple is a great teacher! She really love the students that come to class so it is easy to get on her good side if you come to class! I took her for Comp. ll. She always do drafts and she gives us good feedback! She is very serious about in class participation!! We have a presentation at the end of the semester that is a big part of you grade!
1525,2729558,5.0,1.0,"She was an amazing teacher. I've had her for two separate classes and she does phenomenal. She straight to the point, looks for new ways to teach students, and she is more than fair. One of the most understanding professors I've ever had. "
1526,2729558,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Schulz is SUCH a great professor. She genuinely cares about her students and goes above and beyond to make sure they pass. She's literally the sweetest too! Show up to labs, do the extra credit, and study for lab quizzes. She gives tons of extra credit and plenty of time to do any assignment. Tests/quizzes aren't hard if you study."
1527,493149,4.0,3.0,"This class is an awesome class if you need to quicken your reading pace. McReynold is strict, but is clear about how she grades and what she expects out of you. Head's up: 4 novel readings, midterm and final, and 5 vocabulary quizzes. Study an hour or two before the test if you are a smart cookie, or the night before for those who are not geniuses."
1528,493149,3.0,1.0,"Speed Reading under her is a blessing and a curse. Good: She is trying to see everyone succeed, clear about expectations, and gives as many extra points as possible, tries to finish up quickly without confusion. Bad: Too many full novels to read, the topic is not very interesting, and book options are very limited."
1529,493149,2.0,2.0,"I would have to say she is a lil' looney, or maybe a lot. You can tell she used to be a HIPPY, she probably still is. She definitely likes althelets, and smarts off to the girls. Content is SOOO boring and stupid voc work takes up LOTS of time."
1530,493149,4.5,1.0,I had her for a seminar class and it was probably the easiest class I have ever taken.
1531,493149,5.0,1.0,she is a real teacher
1532,493149,5.0,5.0,"Her class my be boring, but she does make all the work easy, including test! I'll recommend this class for a GPA booster!"
1533,493149,4.0,1.0,No Comments
1534,2827871,4.0,2.0,"Wade was really great for Intro to Theatre. Even if you don't like theatre, you'll like his class because he is engaging (and funny). Grades include four tests, all open note, responses to the required plays (some books some online), and a couple other small assignments. I would definitely recommend this class for a fine art."
1535,493163,1.0,2.0,"I agree, she was weird, not necessarily in a good way. A control freak too!"
1536,493163,4.5,1.0,"Homes was really fun. We read Into Thin Air and The Blind Watchmaker - two great books. She was knowledgeable without being pompous, a rare achievement for professors. This was over two years ago, so my info might be dated."
1537,493163,5.0,1.0,"She's easy, but wierd!"
1538,493163,4.5,1.0,Test were easy. She was pretty interesting. Notes sometimes hard to follow. Cant miss more than 6 classes. 1 makeup test.
1539,493163,4.5,2.0,No Comments
1540,1762932,5.0,2.0,"She is a great woman! While the subject could be boring, it wasn't because she herself was boring. The class I took didn't have mandatory attendance- half of the classes were lectures she posted online and those days we didn't have class. When we did have class, she had a game that gave you extra credit every time. Her class was hard to fail."
1541,1762932,5.0,3.0,Very sweet woman who cares about her students. Would recommend :)
1542,1762932,3.0,2.0,"Be careful, the final paper is a gruesome 8-10 page research paper (though some of my classmates and I determined she didn't grade on content -- she just made sure it wasn't plagiarized). Homework is long as well. It is a little boring because she just follows along with the slides, but she does give good extra credit."
1543,1762932,3.5,1.0,"Dr. Nadorff is an easy professor - there's a crazy amount of bonus points, a non-comprehensive final, and not a lot of material. However, this class was also incredibly dull.  Psychology can be very interesting, but I struggled not to sleep through class.  She's a lovely lady, but this class needs a shot of epinephrine."
1544,1762932,5.0,1.0,"yall seriously.... do the extra credit, and you will get an A. she's easy, she's understanding i did everything but psychology in that class and i got a 100. DANIELLE ROCKS. her husband is the same way."
1545,1762932,5.0,1.0,Super easy. Tests are almost always straight from chapter quizzes. Never took a note and still had an A.
1546,493177,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed taking a music class with Mr. Brown. As long as you did the work, there was no issue. The tests were easy and the writing assignments and reviews were spelled out for you, which made them even easier. As long as you don't procrastinate and you do the work, there will be no reason to not make an A. "
1547,493177,2.0,1.0,He's a rude guy but it's an easy A but you MUST DO THIS: When you buy the DVD for the class download it immediately and knock out all of the practice tests. It's the only way to make an A. Correctness isn't important only completion so do it in one sitting. If you Do all the practice tests your life will be so easy and you won't have to go to class
1548,493177,2.5,2.0,"He is very rude at times. Not much help out side of class. Grading system makes absolutely zero sense and when you ask to help calculate your grade he will simply tell you ""syllabus"" and nothing more. I wouldn't really recommend him to anyone."
1549,493177,4.0,1.0,Easy A.
1550,493177,5.0,1.0,"Michael Brown's Music Appreciation class is probably one of the easiest classes on campus. As long as you come to class and follow directions you will come out with an A. If you do the easy extra credit, you can even exempt the final. Tests and extra credit practice tests are online and are not hard. Simply pay attention and you'll be good to go."
1551,493177,3.0,2.0,"Michael Brown is a great instructor. As long as you go to class and follow directions, you should come out with an A."
1552,493177,1.0,5.0,"The only review you'll need to read. Plain and simple, don't take him. He doesn't care about anyone and will tell you that. I wrote my heart out on his aesthetics assignment only to be given a zero for not following &quot;directions&quot;. Attendance is mandatory because not attending will lower your grade due to quizzes. his extra credit doesn't help!!"
1553,493177,4.5,1.0,"Mike Brown is a good music appreciation teacher.  He lays down the law, and doesn't take any lip from anyone, but his course is very easy especially with the online tests."
1554,493177,5.0,1.0,"he is an extremely fair teacher and gives you 1 week to take tests online.  he gives ample opportunities for extra credit, and I found his class to be fun and interesting."
1555,493177,4.5,1.0,"If you want an easy fine arts appreciation credit, take this man. His lectures are pretty boring, but he knows what he's talking about and it's easier to hear it than read it in the book. He gives extra credit and doesn't taken attendance but he does give some pop quizzes. All tests are online; go to class and read and you'll make an A."

1557,493177,3.5,2.0,WHO .....Mike BROWN..who ...MIKE BROWN &gt;&gt;&gt;BROWN....hes a good teacher..he knows his material.he wrote the book u'll use...just go to class and you'll most likely get a B or an A.
1558,493177,1.5,1.0,Soo boring! You will fall asleep every class! He takes away points for not going. Gives lots of EC though. He's very full of himself too.
1559,493177,3.5,2.0,MIKE BROWN!!! this guy is a tru **** for real... he gets all the ladies by playin music for them... Gives a lot of extra credit... Easy A for all the homies
1560,493177,5.0,1.0,for sure an A     probably the eaisest class ever but boring and attendance policy
1561,493177,3.5,1.0,Dr Brown is pretty boring but if you go to class he will help you out at the end of the semester.
1562,493177,3.0,1.0,No Comments
1563,2442878,3.0,3.0,"The course is pretty mediocre at best. No exams (for us at least) and the quizzes are easy. Instead of quizzes, we did presentations on potential business ideas. Only problem I have with him is his way of grading. If you think you did great, you probably made a C. He deducts points on very minor things. I'd honestly rather exams. I'm expecting a B"
1564,2803335,1.0,2.0,"He isn't very good @ using Canvas to deliver class info or to communicate. Wished we learned ArcPro in an Adv GIS class, but we learned QGIS instead. 40% of the final grade was a project, he didn't release project guidelines till 2 weeks were left in the semester. Lack of communication and disorganization makes for a difficult professor and class. "
1565,2311826,3.0,3.0,"Though Mr. Murphy was not a horrible teacher, he just was not enjoyable. His lectures at times were informative but other times a waste of time. Grades are never updated so you never know your actual grade unless you ask. Your only grades are a paper, 5 quizzes, midterm, and a final. Discussion was the only way I learned so GO! Other than that easy"
1566,2311826,5.0,4.0,"Really great teacher, only took a few things for grades but theyre easy if you go to lecture and pay attention. One of the better history professors Ive had here. Professor and his TA were both very understanding and accepting of absences with documentation. Seems like a lot of reading, but its really not too bad and you can get by w/o it."
1567,2434714,4.0,4.0,All around solid teacher. Only reason for not giving 5 is that he makes a noticeable amount of programming mistakes in lecture.
1568,2434714,4.0,4.0,"Very laid back. Did not go into quite as much detail as I would have liked, but overall pretty solid!"
1569,2434714,4.0,3.0,"He is an easy-going professor. Give some time for the class and you will get an A. He gives pop quizzes so show up to class. The only thing I didn't like about him was he wastes so much of the class time, sometime leaving the class early and sometime taking almost 10 minutes to turn the projector on; students could learn more from him at that time."
1570,2434714,2.0,1.0,"I had Chad for his first semester teaching. Although I've heard he has gotten harder since then, he gave the easiest class I have ever had at State. I had over a 100 by the end of the semester just because of all the extra credit he gave. The programs were around medium difficulty for someone who's made it through intermediate."
1571,2434714,4.0,3.0,"Mr. McDaniel is just starting out teaching, so he is a little rusty. BUT I definitely enjoyed his class and learned a whole lot. Remember what you did each class because the pop quizzes are usually 4 questions and are solely on the material from the past class. Study the test guides and you'll be fine."
1572,2434714,4.0,3.0,Very relaxed teacher. 1000x better than Jankun-Kelly. Very clear and concise on what he wants from you. When he grades things he's very lenient if you demonstrate you know the material. Would definitely take again
1573,2434714,3.0,3.0,"Very laid back guy. He explains concepts to the point where you think you understand them until you get to the lab and are completely lost. Lecture did not focus on coding as much as I would have liked. Tests are not particularly hard, but there is no partial credit. He does give a ton of drop grades, though."
1574,2442931,1.0,3.0,The class itself is not that difficult but Simpore is pretty much impossible. I took the online version and you only have 4 grades; one homework and 3 tests including the final. He will not answer any questions or emails if he feels they arent worth his time and he does no lecturing so make sure you know how to learn on your own. Dont recommend.
1575,2442931,1.0,5.0,"If you take a Simpore class, kiss any passion you had for French goodbye. He does not lecture, and has not even bothered to give us a syllabus. We do not get feedback on our grades and have one day of warning before a test. He is not a competent professor, and we'd all be lucky if he was fired."
1576,2442931,1.0,4.0,I was one of ten students to take Simpore's French 2 course during the 5 week summer term. The content was accelerated threefold but Prof didn't seem to care. Prof interacted with students only via email and demonstrated an unwillingness to conduct video lectures (recorded or live) or office hours Zoom conferences. DON'T ENROLL DURING COVID!
1577,2442931,1.0,4.0,If you don't have to take him don't. He's unorganized and hard to communicate with. I'm in French 4 with him currently and I don't know what's going on. We have a test tomorrow and we haven't gone over what's on it for the past two class periods. I think we only went over it once. I could go on but I only have a limited amount of characters.
1578,2442931,1.0,5.0,"The difficulty of this class wasn't even from the material - it was from how Simpore teaches. He does not make his expectations for you clear and does a poor job communicating deadlines, schedule changes, and did not follow the calendar he provided in the syllabus - but didn't tell us he had deviated from it. I didn't learn much because of this."
1579,2737859,3.0,4.0,"Overall, shes not a bad professor. However, she grades tests more on how you worked the problem than if you received the correct answer."
1580,2737859,4.0,2.0,She wants you to do well. Was always at her office hours if I needed help. Even stayed after lecture to walk me through notes of a day i missed. Her lectures can be boring sometimes but it's mostly due to the pace. She makes it super easy to follow along if you have never taken calculus before. Only downside is she's strict about talking in class.
1581,2737859,3.0,3.0,"I had Mrs. Davis for intermediate algebra and she was alright. She does have an attitude in the class, and sometimes she stops lecturing if someone talks. The class is reviewing what you learned in hs. The good thing is she drops your 2 lowest hw and 1 lowest quiz grade and if you do good on the final then she'll replace it w one of the tests. "
1582,2737859,2.0,5.0,"Literally just retake the ACT. Extremely difficult, stops class for absurdly small disturbances, isn't willing to work with you. If you can't superscore your math ACT, do it at a community college or online. I cannot describe how unnecessarily difficult this class, a pre-req for any other math courses, is. It's not worth it."
1583,2737859,2.0,4.0,"Very test-heavy course- if you don't do good on the test you won't do good in the class. Attendance is mandatory if you want to learn the material. Gives partial credit! Not a great lecturer, must study a lot on your own time. Calculate your own grade because her canvas grade is not right."
1584,2737859,2.0,4.0,Doesn't explain content well enough
1585,2737859,4.0,2.0,She's aiit.
1586,2737859,2.0,5.0,I thought I was good at math until I took calc 1 with Ms. Davis. She seems like a young professor so that could partially be why. She can be very rude at times and even has sent a student to the dean of students for leaving class early. She expects you to simplify answers beyond reason and is not very good at explaining the material. 
1587,2737859,1.0,5.0,"Simply not compassionate for students' well-being, and I have never failed a class in my life until this one. Things moved simply too fast to pick up, and there was so much that attending SI and office hours just did not last long enough to cover material."
1588,2737859,1.0,4.0,"Davis was by far the hardest math teacher I've ever taken, and I was a math person in high school. She expects you to know things before you get to class that most freshman don't know. She goes so fast in class that you barely have time to keep up, let alone ask a question. If you've never taken calculus before, don't take her."
1589,2737859,4.0,3.0,"Davis is overall a pretty good teacher. The lectures are good and she always answers any questions. As long as you actually show up and pay attention in lectures, she is very nice and approachable. If you have an excused absence, she will work with you a lot and even send you the notes from class."
1590,2737859,1.0,4.0,Took calculus after taking a year off from math which made it harder. Assumes you have outside knowledge from previous courses and goes SO FAST during practice problems in class. tests are not like homework. hard class to come out with an A in for sure
1591,1017542,4.5,1.0,"I absolutely loved this class. He breaks everything down step by step. Attend class everyday, and you are capable of receiving extra points! However, the lectures are boring, he explains everything so you don't have a choice but understand!"
1592,1017542,5.0,2.0,"He really breaks things down in class so that you can understand it better.  So, if you aren't good at math like me, this would be a good teacher for you."
1593,1017542,4.0,2.0,"You can pretty much do all the work at home, but you have to be there otherwise the grade drops."
1594,1017542,4.0,4.0,Okay teacher.
1595,1017542,4.5,1.0,"great teacher, he really takes time to explain things"
1596,1017542,5.0,1.0,"I loved this class. He's very easy and very helpful. He will take time to answer questions and he stays after class so people can meet with him to talk. He may not be the most entertaining or attention grabbing, but I really enjoyed taking his class"
1597,1017542,1.0,5.0,Awful Teacher
1598,1017542,5.0,2.0,"He takes his time in class, which helped  me a lot.  His quizzes & tests come right from the book problems and, if you ask, he will give you book problems to study.  If you do have questions, he is always there during office hours to help.  Highly recommend!!"
1599,976586,4.0,2.0,"This class was very enjoyable, and the only bad thing to say is that the amount of homework assignments kept us very busy. Between the homework, video conversations, and class activities, Dr. Debicka made the class very enjoyable and informative."
1600,976586,5.0,2.0,Mrs. Debicka is an excellent teacher and I strongly recommend!
1601,976586,5.0,2.0,"She gives you some chances to earn extra credit, and she's always really engaging and supportive. She may not be the easiest A, but as long as you don't regularly slack off you should be okay."
1602,976586,5.0,3.0,"I love Anna! She has such a good personality and it a really good teacher. Is always willing to help you in any way, shape, or form."
1603,976586,5.0,2.0,"The online homework is very easy, but there is an abundance. You are expected to do homework on new content and review when you did in class. Mrs. Debicka is a very caring and serene teacher. She also has an amazing accent!"
1604,976586,5.0,3.0,"Shes an incredible teacher, but you have to do your work to do well in the class!"
1605,976586,3.0,4.0,"Participation, Lab, and Attendance make up 10% of the grade, so you can drop a letter grade if you don't show up for class every day.  She is very passionate about the subject and has many stories about her travels that make class more interesting.  She moves very quickly and expects you to work outside of class a good bit."
1606,976586,4.5,3.0,Very clear about what will be on tests and quizzes. If you study you should be relatively okay.
1607,976586,3.5,1.0,No Comments
1608,1017546,3.5,4.0,"Most stressful class I think I have ever taken but I came away feeling like I truly knew the material.  As a construction class I feel like he dwelled to much on Architecture but he is a great teacher, always available for any questions and willing to give as much time as needed."
1609,1017546,1.0,1.0,Just talk about how much you love communism and you have it made.  He knows nothing at all about architecture though.
1610,2442953,5.0,2.0,"Amazing Professor! Honestly, he could offer so much more if students actually tried in his class. Of course the textbook is used because it is a language class. Hard to go over every single little thing when teaching a language. Sometimes he is repetitive, but only because his students struggle to retain prior Chinese knowledge."
1611,2205439,5.0,2.0,"- The course Dr. Junfeng (his preferred title) was project management.
- Dr. Junfeng Ma teaches the course material meticulously, so it is important to comprehend what he is teaching about.
- If you give honest effort, then you will be rewarded, but if you rely on other's work, then you will get worse grades.
- Email him whenever it's important!"
1612,2205439,4.0,2.0,"Professor Ma has a very straightforward teaching style, meaning that he wants his students to actually learn the material rather than be overly challenged and struggle. Although he has an accent, he appears to work hard to make sure the concepts are clear. He was flexible with quiz/exam completion dates &amp; gave full credit if homework was attempted"
1613,2205439,4.0,2.0,Great class!
1614,2205439,4.0,3.0,"Good, like him."
1615,1074944,5.0,4.0,Excellent teacher! He is teaching award winner at MSU.
1616,1074944,3.0,2.0,Hottest teacher EVER OMG
1617,1074944,3.0,4.0,"Mandatory for all senior BIS students...try to take French if you can because he tries to make the class a little more usable for real life. Shim is okay though, lots of assignments and tests cover very specific articles. Papers due every week and a 5 page paper due at the end. All papers are supposed to be single space."
1618,1074944,3.5,4.0,"Tough class but learned a lot.  Expects you to know large amount of material for exam which was half of the grade.  Great global perspective on technology but difficult to understand his English speaking.  Had an assignment due almost every week of class, large volume of work.  MBA class so it should be tough.  Keep at it and you can pull an A!"
1619,1632004,3.0,3.0,"Super nice professor. I personally like a teacher who actually shows up to class. I did not learn anything. Her tests are extremely difficult because they are more focused on the details than actually understanding the concepts. That being said, she offers a lot of extra credit."
1620,1632004,5.0,3.0,"Had her previously for abnormal psych. Grading is 4 test but with a drop grade. Super easy class, fill in the blank lecture notes, every test is online and you dont have class the day of the test."
1621,1632004,5.0,2.0,she's a great teacher! she cancels class a lot and all the tests and quizzes are online. she gives out all the notes in class. she's very accessible outside of class and she's so nice!
1622,1632004,4.0,2.0,"Great teacher. I highly recommend Dr. Golson. Shes the sweetest and also the class was fairly easy. She gave pop quizzes and test and they are were mostly online. The notes are usually in class fill outs. She also used some test questions from the book, but we rarely used the book. She made the class very interesting and she makes it fun."
1623,1632004,5.0,3.0,Her class isn't a hard class at all. She gives most of the notes in class that you will need for her online tests. She also gives numerous opportunities for extra credit.
1624,1632004,5.0,3.0,"All tests&quizzes are online, so if you pay close attention&take good notes in class, you will definitely make a good grade. Some answers on the test are from the book, not class notes, but they are easy to find if you just look. I did not sit down&read the book because it was unnecessary. Never any homework. Outlines provided to assist w/ notes."
1625,1632004,4.0,2.0,She teaches like a highschool teacher. Wasn't too fond of her lecture style. Overall she is a great teacher though.
1626,1632004,5.0,3.0,"Would recommend taking her for any class. She talks fast but she doesn't mind repeating anything at all. Going to class is a MUST for Abnormal Psychology or you'll miss out on notes, maybe even extra points just for coming. Best professor I've had so far out of the 3 years spent here."
1627,1632004,5.0,1.0,The best teacher ive had in college.  She's really sweet and knows what she is talking about.  She gives multiple chances for extra credit that are really easy.
1628,1632004,2.0,4.0,I would never take this woman again. Her test questions are contradictory as well as the information she gives you in lecture. Tells you you have to have the book but has no clue where the material she's using in lecture is in the book. Isn't good about promptly posting lecture notes when she misses. Started taking attendance half way through sem.
1629,1632004,2.0,2.0,"She gets flustered easily. Tells you that you need the book; won't use it in class, but her lectures are vague, so I'd recommend the book for personal studying. Attendance isn't taken. "
1630,1632004,4.5,2.0,This was was very interesting. Class was interesting so you will want to come she even counts showing up on certain days as a quiz grade. Test were easy as long as you know the material and can identify the symptoms of the problem. I loved this class and i loved how she would keep the class interesting. Best psych teacher that I've meet so far.
1631,1632004,5.0,1.0,Class was always fun and interesting. She even let us watch a great movie called &quot;It's Kinda a Funny Story&quot; and we had a class discussion about it. The tests are easy if you study and the notes are easy to comprehend.
1632,1632004,5.0,1.0,"This was like the easiest class I've taken in college so far. She provides notes for you. All you have to do is fill in the blanks in class. The tests are straight-forward & doesn't set up challenging questions to try & trick you. She's the most attractive professor I've had as well, so that's a plus lol."
1633,1632004,4.5,2.0,"I loved this class. Super interesting! She posts notes on mycourses before every class, just print out and bring with you to add to. She gives a LOT of notes and you must add a lot each class. But, she keeps it very interesting. Drops lowest quiz and test grade. Final optional. She gives a study guide for all tests. Didn't use book much."
1634,2549515,5.0,1.0,Favorite biology class I have ever taken! I would take a 6am class if I could have him as the professor! 
1635,2549515,5.0,3.0,"Grading is based on 3 Tests and your Final, No Homework, Posts all Lectures on canvas and study questions for test. Great lecturer "
1636,2549515,5.0,1.0,Love his class! Tests come straight off the power points. 
1637,2549515,3.0,1.0,"Every class was him reading directly off his Powerpoints. He sent the PowerPoint out after class, so attendance wasn't mandatory. The grade was based on 3 tests, a final, and your lab grade. Tests came directly off PowerPoints. No homework. No extra credit."
1638,2705166,3.0,3.0,"Counts attendance as a grade, lectures are crazy easy and boring to listen to. Most of grade is based on a physical activity tracker and she is not lenient or helpful on it whatsoever. If youre somewhat active (walk to class) youll be fine."

1640,132879,2.5,1.0,Got and A and never cracked a book.
1641,132886,1.0,5.0,Does not explain the material clearly. Regularly brings up political topics in class. 
1642,132886,4.0,4.0,"Tests can be tough. They can be so long that you can't finish them, so he gives a curve to make up for it. Recommend going for the most difficult problems first as they are worth the most points. During lecture he can get easily distracted, so either suffer through it or be prepared to try to steer him back on track. If you have questions ask him."
1643,132886,5.0,4.0,"Been out of school for a decade. Looking back, his classes are the best and most useful part of my education. From the real-world focus, to the simple rules of thumb, to the methods for solving problems; my day to day work is easier and better because of those classes."
1644,132886,2.0,5.0,too tough

1647,132886,2.5,3.0,"Great guy......not the BEST teacher, but tries really hard"
1648,2680602,3.0,4.0,"She was fine. As long as you know the notes well you will do fine on the tests, just be ready to put some time and effort into studying. She isn't the most approachable but does her job as a teacher. I would take her again if I had to. She gives a few bonus questions on the test and extra credit if you come to all of the classes."
1649,2680602,5.0,4.0,"Seriously the best professor I have had yet at MsState. She is extremely knowledgable and accomodating, and genuinely only wants her students to do well. YES, you have to study, this is college! If you go to class and study before the tests/quizzes, you will be fine. As a teacher, she explains things in a way that makes it easy to understand. "
1650,2680602,1.0,4.0,"Just not a good professor. She rambles a lot during lecture, back tracks, and doesnt answer questions very well. Honestly, the only reason I did well in this class was when I stopped paying attention to lectures and focused on the book. Her biggest issue is she thinks shes one of the best and that holds her back from improving."
1651,2680602,5.0,4.0,"Hands downs one of the best professors I've ever had. I have never learned so much from just one person (granted I did take her for ex phys and EKG at the same time but still). She knows what she is talking about and explains the material well, she is accessible outside of class, and provides quizzes on each chapter that will prepare you for tests"
1652,1214263,4.0,3.0,This professor was intelligent and prepared.  He was helpful when help was sought and hard on students who were unprepared.
1653,2475837,3.0,4.0,"Chef Vicki's classes are never boring and you can really tell she is passionate about what she teaches in the classroom. However, she oftentimes gets very behind on grading and you won't know your grade on an assignment several months after you complete it or not at all."
1654,2475837,5.0,2.0,Chef Vicki is one of the best teachers Ive ever had. I learned so much from her and shes very helpful as long as you come to class and participate.
1655,2475837,2.0,5.0,"first let me start this off by saying that I am a straight a student. I have a 4.0 and I am a very good test taker. I heard before taking this class that her test are unfair. hearing this, I studied like crazy for the first test. I made quizlets, I read the textbook, powerpoint, etc. it did not matter because i ended up leaving half the test blank."
1656,1066833,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Hall is a great professor. He is a lenient grader as long as he can tell that you understand the material. 2 Assignments for the whole 10 week summer term and one discussion due a week. On midterm and one final. Overall great teacher, and I would definitely take more classes he teaches."
1657,1066833,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Hall is a great teacher, good to have a grad professor that can relate to the students, good real world examples he gives in class. Tests are hard, but overall projects help pull your grade up."
1658,2582353,5.0,2.0,"This class was not very hard. There are not that many assignments given, but they are given very randomly. There are 3 exams. Since I took this class online, all the exams were online through Canvas. There is a comprehensive final. Do not buy the book. I would definitely recommend taking this class online, not in person. "
1659,2582353,5.0,1.0,"Great class, very nice and engaging, easy tests, passionate about his study, gives good study guides that outline exactly what's on the test. "
1660,2582353,5.0,2.0,"I don't have much to say about Mr. Jiminez, but he was a good teacher who you can tell cares about his subject. He spends all of class time lecturing but he makes it interesting. He is funny and there aren't a lot of grades. I highly recommend people to take him for GG1113, but I've heard other profs are good too."
1661,2582353,5.0,2.0,"Angel is an awesome professor. He is clearly passionate about the subject he teaches which makes you want to learn. His gives study guides for every exam, and the exam questions are taken straight from them. If you have the opportunity, definitely take his class."
1662,2582353,5.0,1.0,"He is the best professor I've ever had at State. He really took the time to get to know his students and made the class interesting. You can tell that he is super passionate about what he teaches. If you ever have the chance, TAKE HIS CLASS!"
1663,2582353,5.0,2.0,Best Professor Ive ever had!! Seriously!! I took Angels class online and went home for the snow storm and completely forgot to take a TEST and she extended it for me for a whole day. So understanding and also an interesting class!!
1664,2582353,5.0,1.0,Made the class super easy and enjoyable!
1665,730971,3.0,3.0,Somewhat easy class. We went over everything I learned in my AP high school government class. If you read the powerpoints or take notes in class then you will most likely pass. He is a very helpful professor and makes the lessons interesting.
1666,730971,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher. He tells you everything that will be on the test.  He tells jokes in class, and even though I don't like history based classes, he made it enjoyable for me.  The test are somewhat hard, but he does say everything That's on the test in class.  You don't have to attend, but you should to pass. "
1667,730971,4.0,2.0,"Great course, love the class! Would take it again if I could. "
1668,730971,4.0,2.0,"He is a good teacher and gives you all the notes you need. Also, he is extremely funny and crakes a lot of jokes about just everything. Although, if you don't study for the test you will probably fail the class. The test are very hard and extremely detailed. You never have any homework because all grades are taken from test."
1669,730971,4.5,2.0,He is funny and awesome!
1670,730971,5.0,2.0,Awesome teacher. Keeps you intersted. Give you good notes. Tests can be hard but are fine if you study.
1671,730971,5.0,1.0,this class is very interesting. he is a very good teacher and he will keep you interested. he tells some good stories and he makes jokes. very fun class and a very good teacher.
1672,730971,4.5,1.0,"He knows the information like the back of his hand, tells great stories that keep you listening in class, and is willing to review previous tests. Glancing over the text book before each test filled in the blanks he leaves in notes. If you study and look at text, the class is a breeze."
1673,730971,3.0,2.0,"Pretty Easy, study for tests."
1674,730971,3.0,5.0,He is not a bad teacher. His test are just really hard.
1675,730971,4.5,2.0,straight forward attitude
1676,730971,4.5,1.0,"Great instructor, straight forward, even makes good jokes to keep the class interesting and make things easier to remember, test are easy if you just read through the notes, what ever you do don't show up late though."
1677,730971,3.5,2.0,"This class was fairly easy if you study thouroughly before each test.  Some questions on the test are tricky because he doesn't know how to word them correctly.  Overall, I would recommend him to anyone, but he can be a smart-ass, so don't get offended."
1678,730971,5.0,1.0,Awesome class. Mr. Ammon is a great teacher.
1679,730971,3.5,3.0,"The topic gets boring, and the tests are hard if you don't thoroughly study.  He's very straight-forward about what's expected, though.  Just don't be late to class or you'll get tons of absences."
1680,2713440,5.0,3.0,Dr. Hardman was one of the best professors Ive ever had at state. She was always so kind and you could tell she really cared about us as students and as people. I would 12/10 recommend taking her and I will be taking her classes again if given the chance.
1681,2713440,2.0,4.0,"It's hard to rate a teacher that didn't teach until over halfway through the semester. She basically gave us access to Cengage and let us loose. No lectures, study guides, or any effort put in on her part. She had us give her a class eval halfway, THEN started uploading (cengage) ppts and lectures. She's really nice, just not great at teaching."
1682,2713440,5.0,3.0,She is very involved in her classes and is always quick with a response. For being online she tries to engage with you as best as she can while still making the assignments fun. Homework is manageable and if there is a problem she will help try and fix it. If she teaches any more classes I will for sure be taking her.
1683,1681248,4.0,2.0,"David is a great lecturer. The way Spanish is taught at Iowa is annoying, but David makes it ok."
1684,1681248,2.0,2.0,"really boring, fell asleep in class most days, was not that good of a teacher, the only reason I did well was because I had Spanish in high school, he did cancel class a lot though which was nice"
1685,1681248,1.0,1.0,"Too easy. Did not learn anything. Went into Spanish II with a poor enough foundation I am having to take it again. Homework is overboard, but it tells you the answers to the questions you miss so it should not take too long to do homework. If you plan on going forward in the language, do not take him. If just for credit, go for it."
1686,1681248,3.0,5.0,If you never took spanish the class is hard. Going 4 days a week is a lot so you just have to keep up with every section. The homework is departmental so theres no choice and its really not hard. Tests are hard but if you go to him outside of class hes really nice and willing to help!
1687,1681248,4.0,3.0,"Very pleasant and nice to listen to. Tells good stories and cancels class often. If you have taken Spanish in high school this class is very easy to get an A, if not he's kinda tough because he doesn't go in depth on material. Otherwise he grades fairly and will be happy to help you out with of class as long as you don't spend class on your phone."
1688,1681248,5.0,1.0,Dr. Munn is obviously enthusiastic about Spanish and teaches really well. He's a fair grader and gives a lot of notice before tests and quizzes. He's also very available with office hours to answer questions or to help with things you don't understand.
1689,1681248,4.0,1.0,"Great teacher, he really gets into depth about Spanish and shows real interest in what he is talking about. Doesn't give much course work. Nice teacher!"
1690,1681248,5.0,1.0,Best teacher I have ever had
1691,517989,5.0,3.0,Dr. Creevy is a very good professor. He does grade kind of tough but he gives you so much feedback and extra credit options that it is possible to do well in the class. There are quizzes almost every class and a lot of reading but most of the time the readings are not super long. I really enjoyed his class and would take him again.
1692,517989,3.0,4.0,"Be ready to read. Nearly every class, you will have quizzes over the assigned readings. Also the way he sets up the midterm is absolutely awful. All tests and quizzes are in class. And when he lectures, he basically peaches to you."
1693,517989,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Creevy is a gem. Don't get me wrong, he can be hard and a very tough grader. However, if you properly use his feedback, your grade will improve greatly. He is sure to tell you what he wants when he provides feedback. I would take him again in a heartbeat. His lectures are often entertaining and he provides thoughtful insight to the literature."
1694,517989,1.0,5.0,"gives way too much reading, tempers with grading &amp; does not have a clear grading system. do not recommended"
1695,517989,2.0,5.0,he's horrible. i would not recommend.
1696,517989,5.0,4.0,"He's a really awesome guy. Very passionate and digs deep into the content of the stories. He grades papers VERY harshly though. So be prepared to spend a LOT of time working on these papers. If you follow his rules, you will do fine."
1697,517989,5.0,3.0,This is the best class I have taken! He is an amazing teacher who will go out of his way to help you if you ask. Be prepared to work hard. But if you do he will do anything he can to help you get the grade you deserve! Amazing man!
1698,517989,5.0,3.0,HE IS AMAZING. PERIOD. TAKE HIM.
1699,517989,4.5,4.0,I LOVEEEEE HIM!! HE IS MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR! HE IS SO PASSIONATE AND A WONDERFUL GUY! DEFINITELY TAKE HIM!!
1700,517989,5.0,4.0,He is really passionate about his subject and knows his stuff. I think he would have been a cool guy to know back in the day...a definite hippy. I learned a lot in the class and really enjoyed the readings.
1701,517989,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. One of my favorites. Loves it when students participate in the class discussions. Really digs into the literature. Very easy professor to work with. I would highly recommend him.
1702,517989,5.0,3.0,I graduated from MSU in 2005 and still remember him as my favorite teacher.  Thanks so much Dr. Creevy! I'll never forget you!
1703,517989,5.0,3.0,"Had him over twenty years ago and still remember him as a wonderfully inspiring and caring professor.  Hope he is still into Dickens and the English Romantic poets!  Thanks, Dr. Creevy!!"
1704,517989,1.5,5.0,No Comments
1705,517989,5.0,3.0,"He really tears into the meat of a piece of literature. He shows you how to identify the self and non-self. He is an awesome lit teacher, everyone should take one of his classes."
1706,517989,5.0,4.0,No Comments
1707,517997,3.5,4.0,"Mead is a very helpful guy. He made organic chemistry understandable, and that is hard to do. All tests are multiple choice. The ACS final is not a good time though."
1708,517997,3.0,4.0,"As a person, Dr. Mead is a great guy. He's funny, and he really knows what he's talking about. But as someone who usually does really well in chemistry classes, I barely scraped by in his class with a D.  Maybe it was the material that I didn't really understand, but the class was difficult."
1709,517997,2.0,4.0,Organic Chemistry which is a challenging class but I found his lectures confusing. He has an English accent and he goes fast. He doesn't mind answering questions but you will have SO MANY. Tests are tricky and require lots of additional studying. I had a 3.5 GPA before this class. He teaches at a high level; I'm retaking the course. LOTS of notes!
1710,517997,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher, but difficult. Encourages discussion in class. Great online notes and in-class examples. Didn't have to do much self-teaching.  Extremely knowledgeable, often using over-my-head terms. Most test questions are straightforward, but always some tricks to stop you from getting an A unless you're really good. Not much on partial credit."
1711,517997,4.5,4.0,"This guy can teach, but he is hard."
1712,2738040,5.0,2.0,"Such a good General Psychology teacher. Lectures are super straight forward and very interesting, and she lets you use a note card on each test. all slides are posted online, but make sure to go to class"
1713,2738040,5.0,3.0,"MY FAVORITE PROF EVER! Attendance is mandatory. You will get counted off if you do not attend. Answers emails fast. Works well with students. Cares for her students and their understandings of the material. Gives tests, quizzes, &amp; extra credit. Lectures are very INTERESTING!! 10/10 recommend this prof! You will not regret!"
1714,2738043,3.0,1.0,"Ms. Goodpasture was a super nice lady who did try her best for an 8AM class. Often the lectures were not the most entertaining, but she tried her hardest. The homework was based out of the book and had unlimited attempts. The exams were easy if you studied the provided study guides. She gave extra credit to those who showed up to class a few times"
1715,2738043,5.0,2.0,"Beginner art class, great teacher. I didnt know much going into it but I came out just fine. She pushes your creativity and ideas to make sure that your art can be as good as it can be. Shes really engaged in class and makes the 3 hours go by fast. Super kind and understanding! Would take again!"
1716,2738043,3.0,1.0,- She does not answer her emails for weeks.
1717,2246532,5.0,3.0,"Even if you take the class just for an elective, you'll get so much out of it. Dr. Loehwing, is the most intelligent professor I've ever taken. She's kind, caring, and willing to help you. The work isn't hard, but you do have to put forth effort... It's incredibly manageable and will leave you talking about what you did in class that day. Take her."
1718,2246532,5.0,3.0,"Take her, take her, take her. Dr. Loehwing is truly a gem. She's incredibly educated and is able to relay information in a way that makes sense to those who are learning it for the first time. She's also incredibly helpful outside of class. There is a lot of writing, but she offers revisions of drafts and provides excellent feedback."
1719,2246532,5.0,3.0,"There are no test, but the class is very writing intensive. However, Dr. Loehwing is incredible. She's the most understanding and helpful professor I've ever had the chance to take. I would recommend her for any class she teaches. Her expectations are clear from the start and she really wants you to do well."
1720,2246532,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Loehwing is great. She's incredibly passionate about her subject, but conveys her message in a way that is both entertaining and effective. She's a tough grader in a way that she wants you to do better than what you believe your best is. The course work isn't bad at all and there aren't any test, just a couple film analysis and portfolio."
1721,2009002,4.5,2.0,"Psych of Interpersonal Relationships.  She explained each concept and theory really well and encouraged lots of discussion, all of which was interesting."
1722,2246570,4.0,3.0,He reads straight from the PowerPoint in the lecture that you take notes from. The tests are super easy and straight from the notes he gives you. Just make sure you study a little bit in advance because it is a lot of notes.
1723,2246570,2.0,3.0,"Prof. Holder is not a great professor if you're wanting a relationship with a teacher. He refuses to answer emails, and has a very dry personality. The material for the class is more memorization than anything. As long as you go to class and actually study your notes you'll be alright, but don't expect any help from prof. holder. "
1724,2246570,5.0,2.0,"Tests are literally straight from the notes. This class takes time to work for and you need to study, if not you wont get the grade you want. Holder is not a bad guy, he just isnt as involved and lenient as other profs. Hes pretty much the only prof for BIO1144, but dont let that scare you. He adds few pop quizzes with no honorlock for points"
1725,2246570,5.0,3.0,"Tom Holder was not a hard professor. Anyone stating otherwise simply did not try hard enough or care enough. Holder is difficult to work with through email, and can be very stubborn but that shouldnt affect your grade too much with his class. His tests are straight from the notes and if you have an SI class, I suggest going if you are struggling!"
1726,2246570,1.0,5.0,HARD EXAMS AND BORING CLASS. NO LAPTOPS/Phones
1727,2246570,3.0,2.0,"I had his class and lab completely virtual. There are 4 tests and a lab grade; each one is 20% of your grade. His test questions are very straightforward and come from his lecture slides. There are plenty of helpful quizlets based on his lecture slides. Overall, not bad for a harder class."
1728,2246570,3.0,4.0,"Holder is fine. He does not post his slides (meaning that you must come to class to get the handwritten notes), but his tests are pretty straightforward and come solely from his notes. Bio 2 is going to take a lot of study time, no matter which prof you have; that is not Holder's fault. BEWARE of Test 2 (the plant test); the others are fine."
1729,2246570,3.0,3.0,"I think what everyone dislikes about Holder is that he doesn't post his notes. You have to go to class (or know someone who goes to class) to write down the notes from his slides. However, all his test questions are exactly from his slides (you don't even have to listen to him talk), and if you memorize the information from the notes you'll do fine"
1730,2246570,1.0,5.0,I would rather take anyone then take him again. Worst professor I have ever had. Why are the tests so specific? Why do I feel like he wants me to fail? I don't know and probably never will.
1731,2246570,4.0,3.0,"I really do not see what everyone is complaining about. Go to class, take the notes (maybe 5 pages per lecture, not bad). Study for a couple of days. Pass the test. Really straight forward process. Contrary to what others said, he does not talk fast. He is one of the few profs I have seen to actually give ample time to take notes on the slide."
1732,2246570,1.0,5.0,He does not post his notes. Wording on his test are very confusing. Lectures are all writing. Speaks really fast and his powerpoints do not make sense.
1733,2246570,1.0,5.0,Sooo many notes. You wont stop writing for the whole time you're in class. One test is about 75 questions from 20 pages ( front and back ) of notes for each chapter. He puts some stuff on the test that wasn't even in the notes. Strict about phones. Lab teachers are very nice and fun.
1734,2246570,1.0,5.0,The absolute worst lecturer Ive ever had. The tests were designed to be confusing to the taker. The textbook isnt mandatory but you wont make anything higher than a D without it. Group study session will be your friend. No electronics in class (ie. all slide notes are taken by hand. All 45 of them per class). Very dull and boring lecture.
1735,2246570,1.0,5.0,"Hated this teacher. 0/10 would not recommend. I went to class every day, studied for hours every week, nearly failed the class. I honestly hated him. He once said for every hour youre in class, study three hours. How is that even possible when other classes need attention too?"
1736,2246570,4.0,4.0,this class requires you to take a lot of notes . probably 10 pages per lecture. his notes are the EXACT SAME each year. a lot of people said his class was really hard and it is but i rarely studied and got a B. just go to class every day and youll be fine. he did 2 pop quizzes for extra credit and that was it. the textbook isnt required.
1737,2246570,3.0,4.0,"Be prepared to take notes frantically for the entire class period. He crams a lot of info onto the slides and moves through them quickly. Also does not allow any laptops/phones during lecture, so all notes must be handwritten. I found the textbook very useful for this class since I often couldn't get all the notes in lecture."
1738,2246570,1.0,5.0,"This class is very difficult. Class is conducted by reading power points to class. If you do not finish in time, he will not wait for you. I asked him for help, and he DOES try to be helpful. If class is skipped, you miss the notes. Everyonce in a while, material on tests wouldnt be in the notes taken."
1739,2246570,2.0,4.0,"You must know your notes and the book like the back of your hand for his class. The material itself in Biology 2 is not too difficult, however the way he words his questions on his test really tests your understanding of the material. I would recommend trying to find another professor, unless you are super passionate about the subject."
1740,2246570,3.0,4.0,"The lectures are very boring, just a black and white slide and you can't use your laptop to type all the notes, which there is a lot of.  You need to know every single word on your notes by heart to pass the tests.  Prayers for you taking the class, but he's really nice when you talk to him outside of class!!"
1741,2246570,2.0,4.0,This guy absolutely hates technology and has banned it from his classroom. Notes must be handwritten and phones cant be in view. He gives a TON of notes and expects you to know them from front to back. His tests are very detailed and often have confusing questions. He seems mean in lecture but if you go to him during office hours he is very nice.
1742,2009004,1.5,5.0,"I agree she was hard to reach during office hours, and she grades very tough. Her class makes me not want to teach math. Take this class online with diff instructor. "
1743,2009004,1.0,5.0,Subjective grading. Strays from task and lecture. Poor written grammar. Difficult to communicate with or reach during posted office hours. Overall poor example for future educators. 
1744,894912,4.5,2.0,"He is really into his work in photography! I absolutely love going to his class every week. He will help you in any way possible and makes class very fun. Not much homework, mainly projects and a few assignments.  Only one quiz, no tests. Highly recommend this class and professor!!"
1745,755652,5.0,2.0,Such an easy and great professor. Her quizzes came directly from the notes she provided on a doc and she posted all of the reading so we did not have to buy a book. She was so sweet all semester and always reminded us about work. Definitely recommend her for intro to lit. Her assignments were always straight forward and pretty simple too!
1746,755652,4.0,2.0,"Mrs. Sheperis was a nice teacher for Intro to Literature. It was a boring class, but she definitely helps you to understand the readings very well from a literature standpoint, and grades fairly as well. Would recommend for an easy A."
1747,755652,4.0,3.0,"She is a very caring teacher. If you forget to bring your paper in, she lets you turn it in the day after as long as you email it to her. We used the Guide to Freshman Comp a lot. We did not use the readings a lot. Make sure to keep up with your grades because they are not posted on canvas. I would take again"
1748,755652,3.0,4.0,"Shes ok but she grades weird and sometimes you have to go and talk to her about your grade and why you made the score you did because in my opinion, she could be a little bias when it comes to grading her exams so keep that in mind! Otherwise shes average :/"
1749,755652,4.0,2.0,"Easy class, most days consist of discussing the assigned readings. You can tell that she is passionate about literature! I felt that she was a very easy grader, I recieved 100s on every assignment. Good choice!"
1750,755652,4.0,1.0,Great teacher! Easy class if you show up!! Would recommend to anyone!!
1751,755652,5.0,1.0,"She was great, one of the best professors Ive ever taken. The class was honestly a walk in the park, especially if you showed up. I could write the papers the night before and still get a 100 on every one. The final exam was so easy, I was there for 20 minutes and she gave me an A. Shes a little awkward but shes very sweet and cares a lot."
1752,755652,1.5,3.0,There are only 5 grades for the whole semester so if you mess up on one then it will be hard to bring your grade up. She grades hard on grammar but the papers are extremely easy.
1753,755652,3.5,2.0,"I had Mrs Sheperis at 8 am she made it easy to get up in the morning. She isn't the best at explaining her papers and what she wants, but she is always willing to answer questions. I got a B in the class and although I wouldn't recommend doing it, I ended up writing most of my papers the night or two before they were due. Get to know her!!"
1754,755652,2.5,1.0,"Slightly awkward, but an easy class and sweet teacher"
1755,755652,5.0,2.0,"She was a great teacher, very friendly and willing to help out. Even remembers her students after they take her class. She didn't like the early morning class either though. ;)"
1756,755652,5.0,2.0,I am in her class right now and enjoy going. Its not a walk in th park but if you do your work and come to class you will do great in there.
1757,755652,3.0,2.0,"Really strange, but easy"
1758,755652,5.0,1.0,No Comments
1759,755652,4.0,1.0,"Seriously, if your going to get ENG Comp 1, get this proffesor. Really good teacher."
1760,755652,4.0,1.0,"Very easy teacher.  Lots of busy work for no reason, but usually lets class out early. I would definitely recommend her class."
1761,2549705,4.0,4.0,"Her tests are hard, but if you write down everything that she says and study you will do well. She gives out tons of extra credit. DO THEM. I had almost a C before extra credit was put in. I finished the class with an A after that. She's hard, but if you put in the work, you will be fine. "
1762,2549705,5.0,4.0,A very eye opening class with a lot of class discussions. The podcasts we had to listen to were enjoyable but they can pile up if you don't listen in a timely manner. I would say she gave a lot of grace and wanted us to do well while actually learning which isn't always the case. I would take her again for another criminology class. 
1763,2549705,5.0,3.0,I really enjoyed taking her for this class. The tests count for a lot so definitely put a lot of time into studying. She goes by pretty quick and the slides don't have a lot of details so just copying the slides might not be enough. Definitely recommend. 
1764,2549705,1.0,4.0,"Shame that this class is mandatory for CRM majors. There are debates in the class about topics that are not relevant to the class material. The tests are worth 75% of your grade and there are only 3, so good luck getting that up if you make a C or lower. In these debates, she chimes in and puts forth her opinion and degrades you for not agreeing. "
1765,2549705,3.0,5.0,"She is a very sweet woman, but she is the hardest professor I have had so far. The exams are worth 75% of the class, and they are very hard. Write down the powerpoints before class because you will want to write down everything she says for the test. She does however offer 1-2 extra credit opportunities throughout the year. DO THEM!!"
1766,2549705,4.0,4.0,i loved dr perrys lectures but attendance is mandatory. you get 2 unexcused absences and after that its -20% to your attendance grade. not many grades either so lack of attendance will bring your grade down
1767,2549705,5.0,3.0,"Overall, I would take her class again. I def. learned in this class. She can be boring at times, but I enjoyed her class and what she made us do. Attendance it mandatory, but she is understanding if you have to miss and it won't affect your grade. She grades very fairly on papers and exams. 10/10 would take again and for sure recommend her."
1768,2549705,3.0,3.0,I believe she'd be better to have in person but online the class was fairly difficult. The lectures she posted were just powerpoints with some information on them but not too much. It seems like it's important to read the book each week but I did that and still didn't do too great on her test so I'm not quite sure. She seems like a very nice person
1769,2549705,3.0,5.0,"I took her for Crim theory, here papers were complicated the way she wanted us to read the theories in the book and analyze them just wasnt easy she wanted us to analyze them in a complicated way, but she will help you I emailed her acouple times and shes pretty helpful but is a tough grader, definitely the hardest crim class"
1770,2549705,1.0,5.0,"I have had Perry for two classes. Victimology was a year or so ago, and it was lecture- heavy, with lots of papers and the tests being nothing like the notes. I now have her for my senior seminar online, and I can never get a hold of her to answer questions or explain the assignments. Essay- heavy. She is the worst professor I have had at MSU."
1771,2549705,4.0,3.0,"Good professor. Ive taken four classes with Dr. Perry this one was my least favorite but not because of her, we had a fairly large group project due at the end of the semester and that is what I disliked. She is a fair grader and uses powerpoint in every lecture and she also likes to assign podcasts to listen to and write small reports about them."
1772,2549705,4.0,4.0,She is a good teacher. Be sure to read everything assigned to you and listen to the podcasts. They will be important.
1773,1935307,4.0,4.0,"Rikk was hard. He's one of the finest CS professors at State but he really makes you work for the grade. Although the Programming Assignments were pretty rough, Rikk tried everything he could to boost the grade.   PRO TIP: Make sure you have a good rapport with the TA. It really helps. Also, try not to screw your 1st assignment."
1774,1935307,5.0,4.0,"Amazing teacher.  He's very clear and gives good examples.  His assignments and tests are TOUGH, but he usually gives you two weeks on each programming assignment.  Take his advice and start on them immediately.  He has good office hours, and he'll help you if you get stuck.  Make sure you nail those programs. They're a big chunk of your grade."
1775,1935307,3.5,4.0,"Rikk is a great teacher. He will make you work for that A though! Beware of the programming assignments, they can make or break your grade. Make sure to start early on them. If you ask for help last minute, he will give you a metaphorical middle finger through email."
1776,1935307,3.5,4.0,Mr. Anderson is a great teacher. He means business and takes the material very seriously. He upholds high standards for the CSE department and will not pass you if he doesn't believe that you are prepared for the next course. He is extremely sensitive to cheating and plagiarism. He will come off as intimidating; do not be intimidated by him.
1777,1935307,3.5,4.0,"Tough but fair. If you have trouble with something, he is very helpful during his office hours. Be very specific on his test answers. He can be a tough grader at times, but if you understand the material, you'll pass."
1778,1935307,4.0,2.0,"While lectures can be boring sometimes, he explains things extensively and gives lots of examples. He clearly is very knowledgeable about the material and enjoys what he does.  He is very available outside and after class to answer any questions you would have. Tests are fair and he usually tells you what is going to be on it, especially if you ask"
1779,1935307,1.5,5.0,Pros: - On time to class  - Will give pointers - Shows example code (Please note that he has errors in his code.) Cons: - Extremely slow grader  - Counts off for the littlest things - Expects you to know CC++
1780,1935307,4.0,3.0,Dr. Anderson was great! He was very clear about how to do things and knew what he was talking about for the most part. He's not big on homework but the ones he does give are hard but do make you think. He loves quizzes but always makes sure you know what to study for. He is very good about teaching concepts with will help in later classes. 
1781,2525152,1.0,4.0,"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"
1782,2525152,1.0,4.0,This class was a lab and I had it once a week for 3 hours. Each time I had this it was the most miserable experience for the entire week. I would rather have 3 more lectures than this one lab.
1783,2525152,1.0,2.0,"Ms. Brown was the lab coordinator. Her use of campusknot when we have canvas already felt like nothing more than a scam and waste of money. I only met her once when she was in the lab and felt like she thought we were idiots. The labs varied depending on the TA and the lesson, but tended to not be very fun or informative"
1784,2525152,1.0,3.0,Fall 2020. I personally dislike any professor that uses campusknot other than canvas. Absolutely no point in using that garbage other than to suck more money out of students. Lab was a gamble as TAs were all different on how they graded. She clearly didn't care about students and was disrespectful. As expected from a Lab coordinator.
1785,2525152,4.0,3.0,"Your experience in lab will mostly depend on who your TA is, and some seem to grade easier than others. But as for Ms. Brown, she is strict on rules/deadlines but will help you with concepts if you need it. Just pay attention and stay on top of your work and you should be fine."
1786,2525152,5.0,2.0,I have had Ms. Brown for both Chem 1 &amp; Chem II lab. She is very caring and will offer WebEx meetings and help sessions to help you out. Chem lab should be as easy A if you pay attention and are on top of your work.
1787,2525152,1.0,3.0,Ms. Brown makes the lab way harder than it has to be. The TA does all of the grading so some grade harder than others which isnt really fair. She also makes it very hard to email her. She has a format you have to use and if you dont she doesnt respond. Also the TAs dont bother to email back either. The labs also went ahead of lecture.
1788,2525152,3.0,4.0,"The quizzes were difficult as sometimes the lab was ahead of the lecture and there would only be 1 attempt. I never needed access to her outside of class, but I had to learn to use Excel myself since majority of the instructions were Windows based or confusing."
1789,2525152,2.0,3.0,"Only took lab. There are so many mistakes in that manual its not even funny. Unorganized feel. Lab quizzes are terrible, but somehow easy. Pointless discussion question after each lab for easy grade. Hard to fail if you do the work, but I retained next to nothing."
1790,2525152,5.0,3.0,"Professor Brown is excellent! She was helpful outside of class and on top of communication during the pandemic. She cares for her students. The majority of the comments here say, &quot;she was disrespectful,&quot; but in reality, she wasn't. She oversees 500+ students. If you cannot follow the course and lab rules, you will likely not do well in class."
1791,2525152,4.0,2.0,"Even though the TA's are the main lab instructors for each section, Ms. Brown was a great lab coordinator. She was accessible outside of lab via office hours and CampusKnot. She also held help sessions just because of the circumstances due to the pandemic. She did a good job of making sure our TA's knew what we needed to do."
1792,2525152,5.0,1.0,Ms. Brown is a great chemistry lab professor! I took the course during Fall 2020. It was a mixture of in person and online labs. Ignore the comments on here. She was very generous and offered a bunch of extra credit. It should not be hard to come out of the class with a high A.
1793,2525152,5.0,2.0,"I had Professor Brown for my chemistry I lab! The TA is the one that is present in the lab, but Prof Brown was always accessible for questions via email or CampusKnot. Posts lab help videos and gives extra credit. Our class was hybrid and she was very understanding of how covid affected our semester and tried to help us out where she could!"
1794,2525152,1.0,3.0,"Teacher is condescending and doesnt care about her students. The class itself is easy. If you have any questions about the lab youre doing, theres a good chance youll be met with belittling and condescending remarks."
1795,2525152,1.0,2.0,"Chemistry lab is easy--but this woman is a terrible professor. One time I was messaging her on our class' public server &quot;campusknot&quot; with a question, and she just told me to figure it out myself. Then, I finally proved her wrong and myself right, but in return, she straight up deleted our conversation so she could save herself the embarrassment."
1796,2525152,1.0,4.0,"The worst lab teacher. So much so I'm convinced she wrote the one good review herself. Thinks very highly of herself and loves to make you feel like she's blessing you with her presence. Cant express how unhelpful she is even in the midst of a pandemic. Confusing, rude, horrible all around. 0/10 would never recommend."
1797,2525152,1.0,4.0,"Horrible I cant find many other words to describe her. I recommend taking Chemistry any other methods than a class with her. Very disrespectful, doesnt teach just reads of a PowerPoint with a pointer. And when I say teach I shouldnt even say that. She loses train of thought every other sentence even having the info right in front of her."
1798,2525152,1.0,3.0,"Shes honestly terrible. If you respect yourself, dont take this lab."
1799,2525152,4.0,2.0,"Professor Brown is amazing. She oversees 1000+ students. She is always quick to respond. She is caring and tries to upload funny memes about the Chem subject. She goes above and beyond, and honestly, even though she has a lot of students, she is always on top of things. Go over the material for the class and follow her steps and you will be fine."
1800,2525152,1.0,3.0,In the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic CH1211 was moved partially online and split into alternating groups of who would have online and who would come in person. Ms. Brown created a confuting method of figuring out which lab you had and was NOT understanding when you missed one. She responds sarcastically to questions and enjoys abusing her power
1801,2525152,1.0,3.0,The disrespect she gives students who are fellow adults is unacceptable. We do not pay tuition to be yelled at for no apparent reason. It seems she enjoys the power that comes with her job but fails to see the misery she causes during chem labs. She has blatantly referred to herself as &quot;the best chem professor in the department&quot; but I disagree.
1802,2344941,5.0,1.0,"One of the most kind and caring people I have ever met. He is an easy going professor who genuinely wants to see his students succeed. I highly recommend him for any student taking Ear Training 1 and 2, as he is a light grader, teaches extremely well, and is very accessible outside of class. Just make sure you show up and do the work asked."
1803,2344941,4.0,4.0,"Unlike many professors in the Music Dept., Dr. Haislip is a good person. He generally cares about your success. His class was difficult, and you had to work for it, but if you apply yourself, you'll succeed. He's very helpful and accessible outside of class. He truly roots for you. Can't say the same for his colleagues in the same building."
1804,2344941,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Haislip is a really nice teacher. If you put effort into your reports and the rest of class, you should not have an issue. I recommend him!"
1805,2344941,5.0,3.0,Love the way he allows you to think and feel the way you actually think and feel about the material instead of having to figure out what the professor wants and trying to answer that way for a grade. He was very easy going and great to have as an instructor. Also loved that he let us work ahead if we wanted.
1806,2344941,5.0,4.0,"I am a graduate student and I took him for the first time and I absolutely love his class! I did not know much about French horn but after he taught the class, I feel well-prepared. He listed many resources to build my knowledge, as well as assisting me with any questions that I had. I definitely recommend this professor for any class! Great Person"
1807,2344941,5.0,3.0,Dr. Haislip was a great Professor! Extremely knowledgeable and easy to work with. He treated us as peers and was very understanding when issues came up. I would absolutely recommend him!
1808,2344941,5.0,2.0,GREAT professor. Loves music and wants you to love it too. He only has a few things for you to turn in but do them and you'll get an A. I can't say enough good things about him. A nice person and great professor. Enjoy!!!
1809,2689007,4.0,2.0,"I think Moorhead is a very good instructor for Digital Devices. She has experience in industry with digital design and a lot of research focuses on it too. Needless to say, she understands the material very well and really focuses on what's important to get you a job. Rework the Zybook problems and ICQs and you will make an A."
1810,2689007,2.0,4.0,"She wasn't a bad professor per say, just meh. Sometimes hard to reach concerning her projects and generally felt like she didn't care whether we passed or not. Lectures were hard to follow and boring and if you don't go to class, you will probably fail. Grades pretty strict and if you're not hardware oriented, you've got a lot of studying to do. "
1811,2484213,1.0,4.0,"Terrible teacher, you wont learn anything. She teaches herself as she goes and doesnt check to see if students understand. Then she has the audacity to grade tests very hard and not curve"
1812,2484213,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Linhoss is a truly caring person, but her method of teaching can sometimes be difficult to follow. The class begins with an introduction to MATLAB syntax, (C++) and isnt too terribly difficult if you pay attention. She frequently assigns homework and/or group work. Shes an easy grader; my worst test grade was a 95."
1813,2590715,5.0,3.0,This dude is literally the best and I wish he taught every single one of my classes.
1814,2590715,5.0,4.0,Professor Anding was amazing! He truly cares about his students and always was accessible!
1815,2435078,4.0,2.0,Dr. Joo is a good professor. She is very passionate about her teaching and is an easy grader.
1816,2435078,5.0,3.0,Taken for Japanese V. Expect daily quizzes and homework. The prof is really helpful in explaining grammar concepts and making sure everyone is on the same page. Grades assignments and tests by the next class meeting.
1817,2631691,4.0,1.0,I took his House class for my FYE. It was an okay class much more watching tv and less in-class discussion. I wish there was a little more in-class participation. It's a good class if you need credit your first semester but if you have the option for another FYE you might want to pick that one unless you really enjoy House.
1818,2631691,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors that I've taken in my college career, and I'm a senior. He gives his lectures and makes them interesting. Every other Friday you'll have either a quiz or a test but if you study you will make a good grade. If you struggle with anything he is usually more than happy to help."
1819,2631691,5.0,2.0,"This teacher is so easy to listen to while lecturing. He is enthusiastic in his teaching, and explains on a whole other level than most professors. His class is easy, but only if you pay attention because he gives you the tools to succeed in this class."
1820,2435083,2.0,3.0,"She is ok, but I think she might have had too much on her plate. At one point, lab grades weren't updated for a month due to a T.A. being sick. We had A LOT of canceled classes to the point it was expected. Exercises in class do not reflect what will be in the labs, and explanations were not the best. "
1821,2435083,1.0,3.0,"Her test questions are so difficult to understand, and her notes are awful to try and read. Almost everyone in my class right now does not understand what half of the test questions are asking"
1822,2435083,3.0,2.0,"I also took Ms. Neal for intro. She's not as terrible as some reviews make out, but she doesn't really explain things in a way that someone who has little prior coding experience could understand. Her answers to in-class questions are also pretty bad in my experience, as she tends to not understand what exactly the student is asking about."
1823,2435083,3.0,4.0,"TA's graded the labs which is no good. I got like 10 points off once for using &quot;x&quot; as variable and not being specific enough. She also doesnt teach what you need to know for labs very well. Anyway, quizzes are kinda tough but she dropped our lowest two. But tests you really need to do well on since they are a massive chunk of the total grade."
1824,2435083,1.0,5.0,"&quot;Teaches&quot; (not clear; very complicated) brand new coding thing, gives you 20min (till end of class) to write a program revolving around the thing. Went to office hrs for a problem I'd been struggling hr.s with - she tells me to google it. She assumes you already know stuff about coding. WORST teacher of my life. Had panic attacks in her class."
1825,2435083,2.0,3.0,She constantly introduces new coding ideas then in no way explains how to use them. Deductes 10 point for lack of comments. Labs are extensive yet boring. I had to learn entire ideas online. Incredibly slow to post grades submitted 3 labs before receiving the grade for the first one meaning the same mistakes where made and counted for.
1826,2435083,4.0,2.0,Never wastes students time. Gets through the lecture or assignment and lets you leave. Work outside of class is minimal and the course material is very simple. Tests are easy; everyone in the class did well on them.
1827,2435083,3.0,3.0,"Tests and quizzes were pretty straightforward if you just study the slides. However, the exercises and homeworks were hard if you do not know much about coding. She would just read the information off of the slides and expect us to know how to code the program in an exercise. Other than that, just come to class because she gives in class assingment"
1828,2435083,3.0,3.0,All she ever does is say &quot;um&quot; a million times while reading off powerpoints of stuff you can find on Stack Overflow.
1829,141328,2.0,4.0,"He often would teach calc 3 material (in calc 1) to &quot;help us for the future&quot; and then test us on it-though it was just unnecessarily hard esp. if you're not planing on taking calc 3. He says he doesnt like hard exams and then gives an exam that gets a D average and he does not curve, at all."
1830,141328,4.5,2.0,"He is a great teacher, and you will be able to tell he is really intelligent.  He is comprehendible, down to earth, and extremely helpful...if you ask.  His quips lighten the mood of the monotonous daily math lecture, and if you have a basic understanding of math you will catch onto what he is teaching very easily.   Highly recommended."
1831,141328,4.5,4.0,"He is a great teachers and person. He makes the class a lot more interesting than it should be. If you are struggling, he will definitely help you out."
1832,141328,4.5,4.0,No Comments
1833,141328,5.0,2.0,No Comments
1834,141328,4.5,3.0,Goes fast but is overall a teacher that can make infinite series interseting
1835,2435089,3.0,2.0,Alright professor. Knew her stuff. Likes participation. Overall not bad.
1836,2435089,2.0,2.0,"First semester teaching. After first day, remainder of semester is just student presentations: one individual, one group presentation. Teacher was available by email, but was vague about initial assignment requirements."
1837,1345562,1.0,5.0,He was not very helpful. His lecture put me to sleep and he says ummmk alot
1838,1345562,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Stocker is a really nice guy, but he does a really poor job explaining. He grades homework on right and wrong, so make sure you get it right. The final ends up being four hundred points. If you take him, expect to be frustrated when the notes don't always help. This class is a lot of work, eve if you are good at math."
1839,2476067,1.0,5.0,Go watch the Columbia University professor. Dr. Wang does not explain things well at all and his slides are basically only pictures with very little explanation. The only plus is that he highlights important things in red.
1840,2476067,5.0,5.0,"Virology is a hard class. He did mold his class to follow a teacher at Columbia U. But I found it convenient that if I didnt understand the lecture, I could listen to someone explain the exact same lecture. He is a great teacher. He gives quizzes but he gives you full credit if you tried. Make a quizlet for the information! Study days before!"
1841,2476067,2.0,4.0,"Attendance quizzes. Stole some other professor's lecture off the internet and tried to mold it to the class. When the class went online, he had us watch a professor on youtube instead of lecturing himself. Very lazy. Tests do not test knowledge, just how many random facts from the slides you can regurgitate."
1842,2721833,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Campbell is a very caring teacher. She will be considerate of your personal issues and also during class and after tests she will tell you personally what you need to work on. She does give a lot of homework, but it'll definitely help. I highly recommend taking!"
1843,2721833,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Campbell is a very patient professor. She gives lots of homework, but it is all useful in the end. She offers extra credit as well and is easily accessible outside of class and will try to fit you into her schedule to best benefit you. You can easily pass this class."
1844,2582582,3.0,5.0,"I took Genetics online; this is an extremely difficult class that I do not think should be in an online format. This being said, Genetics is a HARD course. It requires studying and lots of out-of-class work, regardless of the professor. I found Peebles to be a relatively good professor, for online. He answers emails, and he curved the class grades."
1845,2582582,1.0,5.0,"This is by far the most difficult class I have ever taken. It doesn't matter how much you prepare and study; you will still come across questions on the test you have zero clue what the answer could be. If you take this class, make sure everyday you spend time preparing for this class. Good luck."
1846,2582582,1.0,4.0,Dr. Peebles was the worst teacher I have had at MSU. I believe he made Genetics extremely harder than it had to be. He is also very rude and dismissive towards his students. I took the class online and Peebles uploads lengthy and confusing lecture videos. They are very hard to comprehend and I ended up having to teach myself the whole semester.
1847,2582582,3.0,5.0,"He is very nice, and willing to help, but the material is comes very fast, and you need to know the workbook like it is the back of your hand. Reach out and talk to your TA., go to si sessions."
1848,2582582,1.0,3.0,Extremely rude and apathetic. Has no concern for students. The most disrespectful professor I've had at MSU.
1849,2582582,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Peebles and the TAs really want to help you! Study hard, and you can definitely make a B, or an A, but be ready for some specific or even somewhat vague questions on the tests. Tests are multiple-choice, but there are only 25 questions, so each one counts. Use outside resources such as YouTube and tutoring to aid sometimes confusing lectures."
1850,2582582,4.0,3.0,"I took genetics with him and he taught it great for how big the class was. ALWAYS come to lectures because he says things that aren't in the slides or the workbook, and he puts questions on the test about them. His slides are very vague with almost no words so if you skip, you wont know whats going on. Tests are 90% of your grade so STUDY."
1851,1165369,5.0,2.0,"So helpful. I dreaded taking this class, but have learned so much, and really enjoyed it. She is very helpful so long as you try, and attend regularly. She is funny, and understand that most are not majoring in it. Funny, lectures are easy to follow, and always provides extra time for questions. Responds to emails quickly. Highly recommended."
1852,1165369,5.0,2.0,Mrs. Johnston is a fantastic professor! I highly recommend her. She's passionate about the subject and if you do your part by coming to class and completing assignments then she's on your side and will help you above and beyond. Lots of hands on experience and field trips. She's fun too! Great class!
1853,2582591,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Altomonte is one of the best parts of the CAAD! she knows whats she's talking about and she's super passionate about her work. She cares about her students and will work with you in any way, she gives so much extra credit too! I would highly recommend you take a class with her even if you're not an art major i promise you'll love it!"
1854,2582591,5.0,1.0,"This was a super easy fine arts. She gave us Tuesdays off to do our weekly homework assignments so we only had lectures on Thursdays. The homework is easy, and you don't have to take notes (no Tests or Quizzes). The midterm and final aren't even actual tests, but attendance is a grade. She offers tons of extra credit opportunities too."
1855,2426949,5.0,3.0,Dr. Liu taught this course very well. The course materials are based on the textbook. He did a review before each exam and provided sample exam problems for preparing each exam.
1856,2426949,4.0,4.0,"Although his exams were not very easy, his sample exam problems were really helpful for preparing the exams. He did not grade exams too hard."
1857,2426949,4.0,4.0,His exam problems are mainly based on his sample exam problems and homework problems. His grading was not hard.
1858,2426949,1.0,5.0,"Avoid him like the plague, I swear. A lot of the material he gives seems ok until you get to the test and it turns out it was nothing like what you studied. Also used a different grading system than what was on canvas which is absoultely idiotic. Avoid at all costs."
1859,2426949,2.0,5.0,"The problems don't at first glance seem relevant to the material. This makes the class even more difficult than it already is. If Dr. Liu explained how this was related to the subject at hand, that would probably help. Lectures also do not have enough examples to help me understand the concepts. He does give plenty of material before a test though."
1860,2738272,4.0,2.0,"He is a very off the wall guy but really likable. Will go off on random tangents about what he thinks about what is going on in the world, so classes that could easily finish in 20 minutes last about 45-60 minutes. Course load was very manageable and pretty easy. He is not a hard grader at all, so just do your work and you will have an easy A"
1861,2295939,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Holmes is amazing. She is very friendly and approachable and gives great lectures. She is happy to help outside of class and is very lenient on giving extensions on assignments as long as you have any legitimate reason. There is a big final paper and a final exam, but she grades those super easy."
1862,2295939,5.0,4.0,"This course is extremely enjoying if you looking into a political field post-grad, or even if youre not. Dr. Holmes is extremely approachable and will set aside time to insure you are well equipped for success. Trust me when I say youll do well if you go to lecture and do the outside readings (its really not that much extra work, I promise)."
1863,2295939,2.0,5.0,Dont be fooled. After the first chapter the course title has nothing to do with the content. It is not about comparing government styles or anything you might think of as comparative politics. Its primarily a study of the book authors (and Dr. Holmes) partisan views. Very easy to tell what her political party is. Did not learn much.
1864,2295939,5.0,3.0,"She is big on participation and offers extra credit the more you participate, but this class is my favorite online lecture. If you participate and listen, the class won't be hard and you should have an A. Short weekly quizzes that are multiple choice or fill the blank. Midterm is split between free response and multiple choice."
1865,2295939,5.0,4.0,"She is funny, passionate, and accessible outside of class. She expects a lot from her students; however, if you go to class and listen, you will be prepared. Although attendance is not graded, go to class because test questions come from lecture. You do have to read the text book and there are pop quizzes on it, but she will give extra credit."
1866,2295939,5.0,4.0,"Attendance isn't required, but I highly recommend it. Lectures are interesting, and she is very nice and easy to like. There are pop quizzes based on the weekly reading out of the text book and outside articles. Overall, great class! 10/10 would take again."
1867,2295939,5.0,3.0,"I have taken Dr. Holmes for four consecutive semesters in 1000-4000 level classes. As long as you DO THE READINGS, participate in class, ask questions when you have them, and get to know her, you should get an A. Dr. Holmes cares about the success of her students on a personal and academic level. She has made a point to be a source of support."
1868,2295939,5.0,4.0,"get ready to read, there will be 5 pop quizzes spread out through the semester and she gives extra credit but you will have to work for it."
1869,2295939,2.0,4.0,I didnt know anything she was talking about all semester. This is a 1000 level class and she treated it like an upper division class. Attendance isnt mandatory but the 3 tones i skipped were pop quiz days.
1870,2295939,5.0,4.0,"Probably my favorite professor at MSU. Dr. Holmes is passionate and considerate, and provides helpful feedback. This class had pop-quizzes and heavy reading, but her grading is not super harsh as long as you do read the textbook. Attendance is not mandatory, but it would be extremely hard to catch up if you miss class."
1871,2320525,5.0,1.0,"2 group projects, she picks the group. nothing hard. hardest thing we did was multiply fractions. super easy class, she's a great teacher that walks you through everything so simply."
1872,1198268,1.0,4.0,"in class notes are completely different from what is taught in the book, and he can not answer any questions about the notes when asked. a lot of homework on material that isn't covered in class. Tests aren't too bad. would not recommend. He's a nice guy but one of the worst professor's I've had."
1873,1198268,1.0,4.0,"One of the least competent professors I have ever had. Never taught lessons, but went straight into examples (never explaining himself). Could not answer any questions that were asked.  Recommended students buy one book, but taught out of an entirely different one. Tests do no reflect any material he claims to have ""taught."" Would never take again."
1874,2746600,5.0,2.0,Great English teacher
1875,2746600,5.0,3.0,Exceptional instructor. Really connects with students and makes learning really enjoyable. 
1876,1911026,5.0,2.0,"The most chill professor at Mississippi State. Attendance isn't mandatory, and he honestly doesn't care if you come to class just as long as you complete the homework (which isn't a lot). Tests aren't the easiest but he's willing to help you outside of class if needed. TAKE THIS MAN!!!"
1877,1911026,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Hammond is an awesome guy. Tons of extra credit, unlimited quiz attempts, easy and non-proctored exams, and all course content has been provided free (no book). This has been a diamond in the rough amid the pandemic. I'm sure It isn't much harder in person since things should be normal by the fall, but 10/10 recommend."
1878,1911026,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Hammond was awesome. He is a younger guy, fresh out of college i believe. Some of his lectures are really funny and he super laid back. He gives the material to study the class before. Just come to most of the classes, do homework and then study maybe 30 mins and you will for sure pass with an A."
1879,1911026,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Hammond is a cool, young guy. He would do anything in the world to help his students out. He always responds with email Ina reasonable amount of time. His TA takes attendance everyday, but he has a relaxed attendance policy. He gives study guides that are almost like the test and brings candy to class often! Highly recommend him! "
1880,1911026,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Hammond was a great teacher. He enjoys the subject and has really open office hours to help prep for tests or review them after. Tests are all mc, so not that hard. He also has an awesome office mate and one of his other doctoral students in the office across from him is really nice. Not the one in a suit though."
1881,1886459,1.0,3.0,"This is prolly the worst and most unorganized class Ive ever taken. He did not use canvas and all assignments were done over email. You wont be able to keep up with your grade because he doesnt put grades in canvas, so if your final grade average is bad then youre out of luck because he doesnt email back. We Barely learned anything."
1882,1886459,1.0,1.0,"I indicated that I wouldn't take this professor again, and I wouldn't... if I had a choice. I'm a Classics major, so I have to have Greek I-IV. Luckily, I had Dr. DiGiulio for Greek I, and I learned a lot. I've had Clark for Greek II and now III, and he's teaching Greek IV next semester. I've learned NOTHING because he doesn't teach."
1883,1886459,3.0,3.0,Fairly easy; quizzes almost every week. He'll randomly give bonus points so be sure to go to class.
1884,1886460,4.0,3.0,"I love Evan.Yes he goes off on tangents and doesn't finish the material and his tests are hard.But he is a great professor that really wants you to understand the material.He's your only choice for cell bio but don't be scared.He's cool.Gave an extra credit quiz at end of the semester, plus a syllabus quiz.Gave 10 extra points on Exam 3 just cause."
1885,1886460,1.0,3.0,Your only grades are 3 exams. He talks more than he teaches and has to remind you of his political beliefs every 2 seconds. Anytime his name is mentioned on campus every student in your vicinity sighs.
1886,1886460,2.0,4.0,"Buy his book and the textbook and then don't stress about attending lecture (go to SI). All the lecture slides are in his book. He gets way off topic 24/7. There's 4 test grades and an extra credit syllabus quiz (take it). He words the test questions weird so watch that. When he says ""don't just memorize -- understand the material"" he's not lying. "
1887,1886460,1.0,4.0,Applied to wrong professor
1888,1886460,1.0,3.0,"Lectures are so boring and he never gets through the material. Most of the time he just goes off on tangents. Tests are multiple choice, but difficult because of the way he words things."
1889,1886460,1.0,5.0,"Does not prepare you for exams, has a huge superiority complex, and makes fun of the University constantly. Hates the south and frequently brags about being from Califonia. Does not respond politely to emails, even if you are polite to him. Only got a B because I reviewed the materials constantly and got a tutor outside of class."
1890,1886460,1.0,5.0,Absolutely obnoxious. The worst professor Ive ever had. All he teaches is what we already have in our text books. He recommends we watch vids on what hes lecturing to us. If he was doing a good enough job we shouldnt have to watch videos to understand. If I were him I would have retired before I ever started.
1891,1886460,1.0,2.0,"Just don't even go to class. Find some poor soul that actually bought his notetaking manual and borrow it from them, study the night before the test, and you'll get a B. His lectures are extremely boring and the class's content is just about cells and nothing relevant to everyday life."
1892,1886460,4.0,4.0,Took Kaplan for online Cell Bio. Solid professor. The issues that students have with him can be solved by just taking him for an online summer course (if still available). Passing highly depends on whether you understand his PPTs or not. If you do not take notes you will fail 100%.
1893,1886460,1.0,5.0,"He literally sucks. He rambles in class about nonsense things and honestly does not care about his students (at least it doesn't seem like it). I never tried so hard in a class, especially a gen ed. He made me hate science overall and changed my major because of him. His mandatory manual is just a way for him to make pocket money. "
1894,1886460,4.0,4.0,He definitely knows what he is talking about. Gives good examples in class. Tests are hard because of the way he words the questions. He makes it to where you have to really understand the material and think on tests. Not just memorization. GO TO S.I. SESSIONS! They're super helpful.
1895,1886460,3.0,3.0,Kaplan mostly just reads off slides that are only available if you buy his book from a bookstore. During class he just reads off the slides and gets off topic. He's a decent lecturer but I skipped a decent amount of class and studied using the book. Exams are harder than other bio classes but not terrible. Offered extra credit quiz. 
1896,1886460,4.0,2.0,Gets off topic easily but gives great examples to understand the content
1897,1886460,2.0,3.0,"Kaplan tries to structure his class to rat out the slacker students. If you don't pay $45 bucks for his custom notebook, you cannot access the lecture materials in any way. The lab is also dehumanizing, counting kernels of corn on an ear, putting beads in a jar. Also the lab notebook is $90, and they don't grade it. Not horrible, but unoptimal fs"
1898,1886460,4.0,4.0,"He tells you at the beginning of the semester that it is ok to call him an a**hole to his face. Take him up on this offer, it's the most generous he will be. The concepts are not too hard but the tests will be. Very few grades, one extra credit quiz. Use youtube to learn the concepts. Some of the test questions are given in SI take advantage of it."
1899,1886460,3.0,3.0,"I like Professor Kaplan as a teacher. I had to buy a book that had all the PowerPoint slides in it, so if you miss class, you still have the slides, but he goes in-depth in class. Sometimes he gets off topic and goes past time for a couple of minutes (which is aggravating if I have a class right after) but he is a good teacher, and I recommend. "
1900,1886460,2.0,5.0,"He is one of those professors who tries to weed out the students who dont try. Im a criminology major but still have to take Bio. What should normally be a simple, rather easy class, has been made hard by Evan. You must understand his material not memorize it he says. And hes right you will fail unless you understand. Just study A LOT. 4 exams"
1901,1886460,1.0,5.0,Im taking him for cell biology. He is God awful. He gets off on random tangents every 5 seconds and his tests are all unrealistically hard. Some of the Si sessions were good but that's about it. Also it was a wonderful feeling when he insulted all pre-vet majors as pre-vet.
1902,1886460,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Kaplan is a funny guy, and he will make lots of jokes during lecture. He can sometimes come off as a smart *bleep but is usually pretty nice. The material for cell bio can be a little confusing, and sometimes he can make it more confusing. Best advice is to buy his note manual and go through it yourself if confused. Text book is online for free"
1903,1886460,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE HIM! You will fail. There is no way to pass the class even if you understand the material. His tests are awful and everyone has to retake his class at least once over something as simple as basic biology. If you aren’t a bio major pick a different class. He doesn’t care about you. The lab is easy though. 
1904,1886460,3.0,3.0,"He is very opinionated, but still makes jokes in class. Studying is simply all this course requires to make an A."
1905,1886460,5.0,3.0,"Kaplans a great guy! He made class interesting, but BEWARE you need to understand the material, not just memorize. It wont help you, I made As on 3 tests and a high B on 1 test. Do you what to paid to do and you should be fine."
1906,1886460,4.0,2.0,"Quizlet will be your friend in this class. Search his name and your course, and a lot of good ones will pop up. Buy the note manual and read back through it when you have a few minutes of free time. If you're having trouble with concepts, youtube videos can also be helpful."
1907,1886460,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Kaplan is a very good professor, and I highly recommend him to anyone. He explains the material thoroughly, and he provides many examples for extra support when explaining certain topics. Students' grades are based on four tests and two optional extra credit quizzes. My advice is to take your own notes to help with understanding."
1908,1886460,3.0,3.0,"Kaplan is a great professor. Explained things well and sometimes got sidetracked on other thoughts which made the class more fun. One thing is that his tests are very confusing and the only grades in his class are tests. There are also no curves for the tests. If you have an 89.99%, he will not round it up to an A."
1909,1886460,4.0,4.0,"A lot of people complain about Dr. Kaplan, but he is not bad. His class is just hard. The only grades are 4 tests and the lab. However, he gives extra credit quizzes that make a big impact on your grade. Make sure to buy the note manual. He really is a great teacher and explains the content well. If you go to class and study, you can make an A."
1910,1886460,4.0,5.0,He doesnt curve and his tests can be confusing. I did the best on the final though! He gets sidetracked with random tangents but theyre pretty entertaining. I recommend buying the note manual.
1911,1886460,4.0,4.0,"Some people hated Kaplan (Evan, as he asks us to call him ?), but I personally found him hilarious because of his random rants every. single. class. DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOK. You don't need it because all of his lectures come straight from the notebook, which you do need to buy. Make sure you study for all the tests because that is the entire grade."
1912,1886460,2.0,4.0,"Kaplan only gives 4 test and 2 extra credit quizzes, if you do bad on the first exam theres no bringing your grade up to the A we all want. Biology and chemistry was very hard for me to take in the same semester so i dont recommend. Theres also a lab grade added in which was very easy. His lectures get really off track so be ready to teach yourself"
1913,1886460,1.0,5.0,i got an 89.97 in the class as my final grade and he doesnt round up so i ruined my 4.0 gpa
1914,1886460,3.0,3.0,easy class and content. basic biology. 4 tests and 2 extra credit quizzes. Have to go to class but you don't need the textbook. Evan is an interesting professor. get ready to hear his rants for 20 mins of class. He is always behind his syllabus but he will never test you on anything not said in class. Really nice guy just a little strange at first.
1915,1886460,1.0,4.0,"Kaplan teaches a course that should be easy, but if youre taking it from him, is very difficult. He gets off topic very easily and doesnt teach the material effectively. My only saving grace was my lab grade. Theres only 4 tests for the entire semester so what you get in those is your grade. I would absolutely not take a course of his again."
1916,1886460,4.0,4.0,Kaplan is a pretty solid professor when it comes to biology at Mississippi state.  Having him for bio 1 definitely helped me prepare for this class and understand his teaching style.  He is very lecture heavy and only grades you off of 4 exams and 4 quizzes so be sure to study well. The tests are a little difficult but the quizzes are pretty easy.
1917,1886460,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Kaplan is a pretty solid teacher. He explains concepts super clearly and detailed in lectures, and gives a lot of examples that will be on the test, so attendance is definitely mandatory to pass. The class is graded on 4 multiple-choice tests and 2 extra credit quizzes, with the tests being pretty tricky at times. Overall a good teacher though."
1918,1886460,2.0,5.0,"All he does is read from powerpoints which is not cool at all. He also gives us tests off of lecture notes which most of the time isn't accurate. He sometimes doesn't talk about biology, he talks more about football than anything like dude seriously?"
1919,1886460,3.0,3.0,"Your grade consists of 4 tests, 2 extra credit quizzes, and a lab portion that weighs the same as one test. If youve taken bio in high school and paid at least a small amount of attention, you should be ok. If you fail, you probably deserve it. He goes on millions of confusing rants, wastes class time, and gets surprised when were units behind."
1920,1886460,3.0,4.0,So going into this class I was worried by the other ratings but honestly Kaplans class wasnt awful. You NEED to go to class. You will only have 4 exams with the 4th exam counting as your final exam. You definitely need the lecture book but dont buy the one online. I never used it. Tbh hes rude sometimes but hes not the worst.
1921,1886460,4.0,4.0,"Pretty chill dude, but tests are tricky so prepare yourself for that. Attendance not mandatory and no homework. My only concern is that we are slightly behind the other Bio 1 Classes and may not be as prepared for Bio 2 as they are. Very solid choice tho"
1922,1886460,1.0,5.0,only grades are the 4 tests given
1923,1886460,4.0,5.0,He has 2 extra credit assignments and 4 tests and that is what your grade is made up from. You have to attend lectures to know the examples also join the SI Sessions (they help). His tests are pretty tricky and also pays attention to the labs because they will also be on the test. He is very strict with his grading criteria and very helpful.
1924,1886460,3.0,4.0,"Take him online! If you had a horrible biology teacher take him in person. He goes on rants. He means well but it was a waste of time during the rants. Buy the manual, I bought mine off EBay, much cheaper. The article quizzes are easy!! Read the article twice and if you print it, you get to have it during your quiz. Study a few days before test."
1925,1886460,4.0,2.0,"Kaplan is a good teacher, and you will do fine if you go to class and pay attention. Quizlets are very useful for test preparation. He does tend to go on rants for about 20 minutes each class, so get ready for that. Buy his note manual and studying will be easy."
1926,1886460,3.0,3.0,"He was a good professor, but he was very strict when it came to makeup policies. He uses honor lock but does not show sympathy if there is anything that happens with technology/wifi issues, which is frustrating for online exams."
1927,1886460,1.0,5.0,"Definitely have to work for your grade. Although there is not a lot of homework, I found my self studying for hours and it never seemed to prepare me for the test. One of the hardest classes I have had to take."
1928,1886460,3.0,5.0,"Took him for Cell Bio. I did well in his class, but I can't say the same for the rest of my peers. There's TONS of info on each test, and some questions ask about nitty-gritty info that's easy to skip over or forget. Questions are worded weirdly. The note manual is simply his powerpoint slides printed out with margins. Don't buy the textbook."
1929,1886460,1.0,4.0,Horrible. Just absolutely horrible. Doesn't care about how his students are doing at all. Just really bad.
1930,1886460,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Kaplan is probably your best choice for Biology I. He does a great job at providing examples to better understand the material. If you took IB Biology in high school, this class should be a breeze. My only complaint is that we skipped a lot of content, in comparison to the other BIO I classes, so we may not be as prepared for Biology II."
1931,1886460,5.0,4.0,"Biology of Cancer is a hard class. He definitely makes you work for the grade. You really have to have an understanding of the material. I like Evan though and I took him for cell biology in the past, so I knew how his teaching style was. I looked forward to going to class every day to learn about cancer because he made it interesting."
1932,1886460,1.0,4.0,There were only 3 tests and three quizzes throughout the entire semester. Multiple students asked for help and extra credit due to having trouble learning with online classes. He blatantly disregarded student concerns and refused to help students in a time of need. Even tried to tell them to study in groups during a pandemic. No empathy. Very rude.
1933,1886460,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Kaplan is great at lecturing, but the tests are the hardest thing I've done in my five years of college. I spent hours studying the lectures, the note manual, and the notes I made based on the lectures. Yes, this was during COVID. I don't feel like he took that struggle into consideration when only giving 6 grades."
1934,1886460,4.0,4.0,"Only a couple test grades. No homework, and he makes it very clear that he offers no extra credit. Definitely not an easy A; however, I did enjoy his lectures and he gives good examples. Just put in the work and you should be fine. Also, don't expect to be let out of class early."
1935,1886460,5.0,4.0,He makes the class really chill which is a good thing for people who are stressed.
1936,1886460,5.0,3.0,"Great professor and I would definitely recommend taking him for Bio I. Only grades were tests, but there were extra credit questions on every test and a final that replaces lowest grade. He lays out his expectations for every exam &amp; they are multiple choice. His note manual was very helpful, but I never used the textbook."
1937,1886460,3.0,3.0,"Evan honestly is not a bad teacher but he is a big change from high school teachers. He does explain things multiple times and gives many examples, but I find it helpful to help me remember things. He gives NO extra credit or bonus except for a syllabus quiz which is still tricky. Book isn't needed but note manual is very helpful."
1938,1886460,2.0,5.0,He is so unorganized and does not teach. SI is helpful though. Would not take again.
1939,1886460,5.0,3.0,Love Kaplan!! Took him for Bio 1 and came out with a high A (barely went to class though). I took a different teacher for Bio 2 and made an average B. He explains everything so well and multiple times!
1940,1886460,4.0,4.0,"I took this class during summer 2020 and it was online b/c COVID, so keep that in mind. I had Dr. Kaplan for BIO 1 so I was familiar with his teaching/testing style. I definitely had to study A LOT outside of just watching lecture videos because his tests are very application based. Also, DONT buy the textbook, however I did buy his note manual."
1941,1886460,1.0,4.0,"His lectures are dry, and he explains the topics over and over. His test questions are VERY confusing. His last two tests were obviously online, and the questions were impossible to answer in the time limit. We did not even have notes for most of the test 4 questions. He does not know how to relay the topics in a way for undergrads to understand."
1942,1886460,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Evan Kaplan is an amazing Biology teacher. I took a different biology teacher the semester before and had to drop because she made it impossible for no reason! Mr. Kaplan has a nice note book with all his notes in it which is very beneficial. Also, he does not make his test harder than they have to be but very straight forward. TAKE MR KAPLAN!!"
1943,1886460,4.0,4.0,"Kaplan is really passionate about Biology, and he shows it in his teachings. His lectures can be boring at times, but he jokes around and makes them worth going to. Only grades on 4 tests, and really quizzes on fine detail. Having a biology background, I would study for hours on his exams. I made 1 A, 2 Bs, and a C, and thanks to EC I had a A."
1944,1886460,2.0,4.0,Kaplan's lectures are very boring and usually spent on one long-winded topic. He bases his lectures and exams on the note manual he publishes and spends the first two weeks of class pressuring you to buy one. He makes easy concepts confusing and the test questions are so confusing you can barely read them.
1945,1886460,5.0,2.0,by far my favorite teacher at MSU. I had him for bio 1 and cell bio and I would take him again in a heart beat. Test are straight forward and from the notes.
1946,1886460,5.0,3.0,"This class is really cool. Aside from 4 tests, you will have to write cancer reports. It seemed like he just graded them based on whether you did it or not. His tests are made from his slides but you want to get an A in this class I would use the book. Overall great professor"
1947,1886460,2.0,2.0,"Kaplan is one of the easier bio 1 professors. He tends to get sidetracked during lectures so we don't cover a lot of material. We had four exams plus the graded from the lab. On the exams, he offered five extra credit questions as well as the opportunity for an extra credit report."
1948,1886460,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Kaplan is great! He breaks up the less interesting parts of lecture with jokes, and his tests are straight from the notes - no surprises. I recommend going to SI for at least the test reviews to make sure you know your stuff. He's great at explaining concepts and giving understandable examples. Great professor to take for Bio 1."
1949,1886460,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Kaplan is a good choice for cell bio, but since grades are only determined by 4 exams, it's important to study hard for all of them. He no longer has a final, but he offers a 12 point extra credit report at the end of the semester. He'll make you think you need the textbook to make an A, but studying the note manual is sufficient for his exams."
1950,1886460,4.0,3.0,"Kaplans class can get a bit boring if you have learned the information before. However, you can buy a book with the slides and the test are DIRECTLY from the slides. I will get an A in the class and all I had to go was study my notes. He doesnt stick to schedule and you will not cover everything, but what you do cover is taught efficiently."
1951,1886460,4.0,4.0,I enjoyed Kaplans class. He isnt boring and his tests are fair. Just STUDY and do the extra credit.
1952,1886460,4.0,4.0,"Kaplan is really funny and obviously really smart. His lectures are just very boring and hard to follow. Also, the only grades given are the 4 tests we have, so if you flunk one, there's almost no way to come out with an A."
1953,1886460,2.0,4.0,"He doesn't teach. Is SOOOOO unorganized. He doesn't really help you that much when you go to his office hours. You will not stay on track with the syllabus, so don't even bother. His notes are boring and he just jumbles everything together and goes on rants."
1954,1886460,5.0,4.0,Kaplan is the only one who teaches this class. It's not an easy class and requires you to study his note manual pre-made for the class. He's a funny dude and likes to talk until 5 minutes left in the class. If you see him in officer hours he'll definitely explain things more in depth if you are struggling.
1955,1886460,4.0,4.0,"The tests make it super easy to get a B on them, however, due to the tricky nature of &quot;more than one of the above&quot; and &quot;all of the above,&quot; it makes quite the challenge to get that A. His lectures are funny, although I don't really gain anything from them, he seems to overexplain every single topic."
1956,1886460,5.0,4.0,"Kaplan is an amazing professor. His lectures can get a little heavy but he usually breaks them up with a joke of some sort. The class is only graded by 4 tests which focus more on processes than on vocabulary, so keep that in mind. There is a book you can buy with all of his slides in it with room for notes. The class isn't easy, but worth it."
1957,1886460,5.0,4.0,"hes a great prof, tough, but that means youre learning what you need to know and getting the most out of your tuition."
1958,1886460,5.0,4.0,"He just reads and explains the slides in the manuel during class. He is funny and his lectures are somewhat entertaining. Attendance isn't mandatory, and studying on your own instead of going to class will suffice. Tests are difficult and somewhat tricky. All of the test comes directly from the slides. No quizzes."
1959,1886460,5.0,3.0,"Hes a nice guy, funny, and his tests arent very hard at all. Basically a review of AP Biology from high school"
1960,1886460,5.0,2.0,"Think about what it would be like if your dad started teaching. Thats who Kaplan is. His tests are mostly off of the slides, so study them or you probably wont get an A. He makes a bunch of dad jokes in class and he wants students to succeed. Bio I can get boring easily but Kaplan is for sure your best option!"
1961,1886460,3.0,3.0,Not a bad teacher. Must study to get a good grade.
1962,1886460,4.0,2.0,"As long as you read that magic note manual, the tests are straightforward. He's very nice and enjoys talking. The lectures can get dull and long-winded; sometimes we'd only cover four slides in an hour."
1963,1886460,4.0,2.0,"Evan's class is an easy A if you study the note manual, which is every slide from the lecture. He's really funny which makes the class a lot less boring and is willing to explain things more in depth during his office hours."
1964,1886460,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Kaplan is great. For the most part, he makes the class interesting, but some things are pretty boring. I did not buy the textbook but you will need the note manual. Go SI if you have time, the leaders are great. The only bad thing is the four tests and lab grade are the only grades you get so do good on those."
1965,1886460,5.0,3.0,I LOVED Evan! I barely went to class and just studied the notes. SI sessions seriously help! The tests are really easy as long as you study. Ended with an A. DO NOT GET THE TEXTBOOK!!!!
1966,1886460,4.0,2.0,"Kaplan's a solid professor and an easy A. Prepare for multiple dad jokes and long tangents about seemingly nothing. However, it's important that you sit in class and pay at least some attention, because he usually has his students cross out large sections of his notes that he won't be testing on. Save yourself the extra study time and go to class."
1967,1886460,4.0,3.0,"It is an all lecture class but the note manual has every slide he will cover! Great, easy class! Ther"
1968,1886460,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Kaplan is a very good professor, and its not difficult to make an A in his class. If youve taken AP Bio or an advanced bio class in high school, this should be a breeze. He doesnt require attendance but you want to go to class because he marks out a lot of info you wont need to know for the test. Study well and youll be fine."
1969,1886460,4.0,3.0,Great teacher. Really good lectures most of the time. You are going to have to study to do well. Maybe not if you are just trying to pass
1970,1886460,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Kaplan is a good professor, but his lectures can be very boring. Attendance is mandatory. If you skip, you'll miss valuable information that you can't get from studying the note-taking manual alone. He uses very good analogies to help biology make more sense, and he also tells you what you don't need to know that is in the manual. SI sessions."
1971,1886460,5.0,3.0,"He's a great teacher and gets into it. Sit up front and he'll talk to you. Tests are the only grades so you have to study. He gives you his powerpoints in a book, so bring them to take notes with. Overall, great teacher and I would take him again."
1972,1886460,4.0,3.0,You can buy his &quot;note manual&quot; and get a fairly easy A as long as you understood BIO 1. He tries to put some humor into his lectures and readily answers questions.
1973,1886460,4.0,3.0,"Evan is such a cool guy. His lectures are hilarious, but the tests can be a little overwhelming. Make sure you study and you'll do fine. Attendance is not mandatory. I went to like five classes total (four of those days were test days) and still came out with a B."
1974,1886460,4.0,2.0,"Not the most interesting class; it's very elementary, but tests come straight from notes. Book is not needed. SI review makes it easier. He doesn't count absences, and his lectures are mostly him reading off slides. It's easier if you go to class but possible to get an A without going to class if you study and read the notes. Lots of memorization."
1975,1886460,4.0,3.0,"Probably the most easy-going professor I've ever taken. His lectures do become hard to pay attention to and are riddled with dad-jokes, but he does love what he teaches. His Bioinst class is easy for an upper-level bio student, but may be harder for others. Test are long but not terrible. Great class to learn how to lab reports in."
1976,1886460,4.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Kaplan for Bio 1 and loved him! He allows you to go over the tests in his office once they're graded. There's always 5 questions at the end of his tests that are for extra credit. He says he doesn't care if you come to class or not, but he usually has to skip some material so if you don't go you won't know what to not study."
1977,1886460,4.0,2.0,Very funny and covers material in depth. If you took AP Bio in High School this class is a joke and super easy. Tests are multiple choice and have plenty of bonus points possible. Very entertaining and kept class fun. Does not require attendance but skips through the material so it's worth going so you don't study extra material. Enjoyed this class
1978,1886460,5.0,2.0,"I currently have over a 100 average in Dr. Kaplan's class. His tests come straight from his notes. I don't go the SI sessions nor use the textbook (don't buy it). Just show up to class, pay attention, makes some notecards, and it'll be a breeze. He goes over all the material, tells you what won't be on the test, and and is funny. Straightforward."
1979,1886460,1.0,4.0,He is a terrible teacher. So monotone and he will go to the very last second of class every single class. His tests are really hard even if you do study you probably won't pass :) I'm retaking his class and my major is Bio!
1980,1886460,5.0,3.0,"I enjoy biology, but I loved Dr. Kaplan's class. It is a lot of material, but he presents it in a manner that is organized and easy to grasp."
1981,1886460,2.0,4.0,"Tests are tricky, boring, no homework, a lot of material"
1982,1886460,4.0,3.0,"Highly recommend!! He tries his best to make bio 1 as interesting as possible. The questions on the test are pretty simple, either you know them or you don't. Go to class, study, and you should do well in his class."
1983,1886460,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher! highly recommend for Bio 1. He is funny and keeps things interesting. The tests can be tough but if you study the notes you will do fine. His notes are already completely filled out in a note manual, and attendance is not mandatory."
1984,1886460,4.5,1.0,"Kaplan's class was super easy. It is basically high school biology. I never went to class and never studied for a test and made A's on all of them except one. Final is optional, and notes are prewritten that you can buy from Barnes and Noble."
1985,1886460,4.0,2.0,"He is very good about explaining concepts thoroughly.  Going to class isn't necessary for the material but he frequently says in class that there are things in the notes that won't be on the test.  Anything on the notes is fair game, but the tests are too hard.  There are always five extra credit questions.  Final is optional."
1986,1886460,4.5,2.0,He's the must take professor for biology at MSU. He's very helpful if you don't understand a concept. He will also go over the test with you after to make sure you understand what you missed.
1987,1886460,4.5,2.0,"He is great! Always makes sure no one has any questions before moving on in the lecture notes. He is animated during lecture, so it isn't that boring. DO NOT BUY OR RENT THE TEXTBOOK. You can ace his tests if you take the time to answer the questions at the beginning of his lecture notes. Easy class! Easy A! "
1988,1886460,3.5,2.0,Really easy class. Don't buy the textbook. Everything needed for the test is in the notes.
1989,1886460,4.0,1.0,I only attended seven classes and I got an A. Just study the slide book and you'll be fine. The SI sessions the night before usually give away a couple of test questions. 
1990,1886460,3.0,3.0,"Kaplan could care less if you show up for class. For lectures, he just rambles about the general topic and clicks through slides. All slides are in the workbook you can buy. Tests are a bit tricky, but not terrible. "
1991,1886460,3.5,1.0,"Kaplan is hilarious. Biology is biology, so if you took it in high school you""ll be bored out of your mind with the subject,  and that's not his fault. It is an intro class and he moves slowly because not everyone had it in high school. His stories are great and he's really excited about teaching which is awesome. "
1992,1886460,4.0,2.0,Evan is the best. His class requires a lot of studying but his lectures are amazing and very helpful. I didn't use my textbook at all and I came out with a B. I know I could have made an A if I had put in more effort. 
1993,1886460,3.5,2.0,"Although his lectures can be quite boring at times depending on your interests, as long as you show up, listen, and study his notes, you'll do fine on the tests. He also offers at least five bonus questions at the end of each test to help. Also, the final exam is optional if you have an A. Overall, he's a pretty cool guy."
1994,1886460,4.0,3.0,moves fast
1995,1886460,4.0,2.0,"Class is pretty easy. He rambles on sometimes, but everything you need is ussually on the powerpoints. So studying for the class is pretty easy. I would suggest this professor."
1996,1886460,4.0,4.0,"Pretty easy, don't buy the book just get the lecture notes and follow along. All the notes are online but I recommend going to class because he explains things really well and clearly."
1997,1886460,3.0,1.0,There's no need to go to class. Read the powerpoints for the test.
1998,1943815,1.0,1.0,"He was not available at any point through calls or emails. He vanished for a month two weeks into the semester, and we were left without required reading to complete the work, which made everything late. He might be better in person, but he lacks communication skills for online teaching. I learned absolutely nothing in this class."
1999,1943815,5.0,4.0,Focus on helping you develop your personal literature review. Excellent.
2000,1943815,5.0,5.0,Amazing professor. Really pulls the information out of you.
2001,1861901,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Erik Larson was a great professor!!  I had him at Moravian College.  He's a great guy with a lot of enthusiasm, he's very helpful, and stays in touch with the class.  He gives you a clear outline of what he expects in the class.  I sometimes don't get his jokes that he says in class, but who can forget his killer moustache."
2002,1861901,5.0,2.0,Mr. Larson was an excellent instructor!  I would highly recommend him to anyone that needs to take Earth Science!
2003,2590991,5.0,3.0,"Joe was a great teacher and I loved his class! He gives great feedback on drawings and does a really good job at demonstrating and explaining different techniques. Expect to spend a lot of time working outside of class on your drawings, he can always tell if you dont!"
2004,1976612,5.0,1.0,"Very amazing woman! would highly recommend if you are taking linear algebra. She makes the lectures enjoyable. 10/10 Personality. Tells you what you need and what you dont need for tests. Overall, has a great vibe and makes class great as well."
2005,1976612,5.0,3.0,Professor Smith is a godsend and anyone who says otherwise has not suffered as I have.
2006,1976612,5.0,3.0,"One of the best calculus professors at state! I highly recommend taking cal 1 with her. She literally tells you some of the questions/concepts that will be on the test the class before. She answers her emails quickly, and she is very approachable. She color codes her notes, and also posts them after class.  "
2007,1976612,5.0,3.0,"I took her for Cal 1, I was terrified of this class, but she made it enjoyable and understandable. Some people think she is snarky, but I honestly didn't. Her test are straight from the notes, she tells you what is on them, and she gives gracious points!! She is a great teacher, take her !! She also responds to emails very quickly and cares."
2008,1976612,4.0,3.0,Solid choice for Cal 1 and is very giving on partial credit for tests. She teaches very well and effectively. Definitely will take for Cal 3.
2009,1976612,5.0,3.0,"I loved Ms Smith! She's a great teacher and super willing to answer questions! If you can do the homework, you'll be great for the tests, so do that homework!"
2010,1976612,1.0,4.0,Avoid at all costs. She is rude and gave us a huge amount of work for her honors class. Didnt explain Mathematica very well but expected us to learn ourselves. Tests were unreasonable and she was not helpful when going to her office.
2011,1976612,5.0,4.0,"Very good lecturer, made it very obvious what was expected of us and when. She made the material much easier to understand than I expected, and was fair in grading. I took the Honors section, so my experience may be different from others."
2012,1976612,5.0,3.0,"She was amazing at explaining the content and stating explicitly what we needed to know how to do for the test. Lectures and tests were easy, but the homework was quite hard sometimes. I definitely recommend a Mathway subscription!"
2013,1976612,3.0,3.0,"Mrs. Smith is alright. Her lectures can be pretty one-dimensional (either you get it right off the bat or you have no idea what's going on), but she isn't necessarily bad at teaching. The most obvious thing is that she's kind of rude. I wouldn't want to have a private conversation with her, ever. Just go to class / SI and you'll be fine."
2014,1976612,1.0,4.0,Rude and unwilling to offer much help at all.
2015,1976612,3.0,4.0,"Smith is a decent teacher, but doesn't always explain things super well in lectures, especially in the first few weeks of the course so be sure to brush up on your trig because she will assume you know it well. The tests aren't overly difficult in themselves, she can just be a picky grader at times. Overall an okay teacher."
2016,1976612,5.0,3.0,"She works very hard with her students. There were two occasions where I needed to extra time due to outside circumstances and she worked very hard with me to help me be able to make the deadlines. Take advantage of her office hours, she really does like her students and will be super willing to help you no matter what."
2017,1976612,5.0,3.0,"I had her for honors cal 1. She was very caring and funny. She's very good at explaining problems, and I would recommend her to anyone. You could ask her &quot;what's on the test&quot;, and she'll tell you the exact problems. She was always happy to answer questions."
2018,1976612,1.0,4.0,"She was a very unreasonable professor as far as grading goes: unclear grading criteria when it comes to tests. There were plenty of times where she marked off excessive points for unfair reasoning. Calculus is a difficult subject, and she offered no extra credit whatsoever. I do not recommend at all."
2019,1976612,5.0,4.0,"This is the second time I have had Mrs. Smith. Cal 1 and now Cal 3. One of my favorite teachers that I have had at MSU. Her class is never easy, but she is very fair with her tests. She also does a fantastic job explaining things during lecture. Always responds to emails very quickly if you ever have questions."
2020,1976612,5.0,3.0,"She sets high standards for the class, but I really enjoyed her. Literally most of her test questions were straight from the notes, which she explains very well. She stays on track but is very high energy! I didn't do well in cal in high school, but she made it so much better! Highly recommend."
2021,1976612,4.0,4.0,"I had Professor Smith for calculus 1. Really good teacher, explains everything as simply as possible. It is a relatively difficult class but she makes it as easy as she can. No extra credit though, decent amount of homework."
2022,1976612,2.0,5.0,"Professor Smith moves very quickly, so it can sometimes be hard to keep up especially if you have no background in trig. She is comes off rude and abrasive sometimes. Her teaching style and comments can be very degrading if you aren't experienced in calculus. None of the tests were multiple choice, and she refused to offer any extra credit."
2023,1976612,4.0,4.0,"Cal involves a lot of trig, and you need to know it (prof Smith will not refresh your trig knowledge).She isn't very approachable when it comes to questions and gets irritated with disruptions. She can come off a bit abrasive at times, but she cares. Given, the tests are a bit difficult (a mix of open response and multiple choice)."
2024,1976612,1.0,3.0,"Very short temper, and very disrespectful at times. She does not give a crap about you. do not take her class."
2025,1976612,5.0,5.0,Best math teacher ever!! Definitely would take her again if I could! So helpful and willing to meet with you and reteach a concept you didnt understand. Requires attendance but very lenient!
2026,1976612,4.0,3.0,"She had a lot of personality and made lectures entertaining. As someone that is very bad at math, she helped make the semester a lot less painful. She explains everything very in depth and works at a very easy to follow pace. Tests are a large portion of the grade, but they are not bad. Try to get in a section with SI as that was very helpful."
2027,1976612,5.0,3.0,Jaclyn is funny and has a lot of personality. Makes calculus less painful. Does well with explaining topics.
2028,1976612,4.0,3.0,Its a fast pace class so you may have a rough start especially if you didnt have much trig or precalculus. Shes sassy but I assure you she cares about you. Shes willing to help you in her office hours.
2029,1976612,5.0,3.0,"She made calculus so fun! She is so funny and sarcastic. She color codes her notes so its super easy to follow, and she pretty much tells you exactly whats going to be on the tests. If you pay attention in class and do your homework, youll pass."
2030,1976612,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Smith was a fairly decent teacher, but I wish I had taken her for Cal I and not Honors Cal I. The concepts taught were different, but she was easily accessible outside of class and never kept us bell to bell. Lots of homework though, and the tests were very difficult. However, if you keep absences to a minimum, your final replaces lowest test."
2031,1976612,1.0,4.0,exams are fine. But as a person she is horrible. I hated her.
2032,1976612,5.0,3.0,"Jaclyn Smith was an amazing Cal I teacher. If you go to class and do the homework, you will do good in her class. There are absolutely no surprises on the tests; they are all fair and accurately represent the material she goes over in class. Fast paced lectures so don't skip. She also grades and gives back test scores extremely quick."
2033,1976612,5.0,3.0,"She is my favorite professor at MSU. She knows her stuff and has an excellent teaching style. You know exactly what to expect on the tests and study guides cover everything you'll need to know. Notes are posted online, but go to class because her lectures are funny, and she interacts with students and is always willing to help. 10/10 professor"
2034,1976612,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Smith just has a good vibe about her that I cant really put into words. Calculus isnt an easy class, but she at least made sure it wasnt horribly boring. She brings her personality to the classroom in the best way."
2035,1976612,5.0,4.0,"Mrs. Smith is AMAZING! She lays everything out plain as day, and if you dont get it you can ask questions. She uses colors to help show how things work, which is wonderful. I recommend especially if one has ADHD/ADD because of her teaching style."
2036,1976612,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic Cal I professor! I was very new to Calculus coming into the class and was afraid I would get left behind, but Ms. Smith did a fantastic job of breaking down the basics. She made it very clear that she cared about our grade and does a fantasic job of reviewing for tests. Absolutely no surprises on exams and even includes humor in lectures!"
2037,1976612,4.0,4.0,"Smith was an excellent Cal I teacher! She was always upbeat and really cool during class which was great because it was pretty early in the morning. Since this was not my first Cal rodeo I maybe biased, but she taught me the basics of Cal faster and better than my high school teacher. Do go with Smith if you have the chance!"
2038,1976612,3.0,4.0,"For me, it was hard to listen to her tach and write down everything she was writing (working problems). She posts her worked problems in class until people stop showing up. Test have some multiple choice and show your work. Worked easy questions in class, harder ones given as study questions. If you dont go to class your final won' replace a test."
2039,1976612,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Smith is AMAZING! Take her for any class you can. She is very funny and relaxed. She gives you shortcuts to save time working problems, and she gives study guides for the tests. Tests were only 10 questions for cal 1. She makes calculus much less daunting and seemingly easy even though it is known for being hard. 100% take her!!"
2040,1976612,2.0,4.0,Do not take this course in the summer if you are weak in math. Ms. Smith is not normally a professor for algebra so it was evident that she was not use to dealing with students who had limited ability in the subject. This test was very hard and the only way I passed was with a tutor. Use the learning center to your advantage and do not buy the book
2041,1976612,4.0,3.0,"Jaclyn is a great teacher, but moves through quickly. I was not familiar with trig, so I struggled on that part of cal 1, but she posts all her notes online color coated, I still recommend taking notes to help learn it. Her study guides for the exam are helpful, but the tests are harder than the review for sure, just pay attention to do good."
2042,1976612,4.0,4.0,"The transition from HS cal 1 to college cal 2 wasn't bad with her. She's sarcastic and can sometimes come across as rude, but overall tells you what you need to know. She uploads color coated notes online which is very helpful, and homework isn't too bad. You do have to buy a course code. Three 13 question tests &amp; 25 question final. quick grader"
2043,1976612,3.0,2.0,"As others have stated, she does post the notes after class, but her teaching style can be confusing, and she sometimes gives off a very flippant vibe. The class is not difficult, just confusing at times. But she does tell you pretty much exactly what you need to know for tests."
2044,1976612,4.0,3.0,"Goes through material during class and posts notes online after class. The best thing about this class is review day you work problems almost identical to the test. So if you can do the problems on the review, you should have no problem on any of the tests."
2045,1976612,5.0,1.0,"Smith is great. The class was fairly straightforward and gives great test reviews and study guides. As long as you show up and follow the notes, you'll be fine. Study guide and homework questions are exactly like the test. I never studied, the class period before the test was dedicated to reviewing and that's all I needed."
2046,1976612,3.0,4.0,She'll take the time to answer questions you have. She goes through the questions pretty quickly and it's hard to keep up if you keep lagging behind.
2047,1976612,3.0,3.0,"The notes taken in class will be posted online and theyre color coded, so theyre pretty easy to follow. She is really laid back and sarcastic. Some days she seemed like she didnt even want to be there. She moves quickly, so pay attention."
2048,1976612,4.0,2.0,"Would highly recommend you to have a background of Calculus 1 if taking in the summer. Ms. Smith is a good teacher, however summer is condensed so more of what she does is reviewing material not really teaching it. Going to review days is really important, as the review is basically the test, with different wording and numbers."
2049,1976612,2.0,4.0,She's not a really good teacher. She teaches at you and often speaks too much while trying to explain which causes things to be confusing. She tricks you on each test a lot.
2050,1976612,5.0,3.0,"Her notes were super thorough, and she posted them online and they were color coded. She posts the blank notes too, which I always printed out before class. She tells you exactly what to expect on tests and she gets your grades back to you quickly. As long as you can do the study guide and the in class problems, you'll be fine on tests"
2051,1976612,3.0,4.0,"She was okay, just your average teacher. Didnt go above and beyond. She seemed kind of annoyed some days when coming in to teach."
2052,1976612,4.0,4.0,I've heard great things about all the calculus teachers and I honestly believe you can't go wrong. Study very hard for the test because they are a large portion of your grade. I'm a math person but calculus is very hard so I would recommend future students to have a strong foundation of college algebra and trig before taking calculus.
2053,1976612,4.0,3.0,"Smith was a good Calculus teacher. She posted color coded notes online, &amp; had very thorough reviews before all tests. She was very good at hinting what to expect on the tests. She was sarcastic but in a funny way. 7 multiple choice (4pts. a piece) and 6 show your work questions (12pts. a piece) were the tests. 13 homework assignments. Had to study."
2054,1976612,2.0,4.0,"Jaclyn seems like during class she doesn't really care if we pass the class or not. She flies through the sections like its nothing and kind of has this know it all attitude like she's the best. She definitely knows what shes talking about, but teaches it in the most difficult way possible. Unless you're superb at Cal 1, I would avoid."
2055,1976612,3.0,3.0,She was an ok calculus teacher. Nothing social. It she wasn't bad either. She is a really tough grader.
2056,1976612,4.0,4.0,"She's is a great teacher, if your a good student and come to class and pay attention. She super sarcastic, it's rather hilarious. Don't confuse the fact that she's laid back with her not caring. She does. Tough but fair."
2057,1976612,2.0,5.0,Took her in Spring 2017. She was not very good. It felt like she was just going through the motions and didn't really care if we were catching on or not.
2058,1976612,5.0,2.0,Had Mrs. Smith for Cal 1 and it was very very easy. I took AP CAL in high school but even then Mrs. Smith gives a great non mandatory review the class before her tests. She definitely wants her students to ace every test and the final. Definitely take Smith for Cal 1 no questions asked
2059,1976612,5.0,4.0,"I don't know what other people are talking about; I thought Mrs. Smith was great for Calc 1. Yes,  the class is test heavy, but she gives you reviews before each test. She helped me outside of class and in office hours. The final exam wasn't fun though. I really hate night exams, but that's departmental exams."
2060,1976612,2.0,3.0,She was alright. I got through but wish I had a more enthusiastic teacher.
2061,1976612,5.0,4.0,Very strong lecture and great at conveying material. She is very good about responding to emails and answering questions fully.
2062,1976612,2.0,3.0,She was just the usual math teacher. Nothing special but nothing bad. The one nice thing she would do is spoon feed us the test questions from her review. So don't miss review days.
2063,1976612,4.0,2.0,Tests are very heavy on the grading scale.  She gives you a lot of answers on the test so pay attention and go to the test sessions.  The class is pretty easy but takes some studying.  She has a good sense of humor and class is interesting. overall she is solid and a good choice
2064,1976612,5.0,2.0,"One of the best math teachers I've ever had.  It's been years since I've had a math class, and the way she runs the class, in particular her color coded notes (which are super easy to follow, even if you happen to miss class) and review sessions for tests made this class a breeze.   I finished with a strong A, and I wish she teaches Cal II!"
2065,1976612,2.0,3.0,A very dull teacher. She treats her students like they are 2. She was overall a decent teacher but I think tries to hard to try and make her students like her.
2066,1976612,5.0,2.0,"Jaclyn Smith is really funny in a quirky way.  I didn't take Cal in high school and came out with an A.  Her teaching method is to the point and not confusing, and her tests can be studied as she gives out study guide.  Finals are basically the study guide with some mixed up numbers."
2067,1976612,4.0,2.0,"If you took Cal 1 in high school, this class is a breeze.  Minimal studying, finished with a high A.  Great teacher, knows what she's talking about."
2068,1976612,3.5,4.0,"Smith is a great teacher. Although her class is tough, she teaches the material in an effective manner. She is also available outside of class for extra help. I would highly recommend her for cal 1, however just make sure you are willing to put the work into her class. "
2069,1976612,5.0,2.0,She is amazing and very helpful!
2070,1976612,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Smith is very down to earth, and very enthusiastic about student success and her job. She is extremely clear in her lecture style, and is funny!!! I would recommend her to everyone for trigonometry and Calculus 1. I wished she taught calculus 2.. "
2071,1976612,5.0,2.0,Absolutely the best professor I've had. Super helpful. Prepared us for every exam. Lets you out early on Fridays. Really enjoyed her lectures. 
2072,2345277,5.0,3.0,Great professor. There are a couple of group projects. Decent amount of homework but not difficult. Great professor to just have conversations with about school or personal. Greatly recommend.
2073,2181444,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Olivieri was a great teacher for technical writing. Would break down the assignments to make them less complex and work around our other classes. There's only like 3 major assignments in this class, so we were never overwhelmed with work. If you follow directions and give an honest effort, you should have no problem in this class."
2074,2181444,1.0,1.0,"If you take her class you'll end up with an A, but you won't actually learn anything. Her lectures are absolutely useless as they have no relation to the test, but she'll basically give you the test as a study guide. It's an absolute joke of a class, but if you want an A I'd take it."
2075,2181444,4.0,1.0,Lectures are kind of long and boring but she reads the test to you the day before. Easy A!
2076,2181444,5.0,1.0,TAKE HER. You show up and pass. literally. You don't HAVE to understand ANYTHING. The class before test day she reads THE TEST straight out to the class. Her lectures are HILARIOUS she's SO funny. I hope to take her again.
2077,2181444,5.0,1.0,"Professor Olivieri was awesome. There is no excuse for not receiving an A in this class. She covers all the material in class, and she even READS the test to you, in class, before you take it. Like I said, no reason not to make an A. A few of the answers come from the book, so get it. But it's not expensive! All in all, this class SHOULD BE easy."
2078,2582853,1.0,5.0,Absolutely horrible. Never in my life have I had such a horrible experience. Overall would not take chemistry at MSU period unless taking it with either Nettles professor!
2079,2582853,1.0,5.0,"Misses a lot of practice problems. Mumbles a lot during lectures. The chemistry department as a whole here is not good. Mr. Wipf is a smart guy, but hes very hard to understand and follow along with in lectures. The class averages for our tests would be all you need to know."
2080,2582853,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Wipf was the worst professor I've ever had. He would never get the example problems right in class. Students were always having to correct him. He could never really answer a students question. It was like he was learning the material for the first time too. Do not take if you can, but the chem department as a whole is just as awful as Dr. Wipf"
2081,2582853,4.0,4.0,I think he was a great chemistry teacher. He was very accessible outside of class and was quick to respond to my emails.
2082,551251,3.5,4.0,Chemistry is not my subject but I managed to make an A in this class. Coming to lectures is important and so is studying. He was good at answering questions and the help sessions were great. I would recommend getting the book for studying purposes.
2083,551251,1.0,5.0,He was useless!!
2084,551251,2.5,4.0,does not teach in class at all. everything is online
2085,551251,2.0,4.0,"Helps to go to class ans pay attention, but to make that easier it helps to not take the class at 8am. I hate Chemistry but understood it pretty well in his class. Homework was hard, but helped for the test."
2086,551251,4.0,2.0,"He is a very nice teacher. I did not think the tests were that hard. The online homework is pretty tough, however, it is possible. Very nice guy. His jokes are pretty funny, too!!"
2087,551251,1.5,5.0,Tests are a lot harder than the material that he teaches during class.  There is tons of online homework which takes up a lot of your time.
2088,551251,1.0,5.0,not very good
2089,551251,4.0,5.0,"Very interested in his class, but the OWL homework is insane. The homework takes up the majority of my time. He holds a out-of-class study session the day before a test. I still cant believe the amount of homework he puts up on OWL though."
2090,551251,1.0,5.0,"His tests are a lot harder than what he makes them out to be. OWL takes FOREVER and then some! He seems to have an axe to grind to prove he is better than every one else! Don't listen to him, go read your book what ever he says will probably not be on the test, Just read the book, do math!"
2091,551251,3.5,3.0,"The online homework is tedious, his tests are a lot harder than his lectures prepare you for.  Tests are multiple choice, but are more math problems than theory or definitions."
2092,2484567,1.0,3.0,"To start off, I took her my freshman year and had to withdraw from her class because of how hard it was due to the fact that she only read off of her powerpoint slides and never explained anything whatsoever. You honestly could just not go to class and probably would do better on the tests teaching yourself the material because she is terrible."
2093,2484567,4.0,2.0,"Overall good experience. I took the class online, but it was still fun. There are quizzes about every other week and then a weekly lab. All pretty easy."
2094,2484567,5.0,1.0,probably the EASIEST class I've ever taken. I took plants &amp; humans for a bio requirement and I took it fully online. All of the tests and quizzes were open-book so it was literally just take notes and pass the class. she was also very straightforward and I didn't have to send a single email - easy easy A.
2095,2484567,3.0,4.0,"I had Mrs. Harrison her 1st semester as a college professor. Honestly, in the beginning, I was NOT her biggest fan. BUT, she got much better towards the end. Her class is tough &amp; some things would be on the test that wasn't in her notes, but for the most part the tests are fair. Study &amp; take the optional final to replace your lowest exam, it helps!"
2096,2484567,5.0,3.0,"I dont know why she is rated so low here. Its obvious that Professor Harrison is excited when she teaches about plants, often going off on tangents about a few interesting ones. The material itself isnt that great, but she makes it interesting. You have to study to do well on the tests, but she wants her students to do well."
2097,2484567,3.0,1.0,"if you are willing to teach yourself, you will do amazing. just know that she will only read off the slides in class, so you will not learn anything she doesn't post."
2098,2484567,1.0,1.0,"She's super boring but not difficult. The only grades are the four tests and optional final; there is no homework. Just show up, it's not a hard class to sit through. All you need is the notes she puts online to study for the tests."
2099,2484567,1.0,2.0,"Ms. Harrison does not teach. Ms. Harrison reads. From the slides, that is. During class, she pulls up a powerpoint and reads from it in the most monotone voice possible. She posts the slides online, too, and since participation isn't mandatory, there is NO reason to come to class. Just study the slides, go to SI, and show up for the tests."
2100,2484567,3.0,3.0,"Not very engaging, basically just reads the slides, but not terrible by any means. Class is easy as long as you study, the tests are just on the notes."
2101,2484567,4.0,3.0,"She is monotone and boring, but her tests are straight from the notes."
2102,2484567,1.0,5.0,"She is the worst teacher I have ever had. I was a straight A student in high school and took several honors classes and I almost failed this course. All she does is talk in a monotoned voice and read directly off of the slide. She is so boring and the tests are impossible. If you can avoid this woman, DO IT."
2103,2484567,1.0,4.0,"If you want a professor that just reads slides, then shes your professor! Absolutely no extra credit, and all that you are graded on are the tests. I would never take her again. Some may think she was easy, but theyre the ones that took AP Bio and already know most of it."
2104,2484567,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher I have ever had. I took honors biology in Junior of highschool and received an A+, and I failed her biology class. She does not teach, she reads. She does not offer any extra credit and the only 4 grades you have are tests."
2105,2484567,1.0,5.0,"Boring, does not teach anything in class that is not on the powerpoint, no point in going to class, went to office hours to ask questions and she told me too google them. Test are very hard."
2106,2484567,1.0,5.0,"The worst teacher I have ever had. Has no personality whatsoever. Believes she enjoyment in crushing pre med dreams. Reads slide in monotone voice in hopes the students fall asleep in class. Test are just ridiculous, Albert Einstein would be happy if he got a B in this class. Also very rude in her emails and not access able for office hours."
2107,2484567,1.0,5.0,Not recommended at all.
2108,2484567,1.0,4.0,"Lindsay Harrison is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. She reads directly from the PowerPoints during her lectures, and she clearly has no passion for teaching. Notes are posted online so I basically taught the whole class to myself. Attendance is not mandatory, and I believe it's because she truly doesn't care about her students' success"
2109,2484567,2.0,4.0,"She doesn't really deviate from the slides (which are posted online), but she goes at a slow pace and answers questions. The tests are pretty difficult (75 multiple choice &amp; matching w/ 5 bonus questions). Tests are usually curved b/c of the low class average, but if you go to SI and study a lot, you should be fine. Office hours help a lot too!"
2110,2484567,2.0,4.0,"She reads her notes directly off the slide and does not go into depth about the material. When her tests come around, she expects you to know the in-depth material. There is no extra credit, but she drops your lowest exam grade. If you go to her office hours, she will try to help you with the material. I would not recommend her for BIO I."
2111,2484567,1.0,4.0,"She was a horrible teacher and going to class was worthless because she didn't teach anything. I can read off a powerpoint myself, I needed her to explain the material which she didn't do. She may be new to this, but I am not paying for an education for someone to read to me. Ridiculous."
2112,2484567,1.0,4.0,"She taught this class horribly. I attended every lecture and all she did was read word for word from a powerpoint, then sat in silence for everyone to copy it down. No explanation of the material. The ONLY reason I got an A in this class is because I taught myself. I am a straight A student and she is easily the worst teacher I have ever had."
2113,2484567,3.0,3.0,"For General Microbiology. Have to go to class to fill in the blanks for powerpoints uploaded. She mainly reads from the slides, but will occasionally tell you things you need to know for sure for the test. I believe this is the first time she taught a class so cutting her some slack here. She can be a bit sassy but she got thrown into this."
2114,551259,4.5,2.0,She's extremely rude and also very close-minded. She asks your opinion but then interrupts before you say anything. She's a selfish person who wants you to see things her way.Her attitude is the worst. I've seen her publicly humiliate students in class . She is also prejudiced towards some religions and will make it known if the subject comes up wh
2115,551259,4.0,2.0,"I think she really wants to help the class do well and is enthusiastic about her subject. I think her attendance policy is punitive for those who may get ill during the semester, however. I got the stomach flu and ended up missing a week of class. After 2 missed classes, she takes 5 points off for each class you miss off of your grade total."
2116,551259,2.0,4.0,She is not someone that should be teaching speech. She is a bad example of what a speech is about. She needs to consider not smoking!
2117,551259,4.5,2.0,She's really helpful and doesn't grade your speeches very hard.  Her tests are hard though.  If you talk in class and show up she likes you.
2118,551259,5.0,2.0,"If you show up to class and participate in conversations, then she will notice you are trying. She tells you what to study for the tests, which are no big deal. Puts more emphasis on speeches than tests. DO NOT READ YOUR SPEECHES-she hates that. Nerves are the only thing you have to battle for speeches-she grades pretty easy."
2119,551259,4.5,2.0,"She is pretty good about allowing the discussions to flow among the students in class. The tests are not tough, except for the occasional tricky question. She likes to get fun conversations started in class as well."
2120,551259,4.0,2.0,"she is an easy teacher, does not rate your speeches harshly....come to class and she will help you out a lot"
2121,551259,4.5,2.0,No Comments
2122,551259,1.5,1.0,"She's arrogant and standoffish.  She grades the speeches too harsh.  The test scores in her class are low.  Multiple choice tests, mostly common knowledge."
2123,551263,3.0,5.0,"I didn't take Cal in high school, so I struggle in this class. She goes very fast and doesn't really explain, but she's getting better at that. If you haven't taken cal, don't take her. I've spent lots of time lost and having to learn on my own. Nice person and funny though, she made the 8 AM bearable."
2124,551263,4.0,2.0,"I found the class to be very easy, but I, like most of the other students, had taken calculus in high school. She loves when people ask questions in class so feel free to do that. I overall enjoyed the class and am glad I took it. It was an easy A."
2125,551263,4.0,3.0,"I had her as an honors course. She went quickly and typically finished the material early. She would do plenty of examples but often would not explain what or why she would do certain things. All homework was posted at the beginning of the year, and the assignments are short but very frequent (2-3 per week) with very helpful video tutorials."
2126,551263,4.0,2.0,Teaches material at a slow pace and is willing to answer any questions. Takes a no-nonsense approach and works plenty of examples. Gives heads-up about tough homework problems and works through a review sheet before each test.
2127,551263,4.0,2.0,My second time taking the course and compared to my 1st professor she was great. Very helpful and moved at a reasonable pace. Was always available outside of class and she always would tell us exactly what was on the test.
2128,551263,2.0,3.0,"Had her for Honors Cal 1. Thank goodness I took AP Cal in high school because Dr. Miller flies through the material without really explaining. In class she does example after example, but then usually lets us out early. Her tests are just like the study guide!"
2129,551263,3.0,5.0,"Only taught for 1 hour, then left.  Class periods are 2 hours.  Homework was ridiculously easy in cotrast with very difficult tests and a supremely difficult final with problems more complex than we had ever worked in her class."
2130,551263,5.0,2.0,She offered great help outside of class and the tests were very clear.  She also went over any questions we had on homework which was extremely helpful!
2131,551263,5.0,1.0,Very good teacher..makes everything interesting and easier to understand. Test are very straightforward.
2132,551263,5.0,3.0,Best prof in the department as far as I'm concerned. Tells you EXACTLY what will be on every test. Doesn't take up homework but test problems are very similar to assigned homework. Very pleasant person and easy to talk to. I liked her a lot.
2133,551263,5.0,5.0,"Difficult class, but excellent teacher.  Interesting."
2134,2713968,3.0,2.0,Dr. Borgen is super nice and really cares about his students. Overall his class was pretty easy and if I had questions I always felt comfortable asking him for help.
2135,461177,2.0,4.0,"Many may argue, but I personally feel her teaching skills need a bit work. Its not completely awful though."
2136,461177,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. King was a great math teacher. Gives weekly homework and quizzes. 4 tests that she gives study guides for. Attendance isnt huge, but she gives major bonus points at the end of semester if you have been coming to class."
2137,461177,4.0,4.0,"Professor King is a good teacher. However, she goes really fast so if you don't understand much Calculus, don't expect her to slow down. However, she works around 3 or 4 of the same problems so you can understand. There are tons of homework and quizzes. Definitely study for her tests. Overall, I'd take her again but if you hate math, don't take her"
2138,461177,1.0,5.0,worst math class ever. did not understand anything. no partial credit. does not explain the math concepts instead just gives you answers to examples.
2139,461177,2.0,4.0,Does not explain problems well. Very fast pace and get aggrivated if you hold up to much class time. I do not recommend her if you are not a very good math student. She expects you to kinda know things in her class without her having to explain in details. Horrible Teacher!!
2140,461177,4.5,3.0,"She works through all of the problems, and she makes things easy to understand. The tests can be difficult but there are old tests in the book to study with."
2141,461177,1.5,5.0,Nice lady but teaches too fast if you are not great in math stay away from her!
2142,461177,4.0,1.0,Easy if you show up for class. Does give a drop grade if you miss no more than 3 days.
2143,461177,3.5,4.0,"tests are difficult, requires many, many formulas, doesn't cut any slack, but she does offer a drop grade"
2144,461177,4.5,3.0,"she takes an extra effort to help you, attendance isn't mandatory but if you miss no more than 3 days, you get a drop grade for a test"
2145,461177,5.0,2.0,nice and easy
2146,1149330,5.0,3.0,"Has a passion for his subject. Made us laugh a lot. Great professor, made everything clear. If you pay attention you will do fine."
2147,1149330,4.0,3.0,"He's a great teacher that cares about his students. He'll make sure you learn (whether you want to or not) but he's not out to get you. He wants you to learn and understand and while he does teach mostly in Spanish (get used to it, especially if you're continuing in FLS), he will explain in English if he has to."
2148,1149330,3.0,3.0,"If you do not have a passion for French do not take his class. Also sometimes he can be rude when he answers questions because he answers them in such a way that he makes you feel like you are stupid. Also he is a very tough grader when it comes to participation, don't think you can just show up for class and get those points. "
2149,1149330,1.5,4.0,Was a professor that didn't know how to dummy the language down in practical ways for beginners. I would not suggest you take his class if it isn't your passion. He is a great guy none the less. And does know his stuff! Good Luck and be ready to work if you choose this route!
2150,1149330,2.0,2.0,"He's a pretty good teacher but he's also difficult. If you're not majoring in Spanish or passionate about the language DO NOT take his class. He's a little too serious for those of us who are just trying to fill the requirement and keep moving. Great guy..not so great teacher. I do a lot of ""self-teaching"". The worst part:he ONLY speaks in Spanish."
2151,2140569,5.0,3.0,Music of The Beatles- we reviewed almost the entire discography. Discussion prompts were meaningful to the content; quizzes and journaling assignments were easy if you read and listened to the assigned material. A short paper was due at the end of class but Dr. Sobaskie was helpful and responded quickly by email when help was needed. 
2152,2140569,4.0,3.0,Dr. Sobaskie is a wealth of knowledge. He was very respectful of the class and wanted to make sure that we succeeded. I would take from him again.
2153,2140569,5.0,3.0,Really nice guy. Very accessible for help outside of class. He is extremely knowledgeable in music theory. A great resource and easy to talk to.
2154,2140569,1.5,5.0,"He is the only teacher for upper level theory and ear training, so good luck. His lectures somehow manage to explain none of the course material whatsoever despite managing to last for the entire class period five days a week. If you don't turn in the assignments, some of which make no sense, you will not pass."
2155,2427295,1.0,5.0,Where do I begin. This is the most difficult class Ive had at state to this point. The volume of homework and the level at which it is graded are both absurd. You will work harder in this ELECTIVE than you will in any of your senior core curriculum classes. She is extremely condescending. Save yourself the pain and take a different class.
2156,969132,5.0,1.0,"Her tests come straight from the powerpoints.  She's not very interesting, but that's easy to overlook when you realize just how easy the class is."
2157,969132,4.5,4.0,No Comments
2158,1943983,5.0,2.0,She is one of the best professors I have ever had since being at this institution! She really does care about your success. She is dedicated to ensuring that the material is learned by each student before giving the test to ensure the best result for everyone's benefit.
2159,1943983,4.5,3.0,She's there for you if you care. She wants all of her students to do well but recognizes she can't force someone to learn. If you are interested and pay attention she'll notice and help you understand. She tries to go over a topic until everyone gets it. Awesome teacher!!
2160,1943983,5.0,2.0,"She is an amazing professor, she is actually the best professor I have ever had at this university. She actually cares about each one of her student's success and wants to make sure that everyone understands the material and is there and will work with anyone does not understand. She said that she will even tutor during her office hours and breaks."
2161,2484658,5.0,2.0,"Does not require attendance. However there are participation activities and if you miss a participation activity its an automatic 0 so you do have to come to class. However, responds to emails very quickly and is very willing to help her students. Really easy A"
2162,2484658,2.0,4.0,"Tricky quizzes, reading reflections, and an insane PowerPoint final project addressing everything you learned over the semester. Would not take as an elective!"
2163,2484658,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Crabtree is very passionate about the subject. There are weekly quizzes that are difficult & confusing. There are weekly papers where you have to type a reflection about a reading. These readings can be 20 pages long. She grades these reflections really hard. The papers & quizzes are the only grades for the class. Also, lectures are confusing"
2164,2484658,3.0,3.0,Solid teacher. She was very passionate about what she taught and is very respectable to all in the classroom.
2165,2484658,4.0,2.0,Ms. Crabtrees intro to sociology class was pretty easy. There was a quiz at the end of each week which was open note and there were for learning assignments throughout the course which were easy as well. Pay attention to lectures and youll do fine on the quizzes. The final sub field paper was somewhat difficult but she isnt a strict grader.
2166,2484658,5.0,2.0,Professor Crabtree is an excellent professor who really cares about what she's teaching. She's very accessible outside of class. We didn't use the textbook much this year but it's there as an option and all the weekly quizzes were open note. It's easy to get an A if you do the assignments and turn them in on time.
2167,2484658,2.0,4.0,"Professor Crabtree has good intentions, but trying to get all the information for the test from her lectures and the book is difficult. The tests are hard to study for and difficult to take. I wouldn't recommend this class unless modern social problems are a passion of yours and you're willing to do a good amount of reading outside of class."
2168,2484658,3.0,3.0,Ms. Crabtree is a pretty solid choice. Her lectures were sometimes a little monotonous but she gives you all the information. She really values student feedback &amp; works with the class to create the optimal learning experience. Be prepared for some book reading &amp; surprise group work. Her assignments and tests are fair. Attendance affects your grade.
2169,2058715,5.0,1.0,Amazing Professor! Teaches you what you need to know and won't make you do unnecessary work. Explains things well and makes the class easy. He will reward you for good attendance and is a pretty funny guy
2170,2058715,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Olsen is a funny guy and a great teacher. He just wants you to get the basics down, so most problems are 2-D. He's good at explaining things and will help you if you get stuck. He likes to joke around during lecture and keeps class from being boring. He commutes from Alabama, so he can be hard to get a hold of on Fridays. Take him if you can!"
2171,2681320,2.0,3.0,"NO
"
2172,2009594,5.0,1.0,He is outstanding. He is one of the smartest professors I have ever had & cares about what he is teaching. Just attend all of the lectures or email him the reason why you cant attend. He is understanding and caring. I want to take another one of his classes. 
2173,2009594,1.0,4.0,"Rambles through lectures with PowerPoints that have way too much information not relevant to the subject at hand. I would not recommend taking this class. Good guy terrible professor, as I have learned next to nothing."
2174,2009594,5.0,2.0,Hes a really sweet and kind professor. He mostly cares about participation and attendance. He rambles but if you just focus on the study guide then youll be just fine. I took him for 2 classes and I got good grades.
2175,2009594,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Kallfelz is a very intelligent man, and you can tell just by his lectures, he just isnt a very good teacher. His powerpoints are just random bits of information that correlate loosely with the subject, and his lectures dont have much structure either. He gives study guides that have the exact information you need."
2176,2009594,1.0,2.0,"He rambles, is highly opinionated, and his PowerPoints are useless. On discussion days, he talks most of the time. You don't actually have to read all 63 or whatever articles, just a few for the papers. For the terms on exams, he wants a paragraph. He hates technology in class, and interrupts himself over it. He also misquotes things, so be warned."
2177,2009594,2.0,3.0,"I would not recommend him to anyone. His slides are just random excerpts from books and articles, and his lectures are just random ideas that pop into his head. Attendance is mandatory and he WILL call you out (rudely) for being on your computer/phone/whispering to your neighbor. There are two write-out tests and two 5-8 page papers."
2178,2009594,1.0,1.0,Dr. Kallfelz is one of the worst professors I've ever had. He can not handle people coming into class more than a minute past start time. If you do he will waste 10 minutes berating the student. He also doesn't allow any computers for notes. That being said its an easy class. Just show up to class and you will pass with a B. Don't recommend him.
2179,2009594,1.0,3.0,"Honestly, one of the worst professors I have ever taken. He rambles on through the whole class and gets off topic a lot. He does not allow ANY electronics in his room and literally will call you out if you're on them. My least favorite class i've ever taken. DO NOT TAKE HIM. you will regret it :) and he can be very rude :)"
2180,2009594,3.0,4.0,"He doesnt like people to use phones or laptops. He will call you out for it. He is a good teacher and knows the material but I just didnt enjoy the class. There are two papers that are each about 5-7 pages long. Also, there are only two tests. They are both completely written. This includes essay questions and definitions."
2181,2009594,2.0,2.0,"Easy A but you'll hate every second of it. He rambles for the entirety of class. It sounds like he's talking in his sleep. Seemingly terrified of technology - he will call you out for using any, even for notes! No talking in class, either - he will stop class and call you out. Gives study guides with test questions a week before the test."
2182,2009594,1.0,2.0,"He tells the class about his personal problems. He's often late to class. He complains about technology use in class but previously said technology was okay. He doesn't start teaching until 10+ minutes after class starts. His slides are quotes from articles, not notes. He's too smart to teach. At least there's a study guide that makes tests easy."
2183,2009594,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Kallfelz is a brilliant professor who is certainly passionate. That being said, he does tend to lack structure and his lectures can be very confusing and/or overwhelming, in part due to his large vocabulary. However, he does answer questions thoroughly and the textbook is very useful for deciphering some of his more complicated lectures."
2184,2009594,2.0,5.0,"I'm sure he is a great guy. He is very passionate about teaching. But he rambles on &amp; on &amp; never makes sense (esp. for me, someone who couldn't understand his large vocabulary). You take quizzes--which i rarely did well on. Also, there are discussion days for a grade but no one (maybe 4 people) gets to talk because he talks the entire time..."
2185,2009594,2.0,3.0,"Doesn't really cover relevant information but talks the whole entire time. He does care about the subject but tends to not be able to communicate it well. Exam reviews are confusing, simply because he doesn't cover it well during lectures. I did do well in the class but I wouldn't suggest taking him."
2186,2009594,2.0,3.0,"Usually talks the entire time and somehow doesn't give any relevant info. Slides are a mess. Attendance is mandatory. On discussion days, hardly leaves room for students to talk even though it's a participation grade. Overall he cares about the subject but doesn't make it interesting or even communicate it well. Makes this class harder than need be"
2187,2009594,4.0,2.0,"He is a brilliant man and because of this he uses a very large vocabulary that sometimes may be hard to follow. Great teacher, easy grader, and very caring of every individual in the class."
2188,2009594,1.0,3.0,"This has honestly been the worst class I have taken in my college career. Dr. Kallfelz is very smart, no doubt, but doesn't know how to translate that into teaching. His lectures are one long breath without pause for clarification or to check if anyone actually understands anything he says. Grade wise, I did well in the class, but learned nothing."
2189,1665553,5.0,4.0,"She was a great professor! Keep up with the work, and you will be fine! I ended the course with a high A, but put in a good amount of time and effort into the class each week!"
2190,1665553,4.0,2.0,"The class provided material which was straight forward but did require you to do the homework if you're to understand it. She is also available to respond to questions via email anytime, which is good if you've waited until the last minute to do the homework."
2191,1665553,4.5,2.0,I took this class online and her quizzes and tests were very fair.  The material tested was directly related to the study material.  I would definitely recommend this professor.
2192,756241,5.0,2.0,"Best teacher I have had... Ever.  He explained concepts well, was humorous, gave relevant assignments, and tests reflected material covered and homeworks.  I wish I could have taken him for more classes."
2193,756241,4.5,4.0,Extremely quick to respond to emails. Tries to help but doesn't always try to explain things in a new light. Study guides on tests are very helpful.
2194,756241,4.5,4.0,I have a good memory of his class. But you have to work hard during semester.
2195,756241,4.5,4.0,He teaches hard subjects so his classes are never easy.  He does work and think fast though.  He generally nice and helpful.
2196,756241,2.5,5.0,"He works problems in class at the speed of sound.  You never have time to comprehend what he's saying because your pencil is moving so fast.  Study sessions were good, but tests were still very hard.  I asked for help with homework a few times but didn't really feel like he wanted to help. I wouldn't take him again unless I had no other choice."
2197,756241,3.0,4.0,He's a jerk. Doesn't allow enough time on tests. Goes very fast and doesn't explain very well. Expects you to know everything because he's like a friggin' genius.
2198,2517537,4.0,3.0,"Good guy. Has an air of almost-superiority about him but it's so benign you start to forget to notice it. Posts the notes online and gives a study guide for every test. Class can get a little Mormon at times, but other than that no complaints."
2199,2517537,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Page is very kind and very willing to help students succeed. If he thinks you are going in the wrong direction, he will help you no matter what. The mid-term is very hard, everyone fails it so don't worry, it's not a big chunk of your grade. I really enjoyed his class and learned a lot!"
2200,2517537,5.0,3.0,"A very good professor, willing to help any time you're stuck or having trouble. He does a great job of understanding that this is probably his students' first time working with statistical research, and grades pretty leniently because of it. He also gives plenty of opportunity to revise assignments. He also gives great life advice every lecture."
2201,2714153,1.0,5.0,I took him for Comp 1 and 2 which was my biggest mistake in life. Literally expects you to know all of his grading  criteria when he literally cancels class almost every week. Comp 2 seemed like we did the same thing over and over again with no good feedback in return. DO NOT TAKE HIM especially if you're not a good writer. 
2202,2714153,1.0,5.0,"0/10 would not recommend this professor. He preaches wanting to help his students, but does not act on this. Very repetitive class - get ready to write 5 papers on the same topic & he does not full explain what he wants. expects his students to read his mind - get ready for a tough grader who does not care if you pass/fail "
2203,2714153,5.0,3.0,"this is my second time taking Mr Pound's class, took comp 1 and 2 with him. great teacher and genuinely cares about his students and their well-being. would 10000% recommend this teacher to anyone taking comp 1 and 2"
2204,2714153,5.0,4.0,"He always makes a point to truly see if his students are doing well. Work can be overwhelming, but thats true for any comp class. Makes lots of good jokes and gives out lots of easy bonus points."
2205,2714153,5.0,4.0,Mr. Pounds is the best English instructor! He really cares about his students and what we are going through. He really likes in-class discussion about the material and essays. He expects a lot out of you but will help you succeed! He also gives extra credit if you show up and read the required material for class.
2206,2714153,5.0,3.0,"If you consistently show up to class and ask questions you should pass. He gave tons of extra credit for just showing up for class, all you really have to do is just pay attention and try to work ahead. He also gave multiple extensions to the entire class when needed. He gives very clear instructions and has all of the important info on canvas."
2207,2714153,2.0,3.0,Doesnt fully explain what to work on and then grades ridiculously hard
2208,2714153,5.0,3.0,"English with Mr. Pounds was super chill, I always felt very comfortable in his class, and he really makes it a safe space for his students. The biggest thing I'd say is SHOW UP TO CLASS. He's steady on attendance and calls it manually each day, but he gives out extra points all the time for people who show up. There is a presentation at the end."
2209,2714153,5.0,3.0,overall great teacher gave fantastic feedback on all drafts of each paper. was very helpful outside of class as well and encouraged students to reach out. cared about all students and was very lenient. would 1000% take him again. lots of open class discussions and didn't feel pressured to talk in class. very laid back
2210,1141301,5.0,4.0,He is the best professor ever!
2211,1141301,4.5,4.0,Best professor in Aerospace
2212,1141301,4.5,3.0,No Comments
2213,2533957,5.0,3.0,Ms. Ana is a wonderful teacher. Her tests and quizzes are fairly easy if you come to class and pay attention. She is caring and very easy-going. Her class is a very welcoming environment
2214,2533957,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Ana is a great teacher! She's technically a Graduate Student, but she's great at helping us understand concepts. She actually takes time to explain how and why things work, and offers help outside of class by email if needed. She's great!"
2215,2435654,4.0,2.0,"Wong is a great professor. Attendance is important, but he does post slides on Canvas. Every once in a while he would give extra credit (few points). The tests weren't super easy but he curved all of my classes' tests almost every time. **DONT LET PRP CATCH UP ON YOU &amp; IT'S AN EASY A**"
2216,2435654,5.0,3.0,"Wong is awesome. He always let me make up assignments when I missed class. The tests were hard but he always curved and tried to make them easier the next time. Went fairly slow so you could take notes and showed videos to further explain hard concepts. Also, assignments were extremely easy and this man gave a lot of extra credit points. 10/10."
2217,2533961,5.0,3.0,"He's a grad student, but he's a great teacher. He gives a lot of definitions in lectures that are slightly different from the book, so I don't think reading is NECESSARY, but it certainly helped me get an A+. There are also plenty of opportunities to boost your grade! Fantastic professor, definitely recommend him, just pay attention in class!"
2218,1149513,5.0,1.0,Awesome dude by far my favorite professor 
2219,1149513,5.0,2.0,Dr. French is an amazing prof. He is very nice and he will work with you on your grade. He usually lets class out early. I definitely recommend his class.
2220,1149513,4.0,2.0,Took him for biofuels. He teaches everything you need to know for the tests in great detail. The concepts are pretty easy to grasp. I would recommend it above the others for CHE elecive.
2221,1149513,3.0,3.0,"French doesn't give the most useful lectures or work many examples, but considering &quot;teach yourself&quot; is the mantra of the entire department you might as well get used to it. At least French is accessible to answer questions and doesn't destroy you on the tests."
2222,1149513,1.0,4.0,"Never showed up to class. The worst professor in a department of bad professors. If you want to learn chemical engineering at Mississippi State, I wouldn't bother attending here at all. Unorganized and horrible. A disgrace to the university."
2223,1149513,3.5,1.0,"Had him for seminar. Every week was a discussion on how females were discriminated against. Otherwise, mediocre professor."
2224,1149513,5.0,1.0,One of the best teachers I've ever had. He loves teaching and it shows.
2225,1149513,5.0,2.0,Awesome teacher
2226,2034252,4.0,3.0,"Lovely class and lovely professor. He worked hard to make us success. Gave extra credits. Attendance was mandatory to get privilege of dropping two lowest quizzes and one homework grades, also to replace lowest test grade by final test grade. Zero grade could not drop so do not miss any of them. :) :) :)"
2227,2034252,5.0,3.0,He is a very good professor. Easily one of the best professor I have had in my physics class. He truly cares about his students and gives every possible chance to success. He is super passionate about his job and I would highly recommend him over anyone else.
2228,2034252,5.0,1.0,Awesome professor. Highly recommended. Do not escape more than 3 classes then you will be fine. If you escape more than 3 classes and miss any homework or quiz then he will be tough. Tests contain multiple choice questions and problems. What he covered in the class and homework will be in tests and quizzes so do not miss them.
2229,2034252,5.0,1.0,"This is a Professor who clearly loves his job and cares about his students. If you attend class regularly, he gives you every opportunity to succeed. Getting A is not hard if you are regular in his class, submit all homeworks and present in all quizzes. Highly recommend."
2230,2034252,4.0,2.0,"Great professor. He assigns homework and takes quiz for ever chapter and if you do not miss any, there is no reason you can't get an A in the class. If you have any problems, he is more than willing to help you understand it. He has 2 quizzes and 1 homework drop policy but don't expect to drop 0 grade if you miss any. Prepare to attend all classes."
2231,2034252,4.0,2.0,"Good TA, very helpful. Always works together with students."
2232,2034252,4.5,2.0,He is awesome profession. He has little bit problem in English but you will learn a lot from his course. He is very helpful and inspirational one.
2233,2034252,4.5,1.0,He is a good instructor. Explain materials well and very helpful.
2234,1608269,2.0,3.0,"She is the Poly Sci graduate director. She is not available to her students and even said that she didn't have time. Not helpful. Should understand that her job IS to be there for students, no matter the situation."
2235,2533969,4.0,1.0,"She gives a lot of homework and in class assignments, so it's easy to get a good grade as long as you do them. Half of the tests are online tests, and the vocabulary quizzes are online, making them pretty easy. No need to read if you show up to class, and she's super nice and understanding if you have issues. Good teacher overall!"
2236,1608273,5.0,3.0,He was the best!! The test questions come directly from the study guide he gives you the week of the test. Highly highly recommend.  
2237,1608273,4.0,1.0,Doesn't answer emails. You have 4 tests but they are super easy. They are the study guide exactly. I never made below a 90 on his tests and I always studied for maybe an hour the night before every time. Super easy but you have to do well on tests because there are no other grades. Gives a few extra credit opportunities.  
2238,1608273,5.0,2.0,Dr. Shoup is an amazing professor and gives you the opportunity to earn extra credit for your test. There is no homework so it is strictly test-based. The tests are easy and he is able to help with you. 
2239,1608273,5.0,1.0,His class is VERY easy. He posts his slides on canvas. Also gives a study guide which is extremely similar to the actual tests. All the tests are in person and multiple choice. He offers extra credit and he is also very nice and willing to help. 
2240,1608273,5.0,2.0,"Very kind and caring professor. Tests make up all the assignments, so they are weighed heavily. Great lectures, very engaging and hilarious. For political science majors, I highly recommend you take this as an introductory course. If you have a chance to take Dr. Shoup do it!!"
2241,1608273,1.0,3.0,"This was the most boring class I have ever took. Attendance isn't mandatory but it is nice to go. He doesn't give any extra credit either. His lectures are so boring, so only take this class if you need it."
2242,1608273,4.0,2.0,"literally the funniest teacher i have ever had. always behind on what he was supposed to be teaching, but adjusted the tests for that reason"
2243,1608273,5.0,3.0,"I took this class as an elective and loved it. He was easy going and made it interesting. Fair grader, available to answer questions."
2244,1608273,3.0,1.0,4 quizzes  FInal grade Rock the test Pass the class. I didn't study and made an 89 just listen a day before the quizzes.
2245,1608273,5.0,3.0,"I love my major, and this professor is why. Dr. Shoup is my absolute favorite professor I've ever had at State- and there's a lot of good ones at this school. You can tell he cares about the subject on which he's lecturing, and he loves to teach and help you actually understand the topic. He's a little intense at first, but absolutely worth taking."
2246,1608273,5.0,1.0,One of the best professors I have had at MSU. He is very knowledgeable about the subject and knows how to attract and keep the attention of his students. I learned a lot in his class and had a lot of fun while learning. I do recommend him. The only regret I have is that I only had the chance to take two classes with him before graduating.
2247,1608273,4.5,1.0,"One of the main reasons I switched to Political Science. He is a great teacher and guy. Tells random stories during lectures, but they are interesting and funny. Very passionate about what he teaches."
2248,1608273,4.0,3.0,"VERY interesting guy who keeps your attention. However, he does not always do a good job of getting to the subject matter. he kind of tells a story versus discussing the subject matter. And, the story is not what you will be tested on. Very entertaining though and a good guy"
2249,2796124,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Tian's lectures contain the details necessary to do well in her classes, so if succeeding is what you want, then paying attention to the content of her lectures is integral to getting an A+ (more importantly learning the content)."
2250,2050655,4.0,4.0,"She is passionate about teaching and thinks you should be as well. She has very high expectations, but she guides you to where you need to be if you are willing to work hard and keep up with assignments. Don't slack off or cheat. She will call you out on it."
2251,2050655,4.0,4.0,Lots of work and projects - get ready to work hard and say goodbye to your social life!
2252,1632870,5.0,3.0,Dr. Zuckerman is the best at what she does. Her lectures are comprehensible and easy to keep up with. She gives lots of extra credit and lets you know ahead of time what is going to be on the test.
2253,1632870,5.0,3.0,I love Dr. Z! Taking her class was the best thing I've done. She is definitely one of my favorite professors at MSU. TONS of extra credit and fun projects. She tells you what is expected for the test. There is no blind-siding.
2254,1632870,5.0,3.0,"There are lots of readings assigned but as long as you show up and listen, they aren't really needed. For this class (Biology and Culture), there were weekly tweets and facebook posts we had to do (on the class topic) to teach us how to write professional posts and engage people. She is a super caring professor. 10/10 would recommend"
2255,1632870,5.0,3.0,"Such an amazing teacher! She makes topics that seem boring so interesting. There were 2 big projects, daily discussion questions, and 2 take home tests (one of them was the final). If you are willing to do the work and are interesting then this class will be super easy. Attendance is taken but not for a grade."
2256,1632870,5.0,2.0,Dr. Zuckerman is amazing! The textbook is helpful and you are supposed to read every nigh but if you understand the lecture you don't need to. She makes it so easy to do well. Attendance is taken but nit counted for a grade but her class is so amazing that you wot want to miss it.
2257,1632870,4.0,2.0,Dr. Zuckerman's great and this is a super easy class. She teaches well and makes it very clear what's on the test. There is a lot of extra credit opportunities. I didn't really use the textbook even though there were assigned readings and reading quizzes. Each one just had three kind of obvious true or false questions.
2258,1632870,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Makes class interesting, but I would say one thing. She'll tell you you just have to be familiar with terms for test and not actually memorize. Trust me, memorize."
2259,1632870,5.0,4.0,Dr. Zuckerman creates an interesting class setting. She caters to all types of learners in her lectures and test. Dr. Zuckerman is a tough grader when it comes to papers. Follow her advice when it comes to writing your papers. If you are having trouble with the course she is willing to help. This is a fantastic course for Anthropology Majors!
2260,1632870,4.5,3.0,"Very enjoyable, definitely knows her stuff, and very understanding."
2261,1632870,4.5,3.0,"She's not necessarily a difficult teacher, but she does expect you to have both read and paid attention, but she offers plenty of help to those willing to take advantage of it."
2262,1632870,3.5,5.0,She is a good teacher but her test are really hard. If you are interested in lot of reading than you should take this class.
2263,281195,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lam genuinely cares about his students. While Stats II is tough, he gives you every opportunity to understand, as long as  you make an effort. His exams aren't that bad if you work through his practice tests, and everything he says or hands out in class is online. The only downside is that he is a little difficult to understand."
2264,281195,2.0,3.0,"He is very enthusiastic about the subject, however he can hard to understand because English is not his primary language. I found it hard to stay interested, and hard to learn because of the language barrier. His test are very tough, however he gives students a good opportunity to make a good grade in the course. "
2265,281195,3.5,3.0,"Love Dr. Lam! Stat is hard but he really tries to make it easier. He explain everything ahead of time so you won't be confused. He gives us study guides for pretty much everything. Book is not required but be prepared to take a comprehensive final. Managed to an A, you can too! :)"
2266,281195,2.5,3.0,"Dr. Lam and his squirrel jokes were pretty funny, but I took him in the summer which he piled a whole bunch of papers as he teaches. He does that give partial credit on the homework and quizzes. And exams in the library teacher reserve. If you are organized and understand you will be fine."
2267,281195,4.0,3.0,He's funny. Gives homework. His exams are based on old exams found in the library. You have lab work also.
2268,281195,2.0,4.0,"This is probably the worst teacher I have had. I feel like everything I learned, I learned on my own. If you are not self motivated and dedicated, do not take this class."
2269,281195,1.5,5.0,If you can learn Statistics without the teacher working practice equations on the board then that is great.
2270,281195,4.5,2.0,"I LOVE Dr. Lam...he tells funny jokes and he loves my grandma. Very, very nice guy. Love his calss...got an A too."
2271,281195,4.5,3.0,He is hilarious and is very willing to help you if you do not understand something.  I recommend taking him.  His previous tests are stored in the library and his new tests are almost identical to the old ones.
2272,281195,5.0,3.0,"Very good professor and very intelligent person.  Very helpful when students have problems.  Expect a class that will make it easy for you to learn, but not an easy class."
2273,772715,4.5,2.0,As long as she sees you trying she will help you. Very nice lady!Easy class
2274,772715,4.0,4.0,No Comments
2275,772715,4.0,4.0,"I enjoyed this class very much.  I thought the teacher was helpful.  I couldn't stand how people in the class kept getting hung up on thier religion.  It was certainly a lot of work for me, and it was a good experience."
2276,772715,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Philips is great at giving the test questions out the class before the test on WebCT.  They relate to the homework, and if you pay attention to her in class, its really easy. She makes the discussions fun, and interesting, even when your talking about reletively boring people, the first two weeks of class."
2277,2689651,2.0,4.0,Barely teaches material. Gives accurate practice exams. normally gives extra credit. Graded on only 2 Exams (Midterm and Final). Very nice. I hear he's better in other classes though. Study what each algorithm does and its time complexity and you should be fine.
2278,2689651,5.0,3.0,"The professor knows a lot about the material and stays after class to answer questions. Grade IS calculated by only midterm and final; however, in recent years, he has given extra credit in the case you have a bad exam day. The material is on YouTube, so as long as you're going to class and studying, the exams are not difficult. Attend class!"
2279,2689651,3.0,4.0,Only grades are midterm and final. Absolutely do the extra credit. Hit up classmates who've taken the class for old tests. Have a good understanding of the practice midterm and final. Memorize each algorithm you've learned and each of its traits and its time complexity for the midterm. Occasional bonus points for attendance.
2280,2689651,2.0,4.0,Two tests are entire grade. Doesn't give things to practice on. He himself doesn't fully grasp the material.
2281,2198134,5.0,3.0,"Lots of extra credit opportunities. It is hard to fail this class (you should get an A with minimal stress/work). one of my fave prof of all time. She is good at lecturing and helping you. Exam 2 is the most difficult. Final is NOT cumulative. 2 projects which take a little time, but are meant to help your grade. 9 discussion papers to read (easy)"
2282,2738822,5.0,2.0,"She is a wonderful person and will make sure each student is following the material well. There is no tests, only papers and in class assignments. She explains exactly what she is looking for in the grading process and helps you when you reach out. The only reason I don't have an A is because I did not turn in a paper :(."
2283,2738822,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Murdock was an amazing Comp professor. She explained all her assignments in a lot of detail and always responds to emails in less than 24 hours. Very, sweet lady who made 8 AMs a lot of fun!"
2284,2738822,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Murdock is hands down the best professor, at least from what I've seen. I never struggled in her class as she thoroughly explained all of the assignments and was very responsive to questions. My peers who had other profs. struggled more. She breaks down essays into different parts, making it easy to manage essays into your schedule."
2285,2738822,4.0,3.0,"Mrs. Murdock is great at teaching English Comp I. Attendance is not mandatory, but if you want a good grade, you have to go to get in-class assignment points. She is very clear with instructions and explains concepts well. She is friendly and always wants to help if you have questions or issues outside of class."
2286,2345611,4.0,2.0,Professor Moseley is very chill but she sure has a passion for literature. Her lectures are very class-involved and she builds a good relationship with her students. She is somewhat scatter-brained so be prepared to feel kind of lost at some points. She assigns a few papers and group projects and tests but just read your stories and you'll be fine!
2287,2345611,5.0,3.0,The best professor I have had at MSU so far. She cares about me as a person and wants me to succeed. Gives extra credit for using the writing center. Will push deadlines back on papers if students are struggling. Gives class time for library research on the exploratory paper. LOVE Ms Moseley! Would HIGHLY recommend her for freshman comp.
2288,1944210,3.5,1.0,"Overall he is a great professor; however, sometimes he is very unclear on exactly how he wants you to structure your paper."
2289,1165976,4.0,3.0,"She is now Thompson, not Mann. She is very helpful, especially when you have missed due to emergencies. Is clear in instruction and answers all questions. "
2290,1165976,4.0,2.0,Every assignment is a paper of some sort. She grades everything very fairly.
2291,1165976,3.5,2.0,No Comments
2292,166590,4.0,2.0,"She was decent, very thorough in lecture.  Just do your homework and its easy."
2293,166590,2.0,5.0,"Accounting is my major and I took my first class with her. I made a decent grade somehow, but my knowledge is not equal to my grade. She doesn't explain anything in class and expects you to know what she's talking about. It is hard to understand her talking and read her handwriting so don't expect to learn during class time. Read the book."
2294,166590,4.0,3.0,"Dr. McNair is a pretty good teacher. Some of the things she tries to teach are difficult to understand, but part of that is just because of the difficulty of the class in general. She gives a good bit of homework though, but it usually is not super time consuming. Plus, she gives a little extra credit. Tests are tough though."
2295,166590,4.0,3.0,"In class she was a great lecturer. She explains the material very well. I was disappointed with how she handled the online portion of this semester, though. She wasnt very involved after that"
2296,166590,5.0,4.0,"Dr. McNair is amazing. I had her for Principles of Financial Accounting. I cannot stress how good she is and how well she covers the materials. There is a lot of studying, but welcome to accounting. I would put her as one of the best and nicest teachers I've ever had. TAKE HER!!!!"
2297,166590,4.5,4.0,"If you're a tax major, you have to take McNair for several classes. If taxes aren't your thing and your looking at taking this as an elective... I wouldn't! If you put in the effort, McNair will help you as much as she can. Her tests are difficult and I don't recommend missing more than once or twice, and only with good reason!"
2298,166590,1.0,5.0,i found mcnair to be a little pretentious and moved very fast she wrote the book she uses and i found the book to be as difficult to follow as her lectures i would highly advise if you are not an accounting major take someone else.
2299,166590,4.5,3.0,Great teacher! Her review sessions are well worth attending. Her handwriting is awful so you have to listen as she writes to follow along but she definitely knows what she's talking about! I would highly recommend her for any accounting class!
2300,166590,3.5,3.0,"McNair wrote the textbook so, you better believe she uses it. And the (optional) workbook is WELL worth the money, so GET IT. She's a stickler for absences but coming to class is really not an option for you if you want to do good on the tests. Talks fast, but really knows the material and helps you to comprehend it too."
2301,166590,5.0,3.0,Very nice teacher who will do anything for the students to help them pass the course.
2302,166590,4.5,3.0,Dr. McNair is very knowledgeable in her subject matter and is always willing to answer student's questions.  I really enjoyed her classes!
2303,166590,5.0,3.0,She is an incredible teacher that goes out of her way to make sure the students learn the material.
2304,2714304,3.0,1.0,"Extremely easy class; take it if you want a good grade. A lot of class participation discussions, weekly reading quizzes, and group projects. There are many extra credit opportunities as well. "
2305,2714304,3.0,1.0,"She does give you a lot of extra credit and the class is easy. However, she does just teach on her point of view and does not try to stay neutral. She only teaches her point of view and makes the other point of views looks bad. "
2306,2714304,5.0,1.0,Easy quizzes and engaging lectures.
2307,2714304,4.0,1.0,Very simple quizzes and engaging class sessions.
2308,2714304,5.0,1.0,Ms. Phillips always made class super interesting and she is truly passionate about what she is teaching. Her class was really easy if you put forth effort. Highly recommend!
2309,2714304,5.0,2.0,"Really good professor. Shes younger so more relatable to topics. She used lots of videos which were really useful, would even show them to people outside of class. The class is easy if you put in minimum effort and lots of extra credit."
2310,2714304,5.0,2.0,"She is amazing inside the classroom, truly cares about her srudents. But, she also undertsands we have a lot of crap to do and so does she. Give MANY extra credit things all throghout the semester. Would most definetly take her again!"
2311,2714304,5.0,2.0,"Best teacher I have had so far! Her lectures are super interesting. Gives study guides for test. tons of extra credit. weekly quizzes, but the questions are copied to the tests. do the reading guides and the quizzes are super easy. I made a 107 and 103 on the tests so far. would take again in a heartbeat. really cares about her students"
2312,2714304,5.0,2.0,"Lectures are interesting. She really ensures that you understand the material. Weekly quizzes, but you have to read to do good. The test are easy."
2313,2714304,5.0,2.0,She is super nice and really cares for her students. This class is pretty easy as long as you read and pay attention in class. Lectures are very entertaining and she does a great job at relating materials covered in class to our day to day lives. All in all a great professor!
2314,830145,5.0,2.0,Prof Kirkland is the sweetest person ever. It's obvious that she loves what she is teaching. The tests aren't hard if you do the study guides. She uploads the powerpoints to canvas but sometimes she gives extra points to people who come to class.
2315,830145,5.0,2.0,"Make sure to participate in class, sometimes she gives out extra credit for simply being there and asking questions. She releases the study guides and the notes. Memorization is key. If you're in the honors section, three of the four essays are required. She's a super fun teacher, who is passionate about the subject and cares about her students."
2316,830145,3.0,2.0,Dr. Brenda is very passionate about Earth Science. She realizes that most people take the course for a non-math science credit so she makes it an easier course. She has many quirks. Your attendance is important not because of lecture(she post online) but because she will drop your grade if you do not attend class. Test are straight forward.
2317,830145,4.0,3.0,I really the class. Dr. Brenda is a great professor.
2318,830145,5.0,1.0,Very interesting and very easy!!! If you can take her instead of Dr. Dewey for the love of God take Dr. Kirkland and DONT call her Dr. Kirkland its Dr. Brenda. You rule!!!
2319,830145,5.0,3.0,The best geology teacher you will ever have!
2320,830145,5.0,3.0,:)
2321,830145,5.0,1.0,really friendly and personable
2322,830145,5.0,1.0,She is a very easy teacher because she explains things in ways that everyone can understand them.  Her tests come straight from her powerpoint lectures and she gives reviews and study guides before every test.
2323,166594,4.0,4.0,"This class had a lot of homework and the tests were hard and graded hard. I don't think anyone ever made higher than a B on a test, but I learned A LOT in this class. One of the most useful classes for accounting majors and Dr. Lehman put a lot of work into the instructor videos. After graduating, you will be thankful for how hard this class was."
2324,166594,5.0,3.0,"Dr Lehman will help you in any way possible, IF he sees that you are putting in the work. The worst part of the class are the tests. Be sure you understand how to complete tasks exactly how he wants them done. These won't be included in the instructions and the are counted wrong if you don't."
2325,166594,5.0,4.0,Dr Lehman was a wonderful professor. I still apply principles learned in his class over 15 years later.
2326,166594,3.0,3.0,Good teaching and very nice.
2327,166594,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Lehman is a great accountant and the videos are a very useful learning tool.  Sometimes directions become sort of unclear, but that's mainly because he's trying to push you to figure it out on your own."
2328,166594,4.0,2.0,The class was fairly easy and we only met once a week.  Just do the work he assigns and you should do fine.
2329,166594,2.5,4.0,"The class seemed to be easy at the beginning, but then he starts giving tests on stuff that he never clearly taught."
2330,166594,3.0,3.0,No Comments
2331,166594,2.0,2.0,"Dr. Lehman definately knows what he is doing, but is a very difficult teacher.  He is unclear with instructions which make it difficult to meet his high standards.  Don't be suprised if you come out of his class never wanting to have him again."
2332,166594,3.0,3.0,Dr. Lehman is not a very hard teacher but is very unclear about what he needs from the student to get a certain grade.  Take a B or better and run!!
2333,2837184,2.0,3.0,"Little time in-between papers to learn how to write over a whole new concept. Also, on top of the short time between papers we start a new one before we even finish the paper before. Nice teacher, just be prepared for late nights of work and the papers to determine your grade."
2334,1886916,2.0,1.0,"If you miss two days, he drops you a letter grade. Four days is two letter grades. The course is really boring and not what I thought it would be. Not a fun class at all, but you can get an A if you come every day and take exact notes. He shows videos at the end of class that I would rather endure physical pain than watch."
2335,1845984,5.0,1.0,"She is by far the best professor in the CFR. She loves her job and her passion flows from what she is talking about to what you are learning about. Everything she teaches is easy to understand and the class is very easy. She tells you what's going to be on the test and you just need the powerpoint notes, which are all posted."
2336,1166083,3.0,4.0,"Very nice guy, not the greatest prof, but he is very understandable and is always there to help answer questions. Gets a lot of hate but I really liked the guy."
2337,1166083,1.5,2.0,"Egotistical, nice guy outside of class, Tests are bogus, talks about his life more than architecture, very hard to please, soft spoken, picky, in studio classes over uses the word vignette... etc. He is a nice guy, not a great professor."
2338,1166083,4.0,3.0,"He seems very strange at first. However, he has knowledge about architecture and he is always there to help you out. I do not think he is a bad teacher. I like him."
2339,1166083,1.0,3.0,"LOUSY, yet in an out of the box rock star kind of a way AWFUL"
2340,1166083,1.0,3.0,"Total ?out of the box? ?im a rock star?, ?at the end of the day? ?mute point? clichés ****! In other works a big over educated FAKE!"
2341,2386708,3.0,4.0,"Leslie is cool,but I swear she grades so freaking hard but I also believe her grading has helped my writing in a way and I really appreciate her."
2342,2386708,5.0,2.0,Good teacher for intro to lit. Youll only do 3 papers. Tests are the same as her study guides. At the end of the semester youll study Hamilton and its a breeze. Remember to do your online responses and have outlines for your essays
2343,2632470,5.0,5.0,"Is a challenging class, but dr. France is available most of the time through email. He wont straight up give answers (which i like) but will help a lot with code. The first week or two is rough but after you get used to it, its not that bad. Grades fairly. Use classmates as resources"
2344,1239847,5.0,2.0,Took 2 of his classes.  His tests are straightforward and really easy. I think really highly of Weiss.  He's one of the few intellectuals in the department yet is really down to earth.  Most people really like him. Definitely take his class if you can.  I wish there were more prof's like this guy.
2345,2100009,3.0,2.0,"Overall, pretty good lecturer. Makes his material easy to follow, and gives helpful examples. However, be prepared for homework questions that you were not prepared for on quizzes. He also posts his own lecture notes online, and that is extremely helpful. once you get used to reading the right side of the page first."
2346,437037,1.0,4.0,"Extremely rude,  condescending. He even said he could hack students accounts. Insinuated a student had porn on their computer. Overall a terrible professor and should have been fired years ago.  "
2347,437037,1.0,3.0,Told students they'd be nothing without a degree and he'd see them at McDonalds. Assigned homework before teaching it just so we'd &quot;know what mistakes to fix&quot;. He didn't follow MSU Covid guidelines. He canceled class because he had a migraine from having a nightmare but didn't count a snow storm or hospitalization as a valid excuse for students.
2348,437037,1.0,2.0,"He likes to embarrass his students. He's very egocentric and is just generally not a good person. He pretends to care at times, but it's pretty easy to see through. The class wasn't hard, and I earned a good grade, but this review isn't about the class so much itself rather than it is a review on the kind of person Dr. Human is. I don't recommend."
2349,437037,1.0,3.0,"He pretends to be quirky and lively, but it's really just a front that hides the fact that in all actuality, this guy's a jerk. When people start asking questions and he doesn't know the answers, he responds with &quot;I'm glad we're geeking out about this!&quot; No dude, we're not &quot;geeking out.&quot; You don't know what you're talking about."
2350,437037,1.0,1.0,"Dr. Human is funny, but some of the things he says can be hurtful and embarrassing in front of the class. Beware of pop tests- these are tests that are usually 1 minute on the assigned reading for that class- a concept not yet taught. Its not in the syllabus, but yeah, its a test grade. Hell criticize your homework in class. Hell call you out"
2351,437037,3.5,1.0,"Richard Human is great. He is very passionate about music, and you can tell by the way he teaches. Tests are all online and are not at all difficult. Only negative would be that he never answers emails."
2352,437037,4.5,1.0,No Comments
2353,437037,4.5,2.0,"Class was fun and interesting.  The only problem I had was he would tell us something like &quot;the test will be 25 multiple choice&quot; and it turned out to be short answer/essay.  He did give curves, so it wasn't too bad."
2354,1813304,4.0,5.0,Hard grader
2355,1813304,5.0,3.0,She knows what she wants but she makes sure that you know what shes looking for. Shes a pretty tough grader and is nitpicky with writing but I can confidently say I came out of her class a better writer. She is very accessible and was willing to help me with any questions. She loves when students participate in class discussion.
2356,1813304,5.0,2.0,"Dr. McKinley is the best professor I have ever had. Extremely competent regarding the subject matter. Pushes you to be your best, but sets fair & reasonable expectations. She doesn't put up with crap or stupidity, but in a good way. She is amazing."
2357,1813304,2.5,2.0,She herself does not make class hard. Test are straightforward and grades fairly. What makes it hard is that we have discussion every day and never get to the actual material.
2358,1813304,2.5,3.0,"She is a nice teacher, most of the time. Her tests are generally easy if you actually study. She can be kinda rude though with the way she looks at you and responds."
2359,1813305,4.0,4.0,"Be prepared to work on your papers and always submit early for review !!!!
"
2360,1813305,4.0,4.0,She's a great instructor and very helpful. She helped me on many levels and is someone to truly to learn from. Do what is instructed and ask questions and you should pass.
2361,1813305,5.0,4.0,Jada is a great teacher. She makes class fun and it is a class i look forward to. She is passionate about the subject matter and its a hands-on class instead of her just talking all the time.
2362,1813308,3.0,2.0,"Dr. P was a good teacher. She made us laugh a lot and made the material interesting. Sometimes i wasn't quite sure what was on the test because she didn't make it clear, but besides that she was a good teacher"
2363,2222912,5.0,1.0,"This is unmistakably the easiest class I've ever taken. It may be harder in person, but online it was great. I did all the discussion posts and tests while at work and was still able to focus at work. He also let us work ahead so I did an entire winter session of work in a few days."
2364,2222912,3.0,1.0,"You have to attend his class, but every test (midterm and final only) and all quizes (3 a week, and some times a discussion board) are all done online. As long as you have the text book, you will make an A. Every question is word for word found in the text book."
2365,2394945,1.0,5.0,"I would not recommend anyone take this lady. I had her for Comp II this Spring semester. EXTREMELY UNORGANIZED! She does terrible with getting to her students! If you emailed her during the day, she would email you at 12 AM after you went to bed. She literally told the class I was in that we dont give her space! She isnt teacher worthy!"
2366,2394945,1.0,5.0,DO NOT take her for English Comp. She would swap up grade due dates so you would never know when a paper was due and was extremely unorganized when it came to grading. Extremely tough grader and was terrible at explaining concepts in class.
2367,2394945,1.0,5.0,"I expected to fly through my Freshman comps as I've always been a strong writer and proofreader. I blew through Comp 1 and expected Comp 2 to go smoothly, but this woman made my experience literal hell. She literally told me if I'd been in another class section I would've had a higher grade... Messed up my GPA, and I worked hard every day for it."
2368,2394945,2.0,4.0,"I would not reccomend Ms. Baumgartner. She's a nice lady, but I cannot stand her class. I've always loved writing, and I thought I was pretty good at it, but she killed that. It seems like I could never please her with my writing, which has never been a problem for me in any other english class. Too much busy work. Last minute on instructions."
2369,2394945,2.0,4.0,Writing is an understandable aspect of an English Composition class. I write a lot in my spare time and Comp1 proved to not be an issue. This class has way too many writing assignments. The required work with each assignment is overkill and she gives nearly last minute instructions. I gave up on trying to complete any papers early due to late info.
2370,2083652,3.0,4.0,"This is just a hard course. You need to start studying for the tests honestly no less than a week before. You are allowed a cheat sheet on the test, which helps, but you still need to know the material to be able to use the cheat sheet."
2371,2370373,2.0,3.0,"Lectures are pretty bad but so much extra credit. Partial credit for late work, you can discuss exams for points, and lots of extra points throughout class. HW average replaces lowest test grade at the end of the year. Quizzes are pass/fail so if you get > half right you get a 100. Easy to make a good grade, but the actual teaching is not so good."
2372,2370373,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Ari can be kinda rough to get used to at first due to the occasional language barrier, and his handwriting (uses traditional chalk) is kinda hard to read. However, he obviously cares about his students and wants you to succeed. He's understanding, gives extensions, bonus if the test is too difficult, etc. Plus, his demonstrations are funny."
2373,2370373,5.0,4.0,He can be difficult to understand at times but he has a dry sense of humor and makes the lessons interesting with his demonstrations. His study guides are just like the test and he gives you chances to get credit back.
2374,2370373,1.0,3.0,Horrible professor. Dr. Ari knows fixes well but speaks broken English and cant explain the concept. Also while being asked questions in class or after class either avoided the question or didnt answer the question. Avoid at all cost. Seriously. Avoid.
2375,2370373,4.0,3.0,"Definitely a hard subject but he is funny and a good professor to take if you already have a decent physics background. Homework was hard every week but he made it up for it on the tests which were very similar to the practice tests. Also is willing to give points back on tests. Kind of hard to understand, but he tried his best."
2376,2370373,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Ari knows physics very well, but he is not an effective teacher. Does not speak English very well, and he barely teaches the material. He will go through a whole chapter in less than two classes even when the chapter may have 10 different sections. He does give practice test before the actual test though."
2377,2370373,1.0,5.0,"First, I will say it is obvious this dude knows physics. However, I don't. Dr. Ari speaks English very poorly, and has a terrible technique for working examples. The chalkboards suck so he just like writes an equation and says the numbers in broken English. Be prepared to teach Physics to yourself because he definitely won't. Lots of HW (HOURS/wk)."
2378,2370373,1.0,5.0,He basically doesnt speak English and I personally had to use my homework to teach myself the class. By the end my homework grade was bringing me down to a C even though I had an A test average because he failed to educated effectively.
2379,2255688,3.0,5.0,"Li used this subscription based service to count attendance and allowed you to see the PPT from your phone or laptop. Any professor that does this should NOT be worth your time or money. If you must take him, he speaks broken english with is impossible to understand with a mask on and in a lecture hall with 300 students. "
2380,2255688,5.0,2.0,"Professor Li is a very sweet and good teacher.  He gives you a good review before each test to make sure you are prepared.  The class is not difficult as long as you make sure to study.  He can sometimes be hard to understand, but not usually too bad.  There are quizzes usually but it is one simple question and it helps your grade.  "
2381,2255688,4.0,2.0,"It is really hard to understand him in lecture, but if you take good notes you will do just fine. He does a review before each test and it will prepare you well for the tests. He does some quizzes which help keep your grade up too."
2382,2255688,3.0,5.0,Hard to understand
2383,2255688,4.0,3.0,Overall Dr. Li is a solid choice for Biochemistry. He reads off the slides but most of the time he has key concepts highlighted so you know to study them for the exams. He give random pop quizzes so you'll want to attend class. He also rushes at the end when he runs out of time but overall his tests are fair.
2384,2255688,3.0,3.0,"The class was fairly easy and straight forward. In a large lecture hall, Dr. Li was sorta hard to understand, but it wasn't a big deal. Attendance is mandatory as he gives pop quizzes randomly throughout the semester. Tests were also pretty easy."
2385,2255688,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Li started off great, but he responded rude to student's questions and concerns. He would only open the test during a 1 hour time period, knowing that students had to drive back from class at 11 &amp; class started at 11:10. The final was supposed to be over just the final section of the class, but it was the whole semester. Wouldn't recommend"
2386,2255688,4.0,4.0,I love Dr. Li! Best biochemistry teacher ever. His test are definitely from lectures so study! He gives quizzes but they arent hard. He also gives you a review PowerPoint for upcoming test and doesnt give you new material to learn so you wont feel crammed. He does talk a lot tho and kind of rushed when hes running out of time.
2387,1706825,4.0,3.0,"Professor Husain is great! She always has great stories and makes me laugh every single day! The class is interesting and is super easy if you go to class and take (a lot) of notes off the powerpoint. Few tests, which she gives you detailed study guides for! No need to read the text book she basically covers all the material in her powerpoints! "
2388,1706825,5.0,1.0,"Just go to class, listen to her lectures, copy the powerpoints into your notebook. Read the chapters. I made my own chapter outlines for the textbook on my own time, but after the first test (easy) it was not worth it. Plus she gave a really inspirational story (you'll have to find out for yourself) that I really enjoyed. She's awesome. "
2389,1706825,3.5,2.0,"Ms. Husain is a fairly nice teacher and her class is pretty easy. Her class is strictly lecture and note taking. She doesn't allow computers as of this year so notes are handwritten from powerpoint. Also there is a pre/post test every week online from each chapter we cover. That can be very long, boring and time consuming"
2390,1706825,4.0,2.0,"There is a lot of note taking in this class. She lets you use laptops so be sure to bring it because you wont have enough time to write everything down. She moves fairly quickly. Tests aren't bad, she gives study guides for them. Homework is online and requires you to read to chapter if you want to do well."
2391,1706825,2.0,3.0,It is darn near impossible to get an A in this class because of the inconsistency within the homework/tests and the textbook. The notes do little to no good with helping with the homework. The same sort of questions appear on the tests. The subjectivity of the questions are to high to insure success in the class. I got Bs on everything as a result.
2392,1706825,5.0,1.0,"Ms. Jonelle is a wonderful instructor. She is very helpful and makes me laugh every day. If you go to class, you'll have everything you need to study for her tests. She keeps things interesting."
2393,1706825,5.0,1.0,Boring class. Mrs. Husain is a good teacher. Her tests come from textbook and the readings book. She does give a study guide.
2394,1157960,5.0,3.0,I had Dr Neumann for H Calc 3 and I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. Gives lectures in a straight and understandable way and will always answer questions during the lectures. If you have trouble with a Mathematica project he will be very helpful if you visit him during office hours. Gives a lot of partial credit on tests and grades quick
2395,1157960,5.0,5.0,"I had Honors Calc 3 with him and although it was a very difficult class, I would definitely reccomend him as a professor. He gives examples in class similar to what will be on the test and is ALWAYS helpful in office hours (regarding lectures and projects). HW is harder than the examples in class, but he never makes the tests as hard as HW."
2396,1157960,3.0,5.0,"Very hard tests. Very passionate about the class and has a good sense of humor, but also very strict on knowing the material. Great teacher but be prepared to work on your own"
2397,1157960,4.0,4.0,"He has very planned lectures, so they are clear and concise, and his writing and notation are very clear. He answers questions, but don't expect a whole lot of time for it. Overall I think he was a very good professor as long as you listen, take notes, and go over them outside of class."
2398,1157960,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Neumann is incredibly smart.  He is native to Germany and his accent is very thick.  He can sometimes be hard to understand, but he goes over everything pretty well.  I had him for Calc IV and it is not an easy class.  His tests are pretty hard and he assigns Mathematica tests.  He is a really nice guy and will help you outside of class!"
2399,1157960,5.0,3.0,"One of the smartest teachers I have ever had. He knows calculus extremely well. Great teacher and lots of fun. He does a great job of explaining the material. The only draw back are his tests. They are extremely hard, but if you do all the homework and pay attention you will be fine. If you are looking to fully learn Calculus, him at any costs."
2400,1157960,4.5,4.0,"Had him for both Cal 2 and 3, and LOVED him! His class is a little harder than most people would like (you can't use a calculator), but you actually LEARN the material! Would definitely take him again!"
2401,1133387,4.0,3.0,"3.5 difficulty. She assigns book readings but all you need is lectures. Very knowledgable and loves psych. There's a mask project, and you have to read a novel and write a paper. Tests are short answer and short essay, but she grades pretty easily and made the last two much easier than the first after realizing it was too hard. Attendance graded. "
2402,1133387,3.0,3.0,"She is... interesting. Class itself  pretty easy, sitting through lectures felt like a waste of time. Attendance is for a grade, I was always doing homework for other classes. Packback was required to be purchased to participate in a weekly post and respond to 2 for a grade. Had 1 paper, rubric was super vague and was graded harshly."
2403,1133387,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Adams-Price is a wonderful professor. Her lectures are interesting and will keep you entertained. I really enjoyed her class and she absolutely loves her students. She shares lots of stories about her life too. The tests are essay questions so preparing ahead of time is necessary; however, she does give you a study guide."
2404,1133387,4.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed Dr. Adam-price's class. She does care for her students and provides ample study material before exams. The class is not difficult at all if you show up to lecture. However, she can be boring during her lectures. Not always, but definitely a fair amount of the time. I bought the book, but you 100% don't need it."
2405,1133387,2.0,1.0,"Dr. Adams-Price is really nice, but her class can easily be an online class. She basically reads off the Powerpoints. You do not need the textbook because she will create questions based on her Slides. Her lectures are boring."
2406,1133387,5.0,1.0,very nice
2407,273225,2.0,4.0,"I have enjoyed Dr. Sullivan's classes in the past. However, now that she is department head, it feels like she doesn't have empathy for her students. Despite this being ASE student's heaviest semester in university, she continuously gives homework and projects that require an insane amount of time to complete and won't move due dates. AVOID"
2408,273225,5.0,4.0,"You wants to pass this class, DO NOT SKIP CLASS &amp; DO HOMEWORK. Her homework could be little hard, but that prepares you for the upcoming exams."
2409,273225,5.0,2.0,No Comments
2410,273225,5.0,2.0,No Comments
2411,1485652,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Solomon is very hands on and does his best to get students to understand physics. I struggled with the course due to inability to comprehend the subject matter, not because of Dr. Solomon. Participation isn't mandatory but is appreciated by him. Tests are straight from the homework and book problems, it is in your best interest to heavily study"
2412,1485652,1.0,4.0,"Honestly one of the top 3 worst professors Ive taken. Never accessible outside of class, barely answers questions, and his tests are NOTHING like his material, which for one test, made over half the class fail. You will not know what formulas you will be given until you take the test, and he will not give any study guides to help. 100% AVOID!"
2413,1485652,1.0,5.0,"Not very accessible outside of class. Says he will give partial credit on test, but grades very harshly."
2414,1485652,5.0,3.0,"If you can understand the homework, read the textbook, and work the book example problems, you'll be golden. I know it sounds like a lot, but the tests come straight from the homework and the book examples. He brings in props and tries to get the class involved, and he also gives an extra credit problem on the tests. I definitely would take again."
2415,1485652,1.0,4.0,"This class sucked. The professor was barely accessible outside of class and offered little to no help. Despite it being an online class during a pandemic, no lecture recordings were posted to help students. It was almost as if he didnt want us to succeed. Would NOT recommend taking."
2416,1485652,1.0,4.0,"Graded the first test incredibly hard. Everyone I know failed and a ton of people dropped the class. I went to meet with him and he was the most discouraging teacher I've ever met. Basically told me I needed to change my major and made me feel terrible about myself. I stuck with the class, made As on the next two tests, and ended up with a B."
2417,1485652,3.0,4.0,"A lot of people don't like him, but if you pay attention in class and take good notes, you'll be fine. I was in the online section, so our tests were honorlock proctored. We couldn't go back and forth between questions. The final was in person and not extremely difficult, though. He isn't very accessible outside of class, though."
2418,1485652,1.0,5.0,"Does examples wrong in class. Figured out half way through the semester that I had to teach myself. Easily the worst teacher I've taken in college or high school. Doesn't communicate or won't answer any questions about future tests, problems worked in class, or anything in general. Awful teacher."
2419,1485652,4.0,3.0,"For Gen Physics 1 he's probably your best bet. Lectures can be dull but he brings in props from lab to demonstrate ideas and cracks jokes very often which makes it enjoyable. Tests are extremely easy and straight from the easier homework problems. Graded on tests, homework, lab, and final. Will look to take him again in the future."
2420,1485652,2.0,5.0,"This is a teach-yourself class. His accent isn't thick but don't be fooled, as it's still hard to grasp the concept he's trying to teach. Thankfully it's not too hard to learn from the homework since it's from the book. Similar questions show up on the test -however- he is the strictest grader in physics I've ever seen. Formulas given on test days."
2421,1485652,4.0,4.0,"Out of the MSU physics department, I would recommend Solomon. Knows his stuff. Goes straight out of the book. Lectures can be mind-boggling at times, but it's physics 2."
2422,1485652,1.0,5.0,"This is probably the worst teacher Ive ever had. Dont waste your time in lecture because his English is pitiful. If you dont do the tests exactly like he wants and you still get the correct answers, he still counts it off completely. Take physics at a junior college if you can bc MSU physics is pitiful and youd be wasting your time."
2423,1485652,3.0,4.0,Relates flux to having a lady. Pure academic gold
2424,1485652,3.0,4.0,"There are bonus questions on every test, and the final exam has a bonus if you miss less than 2 days of class. KNOW YOUR STUFF. He will mark off for simple mistakes and partial credit is slim."
2425,1485652,4.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Solomon in the summer, and it was honestly a great choice. He's very by-the-book, and we were limited two days for unexcused absences before we automatically failed the class (according to the syllabus). He explained things thoroughly, worked out plenty of problems, and gave homework that was graded for completion which all helped a ton."
2426,1485652,1.0,5.0,Useless professor. Lecture's are pointless and tests are graded with basically NO partial credit. In a physics class. Don't take this class. Take anything else.
2427,1485652,1.0,5.0,Hard grader and you have to learn everything yourself
2428,1485652,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Solomon is pretty straight forward. He's there to teach you physics, you're there to learn physics. His lectures can be boring at times, but he brings in props and things to make it more exciting. Your grade is based on HW, tests, and lab. The class is not difficult if you just pay a little attention. I'm taking him again for physics 2."
2429,1485652,4.0,3.0,"I really respect dr. Solomon and all that he taught me in General Physics 1. He really gave me all the information that I needed in order to move on to the next some General Physics. Although sometimes it says were pretty hard, he was very successful out of class and also he would be able help me out whenever I needed him to help me out."
2430,1485652,3.0,4.0,"Solomon was available for help, but his way of explaining things was not super helpful in or out of class. He follows the book very strictly, so that was very useful l for learning the material. Tests were similar to the homework with one or two curveballs on each test. Class lecture were very boring, but the demonstrations were interesting."
2431,1485652,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Solomon is a good professor, but his teaching style doesn't mesh well with a lot of students. His tests have 3-6 questions on them, so if you miss a question, you automatically drop a letter grade. But, he gives you a practice test that has the same problems on it as the actual test. So, he's not all that hard if you study."
2432,1485652,1.0,4.0,Very difficult to understand. Doesn't really explain things well. Problems worked in class rarely show up on tests. Don't take this guy of you can help it!
2433,1485652,3.5,3.0,"Very strict about attendance, but he teaches straight from the book. Tests were a combination of conceptual questions and quantitative problems. Overall, not a bad teacher, just pretty boring."
2434,1485652,1.0,4.0,"I hated this class. We only had like 3 tests, and if you get a problem wrong, your grade is down to a C already. He is very bad with partial credit. The high point of this class was when I went into his office and proved him wrong on a test question. He was twitching in anger :)"
2435,1485652,2.0,3.0,"He can be very hard to understand at times because of his accent. He has a humorous side and uses lots of demonstrations, but lectures are usually long and boring. Tests are decent; work extra problems and study, and you should do fine. He is very strict about attendance. Overall just an okay class."
2436,1485652,2.0,5.0,"Physics under SolomonNOT EASY. During office hours, I felt like that he thought I was a bad student even tho I study religiously. Lectures are clear, but the 4 tests are awful because no multiple choice. But Non-comprehensive final. Physics tutors are on campus, but I got confused by them too. Save yourself, take this course at a junior college."
2437,1485652,5.0,4.0,"Dr Solomon is a great teacher. He is there for his students if they have any problems with homework or other stuff. He truely wants his students to succeed and do well in physics. Tests are kinda hard but it is physics so you shouldn't expect an easy class. If you work extra problems outside of class, you will do better on the tests."
2438,1485652,3.5,2.0,"Very good teacher. Language was a little bit of an issue, but not very bad compared to other teachers. Fair tests, fair homework, willing to work with you. Definitely suggest him. Brings a laugh to class as well."
2439,1485652,1.0,4.0,"I did very well in Winter's physics 1, but Solomon is literally the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire educational career. I cannot understand anything he says. I remember some topics from Chemistry, and he taught them completely wrong. AVOID HIM LIKE THE PLAGUE."
2440,1485652,1.5,4.0,Very hard to understand and his lectures are not helpful. You will have to teach yourself
2441,1485652,4.5,1.0,I absolutely loved Solomon's class. I was worried at first because everyone talks about how hard physics is. (And I took it in the summer.) But he really did a great job at explaining everything. His test were fair. And most questions on the tests were straight from the homework questions. He is goofy at times and makes jokes in class. TAKE HIM!!
2442,1485652,2.0,4.0,"Major language barrier. Grades fairly. Is willing to work with you if you're willing to put in the effort. I never got anything out of his lectures, I had to teach myself."
2443,2206568,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fuhrmann is the best. I've had him for multiple classes and I always enjoyed them. If you can, take his class. Test are made from notes so if you study you should be fine. He really cares. His lectures can get boring but you will still learn."
2444,2206568,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Fuhrmann is a fantastic professor!! I had him for Applied Climatology, Physical Climatology and Climate Change, and he was a great and inspiring professor in all three. He's passionate about the subjects and cares about the students. All his tests are from the notes, so studying the notes definitely helps! Would HIGHLY recommend him!!"
2445,2206568,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Fuhrmann is one of the straightforward teachers I've ever had. He presents and explains his lectures very well each day in class, and also posts them online. Even the labs in Applied Clim aren't too bad. His tests are very easy if you study straight from the study guide. Would definitely recommend."
2446,2206568,4.0,3.0,Dr. Fuhrumann is just himself. I like him. Labs in Applied Clim are kind of hard and long though. Tests arent bad.
2447,2206568,4.0,3.0,"I'm not so sure about the other review on here, Dr. Fuhrmann is awesome Yes, his tests are tough, but he's noticed that and started to change to make it easier to study for. He gives out study guides for every test, final exam questions come directly from old tests. Projects count more than tests, thank god. He is a great professor, love him"
2448,2206568,2.0,4.0,Tests are hard but most of the grade comes from projects. He will post the lectures but will add in different information during the lecture that you will miss if you do not attend.
2449,846697,5.0,5.0,Brilliant man and professor. I hope he will be a long-term mentor for me.
2450,846697,2.0,3.0,He does not answer your specific questions and tests are made from small sentences in the book.
2451,846697,5.0,1.0,"If you are looking for an easy class, look no further. Dr. Templeton is an &quot;old school&quot; lecturer. All you have to do for an easy A is look over the vocabulary terms before class, and then answer his bonus questions before class begins. He gives up to 5 points on an exam score per correct answer. He is fairly cool too."
2452,846697,4.0,2.0,"Be sure to put in the work for the Intellectual Capitalism Case papers. Easy tests, Gives great feedback."
2453,846697,2.0,3.0,Most. Boring. Lectures. Ever... just read the book. The only reason to go to class is for the bonus points.
2454,846697,4.0,2.0,"Learn the terms at the end of each chapter before going to class each day to get bonus points. He gives them out SO MUCH. He takes attendance for the first half of the semester then stops. He's a nice, good looking man that is VERY involved in new technology & he shares new inventions and what nots with the class via email. "
2455,846697,2.0,4.0,"He talks too much about nothing. His slides are not put online, but are only bullet-ed in class. So in other words, vague. The has a theory lecture that is mandatory to attend, right before the test."
2456,846697,5.0,3.0,"One of the coolest teachers on campus... I appreciated how he kept us students ""in the loop"" by emailing us news articles, uni. updates, etc... He is highly approachable. I do not see how anyone could have a problem with him. Definitely take him."
2457,846697,5.0,1.0,Greatest professor ever. He hands out bonus points like candy. I received so many bonus points I didn't have to take the final. You will really enjoy his class and get an easy A as well
2458,846697,4.0,2.0,"Gary's class is very boring. I've had him for two classes, and both were horribly uninteresting. He gives plenty of bonus points to people for answering questions and towards the end of the semester attendance is not mandatory. I would suggest going though because that's when the most points are given."
2459,846697,4.5,1.0,"Had him for MIS during Maymester, easiest class I have ever taken. easy to understand and lots of bonus points. as long as you go to class you will be good to go"
2460,846697,5.0,1.0,Management Information Systems. It's a super easy class. Just be sure to go to class - he gives out TONS of bonus points. His class can be very boring though. Attendance is only mandatory for the first half of the semester. The main thing you'll have to do in this class is memorize definitions. That's the bulk of his tests.
2461,846697,3.5,3.0,He is a good teacher
2462,846697,2.5,3.0,"He's a definite nerd, but tries hard (to no avail mostly) to make the class interesting. Attendance counts for lab & class. Tests are fool-proof if you practice the tasks beforehand. Really stinks that its only offered at night though."
2463,846697,4.0,2.0,"This class is overall extremely boring, but he uses a format that is easy to follow and make good grades with.  The tests are taken exactly from the book, and some of the videos we watch in class are interesting."
2464,846697,3.0,3.0,No Comments
2465,846697,5.0,1.0,"I took it in the summer and his policy was that if you did your homework before classtime, you didnt have to come to class.  That was fun, and the homework is fail proof.  Tests are easy to pass, and he is very understanding about issues with the software.  His class is totally based on this awesome software, so do the easy work and you'll get an A"
2466,846697,3.5,2.0,"The lab for this class is the only thing that you are required to attend.  From the couple of times that I actually went to the class, he didn't seem to know how to do certain things.  The lab is fairly easy if you know how to work a computer and the tests come straight from the book."
2467,846702,1.0,2.0,   
2468,846702,4.0,3.0,Good class
2469,846702,5.0,1.0,Mrs. Leonard is AMAZING. she is so sweet and gracious and always willing to explain things. She always emails you reminding you of assignments due which is super helpful. she's super passionate about what she's talking about and very good at explaining her in detail. wish i could take her for every class. she is so nice and funny
2470,846702,5.0,3.0,"This class can be really easy if you do your work. She assigns a lot of writing responses, but if you put effort in, your grade will be good. Mrs. Leonard is really nice and she cares so much about her students and the subject. If you finish your rough draft before you turn it in, she'll write down everything you need to change to do well."
2471,846702,2.5,4.0,"Really liked her as a person. Passionate about subject! Read important and interesting literature. She assigns a prompt aka 2 page paper assignment due for almost every class. TOUGH TOUGH TOUGH grader on papers. Had to work extremely hard. Unless writing/English is very, very easy and enjoyable for you, I would definitely not recommend her class."
2472,846702,2.5,4.0,She's an okay professor but I would not personally take her class again.
2473,846702,4.5,4.0,"She is an awesome teacher. She is very helpful when you come for questions, and helps as much as possible for ideas for papers. The papers are graded hard, but she counts off for not analyzing as much as you can. So be sure to be as specific as you can be"
2474,846702,2.5,3.0,"Into to lit. Discussion was interesting when her comments made sense... No extra credit, grades rather hard on papers with no rubric for explanation... The entire test is discussion or fill in the blank... Lecture isnt very effective... Interesting material was read, though"
2475,846702,2.5,4.0,"She's a nice lady and understands what she's teaching but grades really hard and expects you to know what she wants out of a paper. Tries to explain, but rarely makes sense. The lecture doesn't help at all with writing the paper"
2476,846702,4.5,4.0,great teacher in my opinion.. always willing to help.. does grade tough but is very helpful in improving.. very nice and patient..
2477,846702,5.0,2.0,She is so sweet and has a lot of patience with everyone in the class.
2478,846702,4.0,3.0,"She is really nice and tries to explain and help others understand, she does grade a little harder than other teachers, but it will help you in the long run.  If you miss class, you may miss quizzes or trips to library which might hurt your grade."
2479,846702,3.0,3.0,"I absolutely hate English and Mrs. Leonard didn't make it any better for me.  She grades really hard on your essays and doesn't really help you at all.  She may seem nice, but don't let that fool you."
2480,846711,4.0,3.0,Best math teacher I've ever had. She will continuously go over material until everyone in the class understands. Would 100% take again. 
2481,846711,5.0,1.0,I like her teaching methods
2482,846711,3.5,2.0,"She does anything she can to help you out.  Her test reviews are exactly like the tests.  The only negative thing about this class was the &quot;My Math Lab&quot;.  The quizzes that we had to take in the Math Domain were nothing like what we went over in class and they don't help your grade out at all.  Overall, I would recommend this teacher to anyone."
2483,1723257,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Poe is good. His lectures are fine, but don't expect to get out of this class early. His lab is required and if you miss more than once then you automatically have to take the final, which is very difficult. Honestly, your grade depends on your lab instructor since they'll be grading all your news reports. Class attendance is required I'd say. "
2484,1723257,3.0,1.0,"Dr. Poe was alright. He tries to make the class relatable. He just didnt click with me as a professor. I would take him again, but I wouldnt say he is the best teacher I have had at MSU."
2485,1723257,5.0,4.0,Dr. Poe is literally one of the best professors I've ever had. He is tough but funny and engaging. There is a lot of work but he gives you plenty of time to do it. Make sure you go to labs so you don't have to take the final exam. It gets easier as the year goes on too. I made sure I got into another one of his classes next semester too!
2486,1723257,5.0,4.0,I had Dr. Poe for intro to news writing and reporting and the only bad thing I can say about it is I wish it was in person to get to know him more. He knows his stuff so don't think you'll be able to get by with mediocre work. News and AP quizzes will affect your grade a lot so be sure to get good grades on those. News stories count the most though
2487,1723257,5.0,2.0,I love him!!!!! I always emailed him because the class was online and he responded back in a timely manner and didnt have an attitude!!! His class is easy but it is a lot of group work but I dont feel like he grades hard at all! I loved him and would take him for any other class!!
2488,1723257,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Poe is a great teacher. Many times nowadays you have teachers that aren't the biggest experts at their fields. Dr. Poe is VERY knowledgeable and he tailors his lectures to inform students on how they can improve on the news stories they are writing. Aside from being a great teacher, he is a funny guy that engages with the class."
2489,1723257,5.0,1.0,He is a funny and awesome teacher. I wish he could teach all my classes!
2490,1723257,5.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. Poe!! For the love of all things green on this earth, go to lab. You get one skip and you really do not need to use it. His lectures get a little lengthy sometimes but hes such a nice guy and has an excellent beard. Hes willing to work and answer all questions. Go to class for pop quizzes almost every week!"
2491,1723257,5.0,2.0,"I've taken Poe for three classes at MSU. Intro to News Writing, Beginning TV, and Feature Writing. (That should something right there.) He's a great teacher. You'll want to go to class."
2492,1723257,5.0,2.0,"I loved Dr. Poe. He has this abrasive sense of humor, that I just found very entertaining. He is very to the point, but he's also really fair. He speaks to you like an adult which I admired. You definitely have to do your work, but he rewards you with fair grading and opportunities to correct it. Very good teacher, this class is definitely usefull"
2493,1723257,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Poe is AMAZING!! It speaks volumes that he doesn't take attendance, and 90% of the class still shows up every day. The man is hilarious. "
2494,1723257,5.0,4.0,"I walked in  15 minutes late with leftover Shipley's. He stopped class, walked to my seat and told me he would not count me absent if I gave him a donut. He gets student's feedback and adjusts his teaching style to fit the class.  His beard is perfect! I am amazed and jealous."
2495,1723257,5.0,3.0,"Poe is the best professor I have ever had. He is interesting, entertaining, and teaches material that will be useful in the comm. field. He is also FINE. Seriously, take the class, you won't regret it."
2496,1723257,5.0,2.0,He is very helpful to any student and is super funny during class. He will get to talking about things sometimes and waste class time.  He shows the funniest youtube videos also.
2497,1723257,5.0,2.0,"Poe was a great teacher. He was super helpful, and he loves journalism. So that made the class easier to get through. He was always willing to answer any question and he wants to help in any way he can. You definitely need the books that he requires, you can't pass without them. He's one of my favorite teachers that I've had here at State."
2498,1723257,5.0,1.0,"Super easy for intro to newswriting. There are no tests! You only have to write articles, and there is plenty of time to do this during the lab. Don't buy the green media book! But you will need the AP stylebook."
2499,1723257,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful! Makes everything clear and easy. If you have less than two abscences at the end of the year, you automatically receive a 110 on the final. Great incentive. Lecture was helpful and entertaining. Most I've learned in a class so far at state."
2500,1313688,5.0,5.0,This man can TALK some Heidegger and Sartre! Outstanding.
2501,1313688,5.0,4.0,No Comments
2502,1313688,4.0,2.0,"Had him for Logic. Enthusiastic, looks like harry potter. He's patient with you and his tests aren't that hard if you pay attention OR study. No real need for both."
2503,2485157,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Nannapaneni is a great guy and probably a remarkable microbiologist, but his class is so DRY. He basically reads off the slides for lectures and labs are so slow. 1.5 hour lab for 10 minutes of work. Easy class though, just be prepared to be bored to death."
2504,1747878,1.5,5.0,"HORRIBLE class, but MSU has a terrible science department as a whole and he is the lesser of evils. His notes are quite an overload and he does not post them so bring your laptop to class and be prepared to type your fingers off. Test are insanely detailed. May the odds be in your favor."
2505,1747878,2.0,5.0,"Terrible teacher, but MSU doesn't have good science teachers."
2506,1747878,3.5,4.0,"Mr. Doffitt's class is not easy, but he is more than willing to help.  People who say he is not helpful must not have asked.  He will go over things with you outside of class if you don't understand. He went over topics with me repeatedly and never acted grumpy. Got a B in the class but had to study!  Gives extra points for quizzes and attendance."
2507,1747878,1.5,4.0,"Terrible teacher. Reads off the power point all class, but doesn't believe in posting them online. So all class you have to scribble down what he's saying and try to make sense of it later. Tests are the tiniest details you wouldn't think are important. Avoid him at all costs."
2508,1747878,2.5,4.0,NOT a helpful teacher does however give you extra credit for attendance.. But if you are .2 points from receiving a higher grade he will not help you!
2509,1747878,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Doffitt is an excellent example of a stellar professor. Must study but I find that if one studies while patting head and rubbing belly, then the information is easier to absorb. Also, if you do the rain dance before a test you are likely to get an A. Its all about the earth!"
2510,1747878,2.0,5.0,Be sure to go to class and take good notes! You have to study in advance for all of his test to even make a decent grade. Also His notes come straight from the book.
2511,1747878,3.5,5.0,"He covers a lot of information really fast, you need to study like 12 hours to get anywhere near a B on his tests. Its pretty difficult, but not impossible"
2512,2476978,5.0,2.0,Dr. Stafford is a great professor! He gives background information on every subject covered which helps with making the class interesting yet informative. History of Psychology is one of the very few classes he teaches because he also has another job. I wish there were more I could take with him. His tests are his Powerpoints and the notes you take
2513,2304964,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Brown is one of my favorite professors at MSU! I took this class as a science elective, and it was great. She truly cares about every one of her students, and wants the best for you. Her lectures and review videos are great, not to mention all the extra credit! She's ""not your mama, but she's somebody's mama"", and it shows. She's amazing!"
2514,2304964,5.0,2.0,"I took her for interpersonal relations and she is my favorite professor. There are 4 exams, a study guide is provided for each. Extra credit is offered before each exam, and the final exam is optional. The only grades for the class are in-class activities, exams, and extra credit. Just attend class, do the extra credit, and study and you'll be fine"
2515,2304964,5.0,3.0,"Professor Brown is awesome!!! She is incredibly knowledgeable about the subjects she teaches and is very clear in her instruction; in-class assignments that are entirely opinion-based and four tests make up most of your grade, and she gives extra credit opps each unit. She's super understanding if something is going on and is willing to help!"
2516,2304964,5.0,3.0,Kimberly is the best teacher Ive ever had period. She is so good at engaging the class and making it fun. She delivers the information very well so that its very easy to understand. She is very understanding that her students are people that go though hard things and will help you however she can. Psych of interpersonal relationships is the best.
2517,2304964,5.0,2.0,"She is an easy class with very interesting and easy to understand criteria. She gives you the slides and you fill in the blanks for notes. Tests are administrated online. She takes attendance through random mid-lecture simple questions you answer, often your own opinion. But, those are graded, we had 12 this semester."
2518,2304964,5.0,3.0,"Professor Brown is one of the best teachers in the Psych department. Took her for Biological and Interpersonal Relations, and she was great for both. She rounded my 88% to an A for one of those classes without me asking. Biological is one of the hardest classes, but she teaches it well and makes it easy to understand."
2519,2304964,5.0,3.0,"Enjoyable lecture, good personality, and test relate directly to the lecture. Had her for bio psych and really enjoyed the class."
2520,2304964,5.0,3.0,"I love her. she is a mom, so she cares for you like a young mom. her mantra was &quot;don't do drugs,&quot; but it was always funny and not annoying. she wants everyone to succeed and always gives about 6ish points on everyones' tests. 10/10"
2521,2304964,5.0,2.0,"Biological psychology is notoriously known as the most difficult class in the psychology curriculum. However, she made it super easy to understand and interactive with participation points."
2522,2304964,5.0,3.0,"She is the most professional and caring professor I have had at MSU. She knows her stuff and keeps your attention. She posts fill in the blank slides, so you HAVE to come to class to get notes, and she has several easy activities for participation credit, which just requires you to write down your opinion on certain topics. Learned SO MUCH!!"
2523,2304964,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful, wonderful, WONDERFUL professor. She makes the class so interesting and she herself isnt boring in any way. She teaches the material so well. She has a passion for her job and she doesnt read off the slides. Attendence is not taken but go because she doesnt post the full notes online, just the blanks."
2524,2304964,4.0,3.0,"PowerPoints are fill in the blank, the material is pretty easy but she doesnt post full slides online so you need to go to class to get the full notes."
2525,2304964,5.0,1.0,"LOVE Master Brown!! This is the 2nd class I've taken with her and have made A's in both. Her lectures are anything but boring and you can tell she loves what she does. Notes are from PPT fill in the blank slides you print before class, online exams, optional final. I really hope to take another class with her."
2526,2304964,5.0,1.0,the tests are online and word for word from the notes she gives in class. gives a lot of opportunity for extra credit. I did well on the first four tests so the final was optional! she's very nice and very accessible outside of class.
2527,2419672,1.0,5.0,"I am no advisor but I would highly advise you to stay away from this class. She is extremely difficult to understand and does not know how to teach well. The Lab TAs were rude and awful as well.This was the most miserable, stressful, and difficult class I have taken at MSU. Either get a tutor or drop the class! "
2528,2419672,2.0,4.0,"The only reason I made an A in the class is that I had a great high school chem class. She is SO confusing to listen to and tries to explain every problem in-depth but it just makes it more confusing and wastes the whole class time on one problem. She is very nice and if you ask her for help, she will do everything she can to help you."
2529,2419672,5.0,4.0,She really cares about you and is effective teacher. Very clear and helpful lectures. Makes a difficult class a lot easier. Love her.
2530,2419672,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher, very knowledgeable . The class is heavy with lots of materials but if you study hard you will get good grades. Very accesible outside class."
2531,2419672,1.0,5.0,This was the most ridiculous course I have ever taken. I never know what is going on and i have never been so confused in my life. There is too much material to cover for it to be on one test and it is not even taught well in class. Would not recommend.
2532,2419672,1.0,4.0,Absolutely awful. Having to sit in on another class in order to pass. Difficult to understand and makes the material way more complicated than what it already is. Honestly youre better off dropping the course if you cant switch professors. Good luck to anyone who has her - made my semester absolutely miserable
2533,2419672,1.0,3.0,Very hard to understand. Is very ineffective at lecturing. She made everything more confusing than it needed to be. I ended up having to teach myself the course. Do not take this professor if at all possible!!!
2534,2419672,1.0,5.0,"Hard to understand , and doesnt explain problems well. She expects you to already know everything. Also makes a lot of mistakes."
2535,2419672,4.0,4.0,"Difficult course but very accesible professor. Good lectures if you read ahead and ask questions. The problem is that she spends so much time trying to make us think for ourselves but then we have to memorize a lot of stuff for the tests. Accessible outside class, will do everything to help . Gives extra credit and drops your lowest grade"
2536,2419672,5.0,5.0,This is an extremely difficult class with lots of materials but Dr. Monteil tried her best to help us. She was always available for office hours and she&acute;s very good at explaining over and over. I had a family situation and she was very understanding. Be prepared to work very hard but she&acute;s very helpful and passionate. Best if she wrote her own test
2537,2419672,1.0,5.0,"She seems nice, but would never take this class again. I go to a tutor who teaches me instead of her class and still somehow get low grades on the tests. I have tried to see her multiple times to get the tests back and she makes it almost impossible to see her. Sounds strange to me. I am an A/B student and am hovering a few points below a C rn."
2538,2419672,1.0,5.0,"Doctor Montiel makes chemistry extremely difficult. She does not go over the material well in class, and I never felt prepared for the tests .Chemistry is already a difficult subject, and she makes it even more difficult. If you have to take chemistry at MSU take anyone else but her."
2539,2419672,1.0,4.0,"Lags way behind the lab and lecture, even when the schedule gets adjusted, wastes half of class calling people up to the board to do overly complex problems, read directly from the slides (and still manages to get things wrong) and you won't ever know what the recitation sheets have. Absolute last resort professor. Never again."
2540,2419672,1.0,4.0,"Drones on and on in class, and is extremely boring. It's very hard to stay awake during her lecture because she reads directly off the slides. The slides are online but don't help much because recitation is much more complicated than the material she teaches in class. Do. Not. Take."
2541,2419672,1.0,5.0,"she goes on and o during the lectures, she makes the lectures extremely borning. she makes the tests/recitation/labs hard because she does do a good job explaining the material. and she also has a thick accent that is very hard to understand at times. she doesnt allow laptops nor phones in the lectures and wants you to print out every slide od lecs"
2542,2616298,2.0,3.0,Does not give relevant feedback in a writing heavy class. Often you will find yourself wondering why anything you are doing is relevant to the tasks at hand or why you must write two pages of material to answer something that could be answered in a sentence. 
2543,1731562,4.0,2.0,His lectures are very boring but you don't have to go to one class a week because it's just a time to do the homework in the lab which you can do at home.  The tests are pretty easy but you do need to study for them!
2544,2518015,3.0,4.0,"He has a very monotone voice, so it's hard to pay attention. The tests were very difficult for me, but I somehow made it out with a B."
2545,2518015,2.0,3.0,"He has a very boring, monotone voice which makes it difficult to pay attentional to the already boring information that he is teaching. There is a decent amount of homework but you can easily get a perfect score without doing it all. Homework is all combined to count as more than a test grade. Tests are course-wide and not made by professor."
2546,2518015,2.0,4.0,Accounting is an awful subject overall to learn but he doesn't make it any easier. This class is difficult for a lot of people and yet he doesn't even provide a study guide.
2547,2518015,2.0,4.0,"Seems like a nice guy but this was the most boring class I've ever taken. He speaks so quietly, is always late, and is the least engaging person ever. I haven't learned a single thing from him. He also does not respond to my emails. Again, he seems like a nice guy, but he is so dull and makes this class harder than it should be."
2548,2518015,1.0,5.0,The accounting department was one of the departments that went fully online for the 2020 fall semester and he didnt teach a single thing. Just uploaded powerpoints and vague videos of concepts. And he locked our grades after the first week so I didnt know my actual average until the last day of the semester. All around bad Professor.
2549,2518015,3.0,4.0,"He was a nice guy, average teacher. Lectures were super boring and not engaging. Graded only on tests and homework. Didn't give a review or study guide. Homework took a while to get through. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on material. He responded to emails timely and curved a little bit on exams."
2550,2518015,3.0,4.0,"It was tax, so there isn't really a way to make it that interesting, so I give him props that I never noticed anyone actually falling asleep, though it was hard at times. Get your sleep in before class. Study for the tests. The cheat sheet and study guide are not comprehensive of the test."
2551,2518026,4.0,3.0,"You can tell hes very passionate and loves what hes teaching. Hes a pretty easy grader, Ive ended up with a much better grade than I probably deserved. Tests are not bad at all. Would recommend."
2552,2518026,1.0,5.0,"All he does is ramble about irrelevant information, but when he does get around to the important stuff hes extremely difficult to comprehend. If you miss one day of class your entire project drops a letter grade. Although he gives grading rubrics, its clear that if he doesnt like you as a student, your grade will suffer. worst. ever."
2553,2518026,1.0,4.0,"Professor McLemore is the most useless architecture professor Ive had. He picks and chooses which three students will receive As for the semester. Everyone else, prepare to not have a clue how to improve your project. Also, dont expect him to answer emails or show up to scheduled meetings."
2554,2518026,1.0,4.0,"His lectures are TERRIBLE he goes through important material far too fast, and repeatedly skips over very important information. He also wont answer questions outside of class, and it appears he is not very knowledgeable on the subject matter."
2555,2477098,3.0,5.0,She is nice but a very tough grader ! you have to put in extra work for a B in this class
2556,2477098,5.0,3.0,"Shes great! This class is so easy online. Three speeches and 2 test. Shes really nice, take her!"
2557,2477098,4.0,4.0,"She uploads the powerpoints before class. I would recommend writing them down before so when you are in class you can take notes on what she says about each slide. The tests go more in depth than what is just on the slides. There are 3 speeches, and the criteria for each is really relaxed besides the presentation part."
2558,2477098,2.0,4.0,"Ridiculous grader for a freshman level course. if you want an easy A for communication, do not take her"
2559,2477098,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Veluscek is a really wonderful professor! She is really willing to work with you as long as you put some effort in. You will have to give 3 speeches in this class, so be prepared for that. The textbook isn't entirely necessary; I've only used it briefly to study for the first of her two exams and help write a reflection paper. Would recommend!"
2560,2632754,5.0,1.0,Best teacher. easy class. Didnt take attendance. Test online.
2561,2632754,5.0,3.0,"While we were a little heavy on lectures and did them every class, she was super nice and extremely kind and caring, and was real lenient on attendance and didnt care if people didnt show up"
2562,2632754,5.0,4.0,I saw she had a really low rating and had to give her a better one bc she is so amazing. Shes so passionate about this and loves answering weird psychology questions so it makes for really interesting lectures. She is also one of the sweetest professors Ive had and shes super accessible outside of class
2563,2632754,2.0,4.0,"It was pretty much pointless to listen to her lectures. She tests straight from the book, and only mentions half of what you need in her lectures. Seems passionate about her subject."
2564,2075707,4.0,3.0,Can't complain with this guy.  He was fair and a decent lecturer.  It was not difficult to get an A if you applied yourself.
2565,2075710,5.0,3.0,"Had him online for a summer class. Excellent doesn't begin to describe how great he was. So long as you put forth the effort on the homework, then you were pretty much guaranteed an A on the tests. Only reason I made a B is because I didn't put effort into the first homework and it showed. After that I made an A or B+ on every test."
2566,2075710,1.0,5.0,Terrible Professor. He doesn't work any examples. Posts all notes online but they won't help because they look like a 3 year old wrote a bunch of random words. If at all possible take his courses at a different university or with a different professor.
2567,2075710,1.0,4.0,"Pearson is the worst professor I have ever taken. His lectures are unorganized and unclear, he doesn't work examples, he tests on material he hasn't covered at all, he is inaccessible, and his graders are extremely harsh. If you go to study sessions and try to teach yourself you should be ok but its almost impossible to make an A."
2568,2075710,5.0,4.0,Pearson is one of the best teachers that MSU ChemE has. He worked in industry so he knows the practical application of what he teaches. He will make you work your butt off for that grade. Pearson gives the grade at the end of the semester according to how you consistently did in the class. Go to his office for help. He explains well one-on-one.
2569,2075712,4.0,4.0,"The material is hard and he moves quickly, but will go back over something if you ask. Most of the lectures are him deriving equations which gets everyone confused, but you dont have to know how to derive only use the equations. Tests are no harder than homework and he goes over examples thoroughly. Overall really great professor"
2570,2075712,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Kundu is genuinely the most fair and kind professor I have had. He is a little all over the place at times when lecturing, but goes over the test material well and truly wants everyone to understand. Fluids isn't easy, but he helps students in whatever way he can to master the material. Participate in class and you will do well."
2571,2075712,1.0,5.0,The worst teacher Ive ever had. The material is so hard and he flys so quickly through it Hes not nice or caring at all. I have nightmares about his voice.
2572,2075712,2.0,3.0,"He is very hard to understand and his teaching style is all over the place. Homework is graded very harshly. Good thing is quizzes and tests are graded very leniently and are the largest percentage of your grade. Teaches straight from the book, however quizzes and tests did not always reflect what is in the book."
2573,1756228,5.0,2.0,She is clear. She doesn't take attendance but gives random quizzes. 7 homework online. Her exams are fair.
2574,1756228,5.0,2.0,"Very clear and makes the material easy to learn. Doesn't require attendance, but it'd be smart to at least read the book if you don't go to class."
2575,1559647,4.5,2.0,I loved Mr. Dugar's class. He is hilarious and always opens class with a joke or funny picture and he keeps the class interesting the entire time. He make a lot of real world marketing experience and has great stories to help us relate to the topic.
2576,2641017,5.0,3.0,"Awesome instructor, would go above and beyond to help you. Would definitely recommend."
2577,2706554,5.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. T. This class was average in regards to level of difficulty, with lots of reading and writing, but Dr. T gave clear instructions and always gave you great feedback on EVERY assignment so you knew exactly what to correct/improve on for next time. She really cares about you and wants you to do well. I will gladly take any class she offers"
2578,2550910,5.0,2.0,The class had homework at least 2-3 times a week as well as quizzes and 4 tests but were not hard if you went to class. He explained everything thoroughly and did example problems but often got off-topic for 15 minutes. He was extremely personable and genuinely cared about his students and even learned everyone's names. Would take again.
2579,2550910,5.0,1.0,BEST MAN ALIVE!! so funny and caring and REALLY wants his students to succeed. Will do anything outside of class to help you make an A and explains everything so thoroughly. take him if you can!!!
2580,2550910,1.0,3.0,"Mr. Jones is a great teacher when he actually teaches. However, many times he misuses class time talking about his political goals, and other inappopriate topics. He does not have any standards for the classroom and cannot control it. The discussions he starts can be very awkward and unprofessional. Highly recommend you find a different teacher."
2581,1764478,2.0,4.0,"She does give you lots of homework. Hard class to pass if you do not do the study guide and readings she provides you with for homework. In class, she will hint at things you need to memorize. All of your notes have to be handwritten as there are no laptops allowed. You will also need bluebooks. Also, memorize your section number."
2582,1764478,2.0,5.0,So hard. Had so much hard homework every week. We had to read and write a lot for it & it was graded harshly. The tests were horrible. They were all write out/essay questions and they were also graded harshly. There were no opportunities for extra credit even if you tried hard and did all of your work well. I would not take this class again. 
2583,1764478,5.0,4.0,"This semester was very flexible, due to Covid, on physical attendance and recorded her lectures up until Oct. The tests were tough, but she gives a study guide that if you take the time to do and had listened to her lectures and wrote everything on the slide (which she gives you time to do and will pause longer or go back if asked) you will be fine"
2584,1764478,2.0,5.0,she is very hard
2585,1764478,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Ridner was an amazing professor, she spends a lot of time giving feedback on papers to help students improve because she cares about our success. Her lectures are informative and easy to understand, and if you take good notes and study her tests are easy. It is what you would expect for an upper level history class,plenty of reading and writing"
2586,1764478,1.0,5.0,AWFUL. DO NOT TAKE. This was probably the worst professor I have ever had. Not only was she bad the test were worst. The test were all essay questions in Bluebooks so if you do bad on one test.. well good luck for the rest of the year. I do not recommend her.
2587,1764478,1.0,5.0,Mrs. Ridner is yet the hardest Ive taken ! There is so much reading to this class and all of the exams are taken in Bluebooks. There is so much you have to remember and write about in order to pass the exam. This class requires more writing than English ! I definitely recommend not taking this class.
2588,1764478,1.0,4.0,All the tests were OPEN ENDED for the entire exams and closed notes. How are we supposed to memorize over 100+ years of history at a time?!
2589,1764478,3.0,4.0,"A great teacher, but if you miss one class you will struggle. Lots of information in every lecture, but she doesn't mind if you ask her questions at the end of lecture."
2590,1764478,2.0,5.0,"This is hand's down the hardest class I have ever taken. Dr. Ridner LOVES history, but she makes this class WAYYYY to hard for anyone who isn't a history major. ALL tests are long and written in bluebooks. Do not take Ridner. I had a major surgery the semester I took this class along with other health issues and I was told &quot;too bad.&quot; Horrible"
2591,1764478,2.0,5.0,"I would not recommend Ridner to ANYONE! She graded incredibly hard for undergrad. I took her the same time as historiography and was graded harder in her class than historiography.  Reading can be a lot, but that comes with upper level history. She was very boring and relied on the class to lead the entire class. Also big on group projects."
2592,1764478,4.0,5.0,"Ridner is an amazing professor, if you are a history major or really enjoy history. Beware if only taking the class as a basic, the lectures are very thorough, at times too much. Exams are lengthy and will find yourself swamped in material to study. However, you can tell she is very passionate about what she teaches and teaches the material well."
2593,1764478,1.0,4.0,"Lectures get so boring, make friends with the people you sit beside. Attendance isn't &quot;mandatory&quot; but go, or you'll struggle. Learn the key terms! The tests are open-ended, blue book tests, so study your notes! You will get luck of the draw when it comes to who grades your stuff because it's all TAs. I was lucky to have a good one..."
2594,1764478,1.0,5.0,"Study guides consist of anywhere from 20-40 key terms, of which only 3 will be on the test. Most of the information she gives on these is very vague, so you're kinda on your own come test time. Also on the test you write one essay from 2 possible prompts, but there's 3 prompts on the study guide. A lot of extra stuff thrown at you for no reason."
2595,1764478,2.0,4.0,"Tests are 3 short answer questions, all of which require at least a paragraph answer, and then 1 essay, of at least 3 paragraphs. Short answer questions are chosen by her from a list of up to 25 topics. Essay prompt is chosen by her from up to 4 possibilities. So you really have to know the material to do well."
2596,1764478,3.0,5.0,"Run........ (You have to read a solid book every week and write on it) ""Don't do it"" Save yourself."
2597,1764478,4.0,3.0,Two of the days are lecture days and the other day is discussion section. Show up for class and take notes. The notes will help you pass the multiple choice part of the exam. Go to discussion section and make sure you do your homework! It's worth 20% of your grade. The hardest part of the class are the essay exams but she gives you a study guide.
2598,1764478,3.5,3.0,"I have never needed help from Ridner, but I'm sure that upon asking she would be happy to give it. She is super clear with her lectures and they are only 50 minutes long for two days a week. The only bad part is the amount of reading that she assigns for homework. Sometimes the readings can be hard to interpret or can be a lot. "
2599,1764478,3.0,4.0,HI 1063 is one of the essay history courses. You will be required to pay the $40 reader fee. This is where your homework comes from. You can expect to read anywhere from 10-45 pages a week and answer follow up questions. You will have discussion class once a week where you will answer these questions. MAKE SURE TO GET A GOOD T.A.!! 
2600,1764478,4.5,4.0,"She is tough in historiography classes but she is good at trying to make the student understand the content and gain research skills for history students.  If the student is willing to put the effort into it, she is more than willing to help. "
2601,1764478,3.0,2.0,"She's pretty interesting to listen to, but it's history, so it's still pretty boring. Anytime you have a problem you'll be dealing with a TA, not her.  Her tests are completely essay, and while not INCREDIBLY difficult, there's only three all year so screw up on one and you're done.  As long as you go to class and take notes you'll be fine."
2602,1084544,3.5,2.0,"This guy is loud, sings, dances, and demands participation. If he talks a lot about something you need to know it and it will probably be an essay question. The test aren't the easiest but he does work with you."
2603,1084544,3.5,2.0,"Love this guy. He definitely holds your attention. His tests aren't the easiest I've ever taken, but he gives a lot of other easy grades."
2604,1084544,4.0,2.0,Hilarious teacher! Very knowledgable and smart. Very sarcastic and often bursts into song! The only class I haven't fallen asleep in
2605,1084544,5.0,4.0,"Outstanding teacher - class is never dull, he is extremely knowledgeable, fun to listen to... Tests are not easy, but if you study you will do well.  Easy grader, easy assignments (although there are many).  Gives study guide prior to all tests, and all material is covered.  Participation is necessary to do well in the class.  Definitely an A+"
2606,1084544,1.0,2.0,"Terrible teacher.  His lectures are all over the place, and his tests come from the book HE wrote, not the textbook that is required.  He's an easy grader, though, and even though his assignments are ridiculous, it is not a hard class at all."
2607,2583725,5.0,3.0,"For reference, I took this class in 2021, so still covid precautions. Due to this, actual attendance wasn't mandatory at the time. Be prepared to read a lot, though. The course is 99% from the reading. Pretty easy A if you read, though. Quizzes each week were really simple, but the exams were pretty heavy on writing."
2608,2583725,1.0,5.0,"Matt Lavine for Modern US history is terrifying. He admitted in class that as t he wasnt a competent teacher. Also, he tried to make history and extremely tough course even though all you need to take is a humanity. Its also all TA graded, which can vary from person to person and most of the questions are very opinionated!"
2609,2387126,1.0,3.0,Beyond frustrating! Had her for Comp 2 Spring 2019 and submitted a paper Feb. 19 but did not receive a grade until April 25. I went to the writing center at least once for every paper and still failed almost every essay I submitted. She takes off for things that aren't apparent to freshmen students who only take the class to get their degree.
2610,2387126,1.0,4.0,This teacher feels like she has something to prove with being a younger professor. Ill make an A on a paper in a 3000 level English lit class and shell fail me. She makes no sense and wants to make the class harder just because she can. Sad. Havent learned a thing.
2611,2387126,1.0,4.0,She expects too much out of someone who isnt even an english major.
2612,2387126,3.0,2.0,"Made it very clear she didn't enjoy teaching English comp. Slow grader. She's helpful during her office hours --which you'll need, because the comments she leaves on essays are super vague. A bit condescending. Easy to pass, just like most comp 1 classes. Cancels class often, which was a nice bonus."
2613,2387126,1.0,4.0,Ms. Baumgartner was a first-year teacher and didn't know what she was doing. She was close to my age but not relatable at all. Grades super difficult
2614,2542790,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Pirim is an okay teacher overall. He is not the best at teaching the material, but he does do his best to help you learn. We had 11 weekly quizzes and only the highest 8 counted. In addition, we had a comprehensive final. The class was very easy because he would give a review study guide of practice problems nearly identical to the quizzes. "
2615,2542790,3.0,2.0,Eng Econ is a pretty easy class overall just Pirim is not the professor you want. He english is very choppy which doesn't help when you are in a giant class and he doesn't show any interest in the topic hes teaching. The SI sessions are the key to pass this class. We had a quiz every friday but he gave us the actual questions on Wednesday.
2616,2542790,1.0,2.0,He really puts no effort into teaching or explaining anything he goes over many of the times he does the problem wrong and still just writes down the right answer. The only hope for this class is SI
2617,2542790,4.0,2.0,Dr. Pirim is a great teacher! He dropped our second test due to bad grades. He is a fair teacher and wants you to succeed. I would recommend him. Just follow the class examples and understand them for the tests. Very straight forward and great professor.
2618,2542790,4.0,2.0,It seems that everyone considers Dr. Pirim problematic? Here's the facts: 1. He works out problems. 2. He's a reasonable fellow (he knocked off a test question that didn't make sense and stumped us all) 3. His graders are grad students - not the incompetent children you go to class with. 4. IE isn't difficult. It may be beneficial to change majors.
2619,2542790,1.0,4.0,"It's not entirely his fault. But Engr Economy 1 with him is WAY harder than it should be. Test questions are pulled straight from the book and numbers are changed and are NOT WORDED WELL AT ALL, he's hard to understand, doesn't explain things very well. My grade is 100% at fault of the professor. Many people in this class feel the same as I do."
2620,2280661,5.0,2.0,Not a hard teacher at all. Gets off topic a lot. He is a very good teacher that is easy to talk to and is very interesting when teaching.
2621,2280661,4.0,4.0,"The homework is hard and the lecture doesn't cover it all, use Chegg. You will need to read the book to do really well, I didn't and got an A but I think reading the book would've made it a lot easier. Attending lecture is important because throughout it he will tell you things that are on the test for sure, or could easily make it to the test."
2622,2280661,5.0,2.0,"Dr. King is super cool and teaches multiple courses in the biochemistry department at MSU. He has good experience with laboratory research, as well as graduate school experience."
2623,2559189,2.0,2.0,"She does not respond to emails. If you need to email her about an assignment do not expect a response back, you will just have to go with your gut feeling and hope that it is the best. She will wait until the last minute to post lectures online. The directions to some of the assignments are not very clear."
2624,2559189,5.0,2.0,"I enjoyed her as a instructor because she was passionate about the subject. The lectures were pretty boring, but overall an easy class."
2625,2559189,2.0,3.0,Really boring and doesn't follow the syllabus. She doesn't post the examples or instructions on time like she's suppose to. She's even waited until 5:00 pm the day an assignment was due to post the instructions that were suppose to be there weeks ago. Doesn't respond to emails. Really leaves students in the dark
2626,2591964,5.0,2.0,He is the best at his job. He cares for each and every person in the class. And very fun to be around.
2627,2591964,5.0,2.0,"Great musician, loves his students. Number your measures the night you get music though or you'll hear about it."
2628,2559198,5.0,1.0,"She's a super fun person and her class was pretty easy. She tries to spice up her powerpoints to keep the students' attention. Her study guides are her tests basically. If she lets you out early but will stay for questions, STAY. She will give you more than she gave the rest of what will be on your test. Awesome teacher"
2629,2485478,1.0,5.0,"While Yuan Liu might be exceedingly smart, she has the ability to convey information similar to that of a brick wall. Her understanding of the English language (not just accent) is so bad that she can't understand any questions asked. Stay as far away unless you are great at self teaching with absolutely no material or notion of what to study."
2630,945388,5.0,1.0,Best American Gov teacher you can take. Will never read off a powerpoint. usually just comes in and talks about whatever he wants to talk about. about 3 tests. online.
2631,945388,4.0,2.0,"Intro to Law was very informative and fun. Great professor, mildly tough quizzes make sure to read. Not great about sending out information and did not like absences one bit."
2632,945388,1.0,5.0,Immediately no. The exams for this class were insane. He teaches as if he is real law professor teaching law students when we are UNDERGRAD. Will also tell you about assignments a month in advance just so you cant ask for an emergency extension.
2633,945388,5.0,1.0,"a funny, charismatic professor. easy test &amp; no homework"
2634,945388,5.0,2.0,Very laid back. Super easy american gov class
2635,945388,5.0,2.0,i took him for american government and by far one of the easiest classes ive ever taken. attendance doesnt count against you and al the tests are online
2636,945388,5.0,2.0,Took for American Government and LOVED him. Grade is based off 5 tests that are online and not honor locked.
2637,945388,5.0,1.0,"He is the best ever!! Only took 5 tests all online, very easy straight out of the notes and lectures. His lectures were very interesting, he doesn't just read off of a power point. Also he posts the notes after every lecture! TAKE him for American Gov! Would take 1,000 times over."
2638,945388,3.0,2.0,"I took Prof. Waide for Intro. to Law II. The class only had 4 writing assignments (with the average grade on each being about a 90). He didn't teach much useful information, but he invited a number of lawyers to come speak to us in class. They gave good speeches and told us about life as a lawyer. Decent class if you wanna hear about law practice."
2639,945388,1.0,2.0,"Not sure why this guy gets any form of love, dude literally does not care for his students whatsoever. It is like hes trying to be some movie teacher but cant accept the reality that he doesnt enjoy his job. University should look into this guys lack of motivation to quit being below average."
2640,945388,1.0,1.0,"If you have a pulse you'll get an A-plus in any of his courses, but if you actually want to get a return on your investment in education then avoid him at all cost. His whole class is him giving bad advice, talking himself up, inviting his friends to come hang out, and giving a completely wrong impression of what law school is actually like."
2641,945388,3.0,3.0,"This class is just fine. Waide is pretty easy to reach, and the tests are simple as long as you pay attention to lectures. The man doesn't have a single shred of compassion for students, though, so don't even think about crossing him. I guess he's trying to give you the true law school experience, which means being cold and dry."
2642,945388,1.0,1.0,"The easiest classes you'll ever take, but it is to the point that it is insulting you're actually paying for such low quality education. Also, steer clear of his law school advice as he tells kids to go to tier 3 school with terrible employment outcomes. Do you're own research on law schools."
2643,945388,5.0,2.0,"I had Professor Waide for Quest II. If you need an honors credit, take this class!! Not a ton of work but very discussion heavy class. He makes the class interesting and grades pretty lenient. He really cares about his students and wants them to succeed"
2644,945388,5.0,2.0,He is a good professor who makes it simple for what you have to do.
2645,945388,4.0,3.0,"He gives good lectures but sometimes he can be hard to understand. He has news quizzes that are based on articles that you have to read, and his different GA's write them so their difficulty varies. His tests are really specific."
2646,945388,5.0,1.0,Prof. Wade is very respected among students. Take him if you ever have a chance. He wants you to do well and will do whatever he can to make sure you do. His not &quot;easy&quot; but he doesn't make things hard just because he could. Very good professor.
2647,945388,5.0,2.0,He talks for probably 30 minutes and then lets you go. All of the test are online.
2648,945388,4.0,2.0,"The tests come straight from lecture. He posts notes from lecture on canvas. You do not have to show up to class on exam days. You can take them wherever you want and it can be with a group. If you miss more than 12 days, he takes away points from your grade. He has a great sense of humor. I would take him again."
2649,945388,1.0,1.0,"He really isnt much of a proffesor, as he just sits back and has other people come speak for him. His class is an absolute waste of time and an insult to anyone who can read past a 7th grade levels intelligence."
2650,945388,5.0,1.0,A teacher you MUST have. Hes hilarious and gives great lectures!
2651,945388,3.0,2.0,Class was easy but felt as if I couldnt go to him as a professor for help.
2652,945388,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Waide is awesome He's hilarious and knows his stuff. We don't use a textbook, so that's money saved. He only gives quizzes and tests, so if you like that kind of class, he's definitely a solid choice. If you need daily work to balance out your grades, look elsewhere. I really enjoyed his class."
2653,945388,4.0,1.0,Waide is hilarious in his lectures about government. His only grades are the quizzes about the articles his us to read. The only tests are the finals and midterms. Take him if you want an easy History grade.
2654,945388,5.0,1.0,"He is a very fun professor! He makes class very enjoying. He doesn't give many exams, and the quizzes he gives out are easy (they are over current event articles he sends you). He also offers some extra credit opportunities. His lectures are not boring and he uses good examples to teach. 10/10 recommend, he is a great professor!"
2655,945388,5.0,3.0,"Professor Waide is a great teacher who really cares about his students. If you aren't understanding something, just schedule an appointment with him. As long as you show up to class, pay attention, and take notes, he will see that you show up to class and know that you actually care about your grade which is what he wants to see."
2656,945388,5.0,3.0,Its easy to learn the material because the class is never boring even in a subject I didn't really find that interesting. His lectures incorporate how the political system is relevant to you to keep you interested. His lecture on Plato's allegory of the cave completely changed my perspective on a lot of things.
2657,945388,5.0,3.0,Waide is super funny and breaks things down in a way I've never seen a professor do before. He's not tech savvy so dont expect to find his notes online or even his syllabus. I missed some days of class but googled for study guides or guessed on exams and made it with a B. I suggest going to class for the A and just to hear his lectures.
2658,945388,5.0,4.0,"Whit Waide is the best professor you'll ever take. Super brutally honest and no BS. Make sure you study well for his tests, because that's the only grades in his class. It's good material, though. Highly recommend. If you don't like prof Waide, grow a pair"
2659,945388,4.0,3.0,Whit Waide is awesome! I took AP US Gov in high school so I really didn't need to go to class but if you are unfamiliar with American gov definitely go. Super funny as well!
2660,945388,4.0,4.0,"This guy. Simultaneously the hardest PS class I've ever taken and the one I've learned the most from. Never skipped a class due to how interesting it was. Hilarious, but tough. Not super accessible outside of class, but you still learn a lot. Gives all the information you need for tests, just wants to know that you can demonstrate what you learned."
2661,945388,5.0,3.0,best Professor at State
2662,945388,5.0,2.0,"He makes lectures interesting and the class is fairly easy. There are only 2 tests, which he gives broad study guides for. He gives quizzes over articles he sends out. Definitely one of the most enjoyable teachers I've had, very entertaining!"
2663,945388,5.0,3.0,"His lectures make up for his vague study guides. We only had a midterm and a final. He is hilarious and makes government interesting. His midterm was pretty hard,  I made a C. But the final was just like the study guide and I received an A so overall I ended up with a B. You have quizzes over news articles he sends. You take 5 and he drops lowest."
2664,945388,5.0,3.0,"His test can be hard, but his lectures make up for it. He also gives study guides, but they can be rather broad. Can miss up to 8 classes. Textbook not really needed."
2665,945388,5.0,2.0,"He is the spirit of Mississippi State University, and every student should take one class taught by him.  He's hilarious, but he still cares about his class learning the material.  Also, the class is not terribly hard if you pay attention and/or read the book."
2666,945388,3.0,1.0,Easy as pie professor.
2667,945388,5.0,3.0,Excellent. Such a fun professor.
2668,945388,5.0,3.0,"Whit Waide literally is the best professor that walks the earth! Before I took any of his courses, I was ignorant and close minded to pretty much everything. However, after taking his courses, I walked out with a more open minded view on people and our country."
2669,945388,4.5,1.0,"He is amazing, and wants you to think. He cares for his students and tries to make lecture easy. Never lectures the whole time. If you go to class and listen the midterm and final are easy. I would retake him in  a heartbeat!"
2670,945388,3.5,4.0,He always lets you out early and he's a great speaker. He's brutally honest with you. Take advantage of every extra-credit possibility. You will read like 8-10 legal cases a week. 
2671,945388,5.0,3.0,"He always lets you out of class early, but you cover a lot of information in one class-time. Will give quizzes on articles to read and most answers, if you read the articles, are pretty obvious.  Take notes in his class because what he is saying is actually interesting. Everyone should take him at one point in their years at Mississippi State."
2672,945388,4.0,1.0,"Professor Waide's class is easy and he is usually funny. His lectures are occasionally boring, but they never last long & he cancels classes pretty often. There are three or four quizzes that are off of articles that he sends a few days before. The midterm and final are both extremely easy."
2673,945388,5.0,3.0,"Whit Waide is by far the best professor a student and university could ask for.  His lectures are very easy to understand and are entertaining.  He has a wicked sense of humor.  He makes himself available to his students and is an considered a university-wide role model for MSU.  If you ever have a chance, I highly recommend any of his classes."
2674,945388,4.0,1.0,"Super easy quizes as long as you read the articles. Tests are short and easy to study for. He cusses alot but it's usually funny, wakes you up after a day long of classes."
2675,945388,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Waide is a very intelligent and helpful man. He will insult you, cuss you, and may even call you a terrorist a few times, but it's because he wants you to learn the material and do something about it. Important to read the articles, but the quizzes are common sense. Read the textbook and notes for the test. Take notes as best you can."
2676,945388,4.5,2.0,One of the most amazing teachers I have EVER had. Easy class as long as you read the articles he gives every few weeks. Lectures are interesting and funny. Everyone should take one of his classes before graduating.
2677,945388,1.5,5.0,"I did not enjoy his class at all. It was extremely hard. We had to read about 11 articles every wk & then take a quiz on them (almost impossible to pass b/c there were so many articles to read). The only test we took was the final, so there was no preparation for it at all. It was hard to take notes b/c he was never clear on what we should write."
2678,945388,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Loves what he is doing and it shows. Definitely tries to help all students. If you do the work, this will be an easy A. Incredibly smart and well versed in his subject. VERY HELPFUL to all students"
2679,945388,4.5,2.0,He is one of the best teacher I have seen. He is really funny and teaches real world stuff.
2680,945388,4.5,1.0,"Great Teacher, Fun Class , Knows his stuff. test are pretty easy if you read his articles."
2681,945388,4.0,2.0,One of best teachers at state. Very funny and interesting guy. Lawyer. Knows his stuff.
2682,945388,3.0,4.0,I do not recommend this teacher his grading is unfair yet his tests seem so easy. He counts answers wrong on your test that he counted right on others' tests. The class is interesting yet you would think it would be an easy A or B.
2683,945388,5.0,1.0,"You would have to just not show up to class in order to fail this class. He allows dropped grades and replaces quiz grades with extra credit, so you would have to be extremely stupid to not pass this class. He's really funny and makes American Government interesting and makes you think."
2684,945388,5.0,1.0,"He's really funny and definitely knows what he's talking about. Personally, I think you have to be extremely stupid to not pass the class because he gives you so many chances and the quizzes aren't hard if you show up to class and pay attention."
2685,945388,2.5,3.0,"I did not like him, he missed to many days of class and still expected you know everything. His test are short answer and come from lectures/readings. Did not enjoy."
2686,945388,5.0,2.0,Very informative. Be respectful and Do not be late!!!! His personal gov't experiences make class fun.
2687,945388,4.5,2.0,Took This past Semester. learned alot.
2688,945388,5.0,2.0,Great prof. i would recommend for anyone taking government or any other class he teaches. great person and great prof.
2689,945388,5.0,2.0,Awesome teacher. Very helpful. Brings in speakers and discusses relevant issues. Fun and amiable.
2690,1281272,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Harris was an okay teacher. I thought this class would be an easy A, but her tests are kind of difficult. She lets you have a cheat sheet for every test. You have to read the plays that she assigns the class and take a quiz, and she makes the questions so you can't cheat. Also the quizzes are timed so if you try to cheat you wont have time. "
2691,1281272,4.0,2.0,"I took Mel for Intro to Theatre. Her lectures are all slide shows that she presents which get to be really long and sometimes boring if you don't pay attention. You will lose lots of points if you skip this class a lot and she only has 5 quizzes, 4 tests and 2 major assignments so make sure you don't forget about every assignment"
2692,1281272,3.0,4.0,Attendance is mandatory you can only have 3 absences for the whole semester. But besides that she is great and the class is extremely easy. Shes also really easy to get into touch with.
2693,1281272,3.0,3.0,"Mel's class isn't too difficult if you are willing to write notes, especially for the last two tests. You are allowed a cheat sheet on every test (front and back). Be prepared to be annoyed by very bad theatre jokes. Attendance is what kept me out of a A as with every absence after 3, you lose a point on your final grade."
2694,1281272,5.0,3.0,"Liked the class even though I am not a theatre major. She is definitely a little quirky, but is passionate about Theatre 100%. Definitely go to class and write every word she says. It will show up on the test. You are allowed one cheat sheet for the test, cram as much as you can on there. Grades are mainly tests with a few smaller assignments."
2695,1281272,4.0,2.0,"She is a really fun professor and really cares about her class! Some of the content can be a bit boring at times, but she really tries to make it fun and engaging. You get to write a cheat sheet for every test, and sometimes she gives extra credit quizzes. Her tests are pretty easy most of the time, and she really cares about her students!"
2696,1281272,4.0,1.0,Mrs. Harris was a great teacher. She was very engaging and entertaining. You get a cheat sheet on every test and you don't have to take the exam if you attend all the test dates. Super duper easy and theres also optional extra credit on days with low attendance.
2697,1281272,5.0,2.0,"She is one of the best professors ever. Her class is not difficult, and I really enjoy attending the class. We had four tests and a few extra assignments here and there, but her tests are straightforward. She is super interactive and loves feedback from students, and she is not shy to being herself, which is AWESOME!!!!!"
2698,1281272,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Harris is a super fun teacher. She tells stories &amp; keeps the lectures interesting. She sometimes gives free extra credit if not much of the class shows up. The plays are usually interesting &amp; the tests are super easy. She allows you to use a cheat sheet on every test, including the final. There is a theatre review, but it is not hard at all."
2699,1281272,5.0,1.0,"A real gem! Very funny and engaging, she makes class so much fun. Allows up to 5 absences with no consequence and a cheat sheet for every test including the final exam. Show up, take notes, and read the plays (very short plays at that) and you'll be fine. Seriously recommend her!"
2700,1281272,4.0,2.0,Intro to Theatre with Melanie Harris is a pretty easy A. She lets you use a cheat sheet for tests which helps a lot. You have to read a couple plays and attend a play and write a review. She's funny in class and definitely makes the class fun and interesting. She even brought her dog to class a couple times.
2701,1281272,5.0,2.0,"This class is a great class to take if you need an elective. It is very straight forward, and you do get a cheat sheet for the test. Although our class had to read three plays they were all less than 150 pages. Most of the test questions pertaining to the books, the answers could be found on Spark notes. The class is an easy A with minimal work."
2702,1281272,4.0,2.0,"This class is really easy as long as you pay attention in class. You get a ""cheat sheet"" for every test: you can write down anything on the sheet as long as it fits on a piece of notebook paper. You have to go to a theatre production and write a critique. That's it basically.  Melanie is very funny and sweet. I found her class entertaining."
2703,1281272,3.5,1.0,She's a great teacher! She understands that most people taking her class aren't huge theatre people so she's not grading too hard. Make sure you pay attention though and take a few notes if she doesn't post them online.
2704,1281272,5.0,1.0,"She was great! She puts her notes online and the tests are open note! She also goes over everything in class and gives many extra credit opportunities. She is fun, energetic, and very enthusiastic about teaching. Mrs. Melanie was my favorite teacher! It would be hard to not have a good grade in her class."
2705,1281272,4.5,1.0,"Her notes are straight forward, and the tests aren't TOO hard, but they are somewhat confusing. Attendandce is taken every day and as far as the group project goes, She gives you a month.. i did it the day before it was due and got a 98, so this class is easy.. take it if you need a GPA booster."
2706,1281277,4.0,2.0,Interesting life - when you get him talking.
2707,1281277,4.5,2.0,"Really, great made it interesting.  Influenced me to major in geoscience"
2708,1281277,4.0,2.0,This class is easy.. DO NOT BUY THE SOLAR SYSTEM TEXT BOOK! YOU DONT USE IT! You do however need &quot;A short history of nearly everything&quot;.. you have to read that book and summarize each chapter. He is EXTREMELY liberal with extra points and you have to be somewhat mentally handicapped to fail this class. Good teacher overall
2709,1281278,2.0,5.0,Feel terrible for saying this but want to be honest it was the worst class I've ever taken. Not only was it sooo boring but there was way to much homework for what it was. If this is an elective for you find something else like creative writing. Unless you want to spend your entire semester writing papers and have no social life or time for other classes...
2710,1281278,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Hanshaw's class might have been the most boring waste of time class ever. She gives unannounced reading quizes that are next to impossible to make up if you miss them, also.. her class is the exact same every day. You read stories from your $200 textbook and then discuss them. EVERY.. SINGLE.. DAY.. Take another prof."
2711,1993985,1.0,4.0,"Honestly One of the worst teachers I have had in a while. He speaks in monotone and every other word is ""Um"". Don't take this class with him if you are given other options. Seriously. The online quizzes are timed and you only have 15 minutes to answer 10 questions. The tests are not like lectures."
2712,2419970,4.0,4.0,"This class overall is extremely hard. She gives you working papers to follow along with her PowerPoints. The assignments consist of 4 tests and lots of homework grades. Personally, I had to start studying at least a week in advance to do good on the tests. If you do not go to class, you will not pass. Make sure to read the chapters and study."
2713,2419970,5.0,3.0,"I took Financial Accounting with Professor Milbach and I think she is one of the best teachers you can take. It's a difficult class and requires a lot of study time no matter which professor you take, but she provided a lot of help and study materials. Reading the textbook helps so much! She is great when it comes to contacting outside of class."
2714,2419970,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Milbach is the best! Financial accounting is a hard class, but she gives lots of resources and is always available to help students. Her lectures are great, and she is always there to answer questions. She tries to explain things in ways that students will understand and she works through problems really clearly!"
2715,2419970,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Milbach is the best you can take for financial accounting, but this class is super hard. There is a lot of homework. You have to study a ton for each test or you probably will not pass. If you fail the first test, do not continue forward in the class because it only gets harder from there. If you HAVE to take this class, take Dr. Milbach."
2716,2419970,5.0,4.0,Financial Accounting is just a hard course and it's one that you have to put in a ton of work to pass. Dr. Milbach was an amazing professor. She was very accessible through email and her office hours. I would recommend making sure you fully comprehend material on the 1st test bc it will benefit you the rest of class.
2717,2419970,5.0,3.0,"Lauren Milbach is hands down the best professor I've ever had. She is so enthusiastic about her class and is super helpful if you ever need any extra help. Accounting is a hard class anyways, and she tries to make it as simple as possible for you. 100% would take her for every accounting class if I could."
2718,2419970,5.0,4.0,"Accounting at MS State is take very seriously, so with any teacher it is still a difficult class. Milbach was always kind and understanding. Also, she sends reminders before assignments, so it is unlikely you will miss an assignment due to an unknown due date."
2719,2419970,5.0,3.0,"The class isn't that hard, but it does require a LOT of study time. I got a loose-leaf copy of the textbook and highlighted and took notes on the pages- that's how I made an A on every test. Stay on top of things!! Overall, she's a great prof. Always answers questions and does her best to help students. Take her!!"
2720,2419970,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher, the class is hard no matter what and she makes it so much easier for you. Super helpful during lectures to get you to understand the material as well as possible."
2721,2419970,3.0,3.0,Go to class and do the in class working papers and you'll understand most of it. Study her slides and the in class working papers for the exams and you'll do good. Not hard but not easy. Lots of online homework. 3 attempts for homework and after the first 2 attempts it gives you the right answers so you should get a 100 on all of the homework.
2722,2239757,5.0,2.0,Best accounting professor I've ever had.
2723,2239757,5.0,3.0,Dr Berglund is one of the best teachers ive got the chance to learn from. His lectures are very interesting and he covers everything you need to know. The exams are easy if you pay attention in class and take notes. He also helps you outside of class during his office time If you are struggling or have any other questions.
2724,2239757,5.0,4.0,Very great teacher I would definitely take him again!
2725,2239757,5.0,4.0,"There are online quizzes through Cengage for each chapter. They were kinda tough but you have to read the book and slides to get a good understanding conceptually. The tests are a mixture of short answer, multiple-choice &amp; true/false. Listen to his lectures, take notes on the slides, read the book, and take advantage of any extra credit."
2726,2239757,4.0,3.0,"He was interesting and very practical about what actually matters. Paying attention in class helps, especially when it's your turn on the front row. The tests are hard, and the quizzes are a nightmare. Do the Becker's practice for the free A's on quizzes."
2727,2239757,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Berglund really prepared me with good background knowledge for my accounting internship. If you study, you will do fine. Tests are write outs, but he grades very fairly! Definitely recommend him!!"
2728,2239757,5.0,3.0,"There are online quizzes and the tests are pretty much completely written. However, he usually does put some multiple choice. It does take reading the book and a decent amount of studying to pass the tests."
2729,2239757,5.0,3.0,Mr. Berglund was the best!!! Would 100% recommend!!! He literally saved my life this class bc I suck at accounting so bad
2730,2239757,5.0,4.0,He's willing to work with you to understand the material. He tries to tell you exactly what will be on the exams.
2731,2239757,5.0,4.0,He wants to help you understand. Participate in class. Ask questions. Actually know and understand how to do the homework and you'll be fine
2732,1740047,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Salter is really helpful for the group project you will have to do. He's strict but also nice. It's a pretty boring class though, and he does take attendance. He talks about himself a lot. The best part is that he will let you add him as a reference on a job application, which is really good."
2733,2305301,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Thompson is a great teacher. I had him for intro to sociology and he is really great. If you can take him, take him. Attendance is required and there are weekly quizzes online. Easy A if you put in a little effort."
2734,2305301,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Thompson has been nothing but kind, understanding, and helpful during my time in his class. Halfway through the semester I began dealing with a nerve disorder, causing me to miss class, and he was quite caring and excused my absences and offered feedback outside class. He's funny, smart, engaging, and an all-around great guy."
2735,2305301,4.0,3.0,Dr. Thompson teaches a solid class. He's very passionate about sociology and really wants you to engage with the material. Has an accent but not hard to understand. The extra credit system is really nice so take advantage of it. Biggest of all: don't forget about online quizzes! They're weighted heavily and can really screw up your grade.
2736,2305301,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Thompson cares about his students and this class. I accidentally left a whole page on an exam blank and he let me come to his office and finish it- just that page. Most teachers would make you retake the whole thing, if they even let you retake it. Thick accent &amp; strict on technology, but GREAT teacher! Just participate."
2737,2305301,1.0,1.0,What even are the tests in this class?? Theyre weighted so weirdly and the homework is even worse. Good side is ya dont have to come to class to pass
2738,2305301,1.0,1.0,You can do whatever in this class and he doesnt care. People have their phones and laptops out all the time watching movies or listening to music. Its so freaking distracting!!! But theyre all passing apparently. You can bullcrap everything and get an A whether you try or not. People are disrespectful to him and he doesnt really do anything.
2739,1928476,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Dornshuld gets a lot of hate. At times he can appear standoffish and a bit rude, but he really does care about how well student do in his class. He puts a lot of time and effort into his website and if you do the homework you should do well. This is a hard class, but Dr. Dornshuld teaches it well."
2740,1928476,1.0,5.0,"Dornshuld coded his own website for students to use as a resource for the class. Cheaters accessing the website during a test are tracked down via IP address which is a major breach of student privacy in my opinion regardless if a student was cheating or not. If you are going to take a chem class where they use dornshulds website, use a VPN."
2741,1928476,1.0,5.0,Cares about my education more than I do. Lame.
2742,1928476,1.0,5.0,"dornshuld has coded his own website for students to use as a resource for the class. Cheaters accessing the website during a test are tracked down via IP address which is a major breach of student privacy in my opinion regardless if a student was cheating or not. If you are going to take a chem class where they use dornshulds website, use a VPN. "
2743,1928476,2.0,5.0,Dornschuld is a fine professor. I recommend avoiding all chemistry at MSU if given the chance. The worst part of this class are the two tests right at the end of the semester. You will go into these exams likely with an A if you do the homework on time and correctly. But both exams are incredibly tough and are not curved. They will kill your grade.
2744,1928476,1.0,5.0,"Terrible.This is currently your only professor option for Chem II. I took Dornshuld after the university came back from the pandemic. Tests count for a ridiculous amount for your grade, so if you fail them theres no hope in passing the class. Every question on the exam was timed, so there was immense pressure on trying to solve difficult questions."
2745,1928476,3.0,4.0,"I have mixed emotions, while his class was incredibly fun and I learned a lot, the way the test are set up is horrible. The Chem department needs to be looked at! He was a great teacher, chem at state just isn't great. "
2746,1928476,1.0,5.0,"horrible teacher and cares even less about his students, only missed like 3 classes and I swear i never learned a thing from him HE CANNOT TEACH."
2747,1928476,5.0,3.0,Dr. Dornshuld is fun to talk to in general and has a good sense of humor. Some say that he is mean and rude but he just doesn't like repeating himself over and over again. Best professor I have had so far! He explains the content very very well.
2748,1928476,3.0,4.0,"He is very intense on grading, and of course the subject is hard, but he breaks everything down very well. He makes things understandable and gives many quizzes, but an extended time to work on them."
2749,1928476,4.0,4.0,"Dornshould is a great professor in my opinion. Somedays he is stressed and abrasive, but he is a good guy who wants his students to succeed. He has many resources that are available the are very beneficial. He assigns quizzes that have unlimited attempts, and he made a website that very extensively explains the lessons he teaches in class."
2750,1928476,1.0,4.0,Worst professor I've ever had. The first test that he gives is at the end of November and then two weeks later you take the ACS final. He is very snarky and not nice at all. He teaches as if his class is the only one students are taking. Steer clear if at all possible.
2751,1928476,3.0,4.0,There are mandatory canvas quizzes (ab two to three a week) that arent horrible if u know what ur doing. his website is rly helpful but theres only two exams the entire year so you need to do well on the canvas quizzes. you can tell he genuinely cares that we do well it j comes across mean.
2752,1928476,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Dornshuld really cares about his students and wants each of them to succeed. He may seem like he does not care during lecture, but if you ask him a question after class or during office hours he will eagerly engage with you and address your questions. Put in effort and do your own work and and he will work with you- he's a great professor!"
2753,1928476,5.0,1.0,"Dornshuld comes off as a rude and disrespectful professor, but in reality he tries to just choose the best path to allow for his students to succeed. He genuinely cares about his students and wants everyone to do well in his class. As long as you do the homework and follow his directions it's an easy class to pass."
2754,1928476,5.0,3.0,"Dornshuld comes off as rude and inconsiderate to those who don't try in his class. If you put in the work, go to his office hours and turn work in on time, I can PROMISE you will pass. Dornshuld is nice and wants to see his students succeed, but in the right way. He hates cheaters and he WILL find out if you cheat. He's also very funny. HIGHLY RECC"
2755,1928476,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Dornshuld is a good professor, but for some reason, he tries to act like he does not care about his students. This, however, is untrue. He wants all of his students to do great. He does more for his students than any other professor. His website also helps out a lot. Best choice for general chemistry."
2756,1928476,5.0,2.0,"Dornshuld is an amazing professor. He expects you to participate in class, and that is not hard to do. As long as you pay attention and put forth effort, you can make a good grade in his class. His tests are stressful due to the questions being timed, but he is an amazing teacher. I always felt well prepared for the tests."
2757,1928476,5.0,4.0,"For as many people who give Dornshuld crap, he is one of the greatest teachers I know. Chem II isn't an easy class, but he is very understanding and willing to help students if you put in the effort. This isn't an easy A class but if you work with Dornshuld, he will work with you. Go to office hours, he will respect you so much. Loved his class."
2758,1928476,5.0,5.0,"I was scared coming into Dr. Dornshulds class because everyone told me it was their 2nd time taking this course b/c he was such a hard professor... I have an A and its not that difficult. Chem II is supposed to be a hard class. Hes not rude at all, he just gets upset about cheating and posting his hw questions on chegg which is understandable."
2759,1928476,4.0,2.0,"Make sure you do the fun exam because it will help your grade a lot. I didn't think I would like dornshuld at first, but he grew on me. He's pretty fair and funny, and I like going to class. It's not that hard if you read the textbook and look at his example problems. Tests are timed by question so you have to practice before."
2760,1928476,1.0,4.0,"There are many professors that care about their students and are willing to admit mistakes, Dr. Dornshuld is not one of them. He cares more about catching cheaters and coming off as snarky than actually teaching, and it's common for him to rant instead of actually teaching for an entire class period. He also uses the worst testing method available."
2761,1928476,1.0,4.0,"He literally said in class if he comes off as rude or condescending, it's because he was used to teaching off sequence and called teaching them, &quot;like teaching a class of delinquents.&quot; I literally don't know what possesses someone to say that. The lecture slides have little to no information, and he doesn't work example problems. Just take Nettles."
2762,1928476,5.0,3.0,"No matter what class you take in the chemistry department, you will have to be willing to put the work into the class. Chemistry will never be an easy A, but Dr. Dornshuld is a great professor. Yes, a little sarcastic and condescending but it is all a part of his dry sense of humor. I would take him over and over again. A great professor!"
2763,1928476,2.0,5.0,"Dornschuld is easily one of the most condescending, sarcastic, and rude professors I have ever had. Going to class was almost pointless every time just because he would get through two slides and rant about how stupid we are. He wants us to pass the class, but does not make it easy to. I would take anyone else for Chem 2 if possible."
2764,1928476,5.0,4.0,Dr. Dornshuld is a great teacher. He gives you absolutely everything you need to succeed. He is very kind and his lectures are interesting. He is very clear about what is expected in his class. Attend his office hours because those are helpful. He genuinely wants his students to do well.
2765,1928476,2.0,4.0,"If you have anxiety then don't attend class and watch his lecture videos instead. He complains or rants most of class and berates you for not understanding the material immediately. Best advice I can give to pass is to watch &quot;the organic chemistry tutor&quot; on YouTube. He's funny and seems like a nice guy, but just isn't the best in class teacher."
2766,1928476,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Dornshuld is incredibly strict, but he goes the extra mile for his students and puts all of the material on his own website. It's one of the most helpful tools and will be key to helping you pass. He's also pretty funny- does rant, though. Good guy."
2767,1928476,2.0,4.0,"He is incredibly blunt to the point that students are scared to ask questions. When we did, he would often ridicule us in class for asking a question. Once the class went online in March, he did not post powerpoints or lecture videos, we were simply left to fend for ourselves with the textbook. Avoid at all costs, take Dr. Nettles instad!"
2768,1928476,4.0,3.0,Explains concepts well and relates to students by telling jokes. Actually will get mad if you ask a stupid question. Read through the online textbook and take notes to excel in the class. Tests are tough but if you study you will do fine.
2769,1928476,1.0,5.0,The worst teacher I have ever had in my life. He acted as if we should already know everything and everyone was scared to even ask a question in class. It felt as if he found joy in us making mistakes or not being successful. Overall he knows his stuff but I did not find lectures very helpful he mainly talks at you and shows very few examples.
2770,1928476,3.0,4.0,"I like chemistry, and Dornshuld was a pretty decent teacher. Class is mandatory, and he gives frequent pop quizzes that are usually just scan-in for a grade. So GO TO CLASS! He cracks jokes occasionally, but hes a little rude when you ask a question, even if the answer isnt obvious."
2771,1928476,3.0,4.0,"He has very very high expectations and wants to see people putting in as much effort as possible. If youre not willing to participate in class and be prepared with questions for lecture then youre not going to enjoy lecture as much. Personally, he intimidates me big time and made it very hard for me to make up work from an excused absence."
2772,1928476,5.0,4.0,"The teachers for Chem 2 this semester were phenomenal. If you are a really fast learner and want to see real life applications, Dornshuld is your guy. Really funny in lectures and really clear grading on 4 exams, Final, homework, and quizzes (which are attendance based in class). Real gem of a teacher for the subject and knows his stuff."
2773,1928476,1.0,5.0,"At first I thought he was going to be a good teacher. He was really smart and knew his stuff, but he acted like we should already know it. He also would get really mad and ridicule you if you asked a question, even during office hours. I was not impressed overall."
2774,1928476,3.0,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about Dr. Dornshuld. On the one hand his lectures are pretty easy to follow and inform. On the other hand he also spends a lot of time going on tangents in the middle of class, some of which are funny but others of which seem a little unnecessary. He wants his students to work hard, so he is harsh if you ask a dumb question."
2775,1928476,1.0,4.0,"There are bad teachers, and then there are bad teachers who think that they are good. Dornshuld is a smart guy, but his arrogance and pessimism made him very hard to learn from. To him, asking questions means that you never took the time to try to learn and study the material. I managed an A solely from the textbook."
2776,1928476,1.0,5.0,Terrible professor!! I thought he was nice at the beginning of the semester but then he started getting an attitude and being rude to students. He thinks you should already know everything and doesn't actually teach the material. I rely on my SI more than him to teach me the material. If you have to take chem 2 take Dr. Nettles.
2777,1928476,1.0,5.0,"In my opinion, he did not teach very well. He got off topic very easily. He made jokes and complained about people more than teaching the class. He asked the class a question on something not yet covered and when no one had an answer for him, he got an attitude. He doesn't go over any math problems. He expects everyone to know how to do it."
2778,1928476,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Dornshuld is, without a doubt, one of the best professors I have ever had. Chem 2 itself is a hard subject, but he makes it as easy to learn as possible (as long as you are willing to work), and he will teach you how to think critically - essential for a STEM career. I find him to be hilarious, and he is very accessible during office hours."
2779,1928476,4.0,5.0,"I took him for chem 2. I did not take chem 1 at this college or with this professor, so that made some things harder. He does do &quot;pop quizzes&quot; which is just you scanning your ID a second time. He's pretty moody in class and gets mad if people don't participate. He's very nice in person though and even holds help sessions on weekends."
2780,1928476,4.0,5.0,"Tests are difficult, but if you go to SI sessions and his help sessions for homework, you will be fine. I would also heavily advise reading the book and going over the problems in the book because they break down the problems that he quickly goes over in class. He also gives random bonus points on random days just for showing up."
2781,1928476,1.0,4.0,He is the worst professor ever!! He doesn't reply to any of the emails. It makes fun of all the students in the class. WORST!!!
2782,1928476,5.0,4.0,Dornshuld was my favorite teacher last semester. His lectures seemed very well put together and if you sit towards the front he WILL talk to you before class (making it easier to go to his office hours later on). The content of the class is NOT easy but he will do everything he can to help(extra cred). He even held Saturday sessions to help us out.
2783,1928476,3.0,5.0,"His lectures are very fast paced and at times extremely hard to follow. Homework is pretty heavy and exams are very hard to make anything higher than a C on. However, Dornshuld makes it very clear that he does care about your grade and is very helpful outside of class. Holds help sessions on Saturdays and is hilarious during lecture."
2784,1928476,5.0,4.0,"Honestly, would not have passed Chem 1 without Dornshuld. Hands down the best Chemistry professor at Mississippi State. 10/10 would definitely recommend. Lectures from the beginning of class to the end, but never leaves you bored.. If you're struggling, GO TO OFFICE HOURS, he will do what he can to help you!"
2785,1928476,5.0,4.0,"You get what you put into it. If you make an effort to know him and make sure he knows you, hes a really good teacher. He is always willing to help you if you dont understand the material. He is very funny and likes to use jokes to help you understand. 10/10 would take again."
2786,1928476,5.0,4.0,Chemistry is not an easy subject. The tests werent easy either but you have to study. He give you chances if you fail and help all you have to do is try. Also it is very important to do your homework and make good grades on it.
2787,1928476,5.0,4.0,holds help sessions on Saturdays that are very helpful!
2788,1928476,4.0,4.0,Dr. Dornshould is a very good teacher. I didnt go into chemistry knowing very much but he was good a relaying information. The people who dont like Dr. Dornshould are those who dont do anything extra to help themselves. My favorite thing about Dornshould is that he would spend time on the weekends to let students come ask him questions. Good guy
2789,1928476,4.0,4.0,Chem was super hard but he's a good teacher and knows what he's talking about. God forbid you ask a simple question that he may consider dumb because he'll make you feel stupid. If you don't understand the material in class then you have to teach it to yourself
2790,1928476,3.0,4.0,"Dornshuld is a great teacher. Every comment for the fall 2018 semester on him was correct sadly, but if you want a teacher who will actually teach you information that you will retain, take him!! I learned NOTHING in chem 1. I worked for my grade this semester, and I actually enjoyed taking the time to learn the material."
2791,1928476,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Dornshuld is a really great professor. I had him for both Chemistry one and two. He really cares about his students and will help you to understand the subject as best as he can. He teaches from power points slides and posts them online. Going to his office can really make a ton of difference, get to know him, he's not intimidating as most say."
2792,1928476,4.0,1.0,Dornshuld was a very enjoyable for class. The class itself was honestly a joke and I think that he too knew that to a degree but he made the most of it and tried his best to make it beneficial and fun. He is very hilarious but take whatever he says as sarcastic humor and not seriously. He does notice if you are not in class and does not cut slack.
2793,1928476,3.0,4.0,"Was not a bad professor but tended to be very bipolar during class, getting angry if people didnt answer during class as well. He changed exam 4 one or two weeks before it was supposed to be and made it cumulative but did allow us to have a notecard with info. He was extremely rude when I went to his office hours without a reason."
2794,1928476,5.0,3.0,"Probably the best chem professor youll have. Go to class or you wont understand what youre doing. Theres four main tests and then the ACS final. The homework is helpful for the tests but its a lot. Dont be afraid to ask him for help, hes always in his office"
2795,1928476,2.0,3.0,"At first, Dr. Dornshuld was funny and seemed to care about the success of his students. However, following Test 3 he found out about students cheating(maybe 15 out of a few hundred). He went on a power trip and screwed everyone that didn't cheat by making Test 4 cumulative two days before the final. It's a shame how wrong first impressions can be."
2796,1928476,5.0,3.0,"This guy is awesome, whether you suck at Chem or do well, he is the guy to take. He makes himself available even when not typical office hours (with or without a heads up). He genuinely wants you to pass his class. Class can be fun or not, just depends one the students. Does quizzes, sometimes the quiz is attendance to help boost scores."
2797,1928476,5.0,4.0,He's a great teacher that cares about the success of his students. His test are a lot of information so you have to study. Going to the SI sessions will help and I highly suggest it. Just do the work and you'll pass.
2798,1928476,5.0,3.0,Very good at explaining things. Goes above and beyond if you ask for extra explanations. Bonus test questions and lots of humor!
2799,1928476,5.0,4.0,Would take for every chemistry class
2800,1928476,5.0,4.0,"His tests are like the practice problems and test. Do not scan and leave. He turned in multiple people into the honor code board. If you truly care about your grades, you wont do that anyway. I sat in the very front, so I git to catch all the little stuff. I usedhis office hours a lot TAKE HIM, but do NOT expect him to hand you your grade."
2801,1928476,5.0,4.0,Very fair and grades quickly.
2802,1928476,4.0,4.0,"Chem 2 is a tough class due to the material, but Dr Dornshuld made it interesting and simplified as much as he could! Homework was a bit heavy, with both online and paper homework assignments. Accessible in office hrs, and he sometimes even showed up at the tutoring center to help students! Genuinely seems to care about your success in the course."
2803,1928476,4.0,3.0,Can't tell how old he is. He's like 20 and 40 at the same time. Actually speaks clear English for once( not many Chem teachers do).
2804,1928476,3.0,5.0,Okay
2805,1928476,4.0,4.0,Had Dr. D for Chem 1 and Chem 2. He is very straight forward but loves to challenge his students on tests. He tries to trick you on tests but forewarns you about it. I did not take chem in high school so it was an intriguing class for me. Definitely take him though! He is willing to help and studies with students most of the time too!
2806,1928476,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Dornshuld is one of those teachers that the first day you want to drop his class because he can kind of come off as a bit of a jerk BUT then you quickly realize just how caring this man is. He goes out of his way to help his students succeed. The end of this past semester, he sent us a huge email detailing how much he believes in us. TAKE HIM!"
2807,1928476,4.0,3.0,Dr. Dornshuld is a very good teacher and does a good job keeping class interesting. He doesn't always give the easiest tests but he usually helps you out by offering a bonus question or allowing you one free question on the multiple choice section. I would definitely recommend him over the other Chem 1 and Chem 2 teachers.
2808,1928476,5.0,4.0,"Dornshuld comes off as a terrible person at first, but through the semester you realize he REALLY cares about the success of his students. Chemistry itself is hard material, but he offers lots of resources to help out his students. You have to study HARD for this class, but if you do then you should get an A or B."
2809,1928476,5.0,3.0,"The first day of class you will meet Dr. Dornshuld, he comes off as a bit arrogant, but as the semester goes on, he really goes out of his way to help you. Giving you some equations on the test, telling you how much he wants you to succeed. You can really tell this guy cares about his students."
2810,1928476,4.0,4.0,"He's a really great teacher, but you have to be ready to put in some work! Excellent, and very enthusiastic. The man will bend over backwards to make sure you're good, just ASK!"
2811,1928476,4.0,5.0,He is a great teacher but the material is hard. Study early!!
2812,1928476,4.0,4.0,"Although Chemistry is very hard, Dornshul is very good at his job. He creates the tests for Gen. Chem 1 & 2. He holds review sessions that often has problems from the test. He shows snap chats in his class and loves to interact with his students. He often walks around asking how you are. He does not tolerate cheaters so do NOT cheat in his class!!"
2813,1928476,4.0,3.0,"I took him for chem 1 and 2 and I honestly love his teaching! For chem 1 we had an option to add 50 points to the mini exam if we missed less than 3 classes, but that was taken away in chem 2. I got an A in chem 1 and a B in chem 2. He is super funny and energetic, but if you get offended easily don't take him because his jokes can be offensive"
2814,1928476,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic guy. Lectures are humorous, not super technical, but very quick. He is very direct about what will be and will not be on the test. Read the test questions carefully! They are simple but require close attention to what specific things they are asking. If you go to him after class, he will go to the moon and back to help explain anything."
2815,1928476,4.0,4.0,He's a good teacher who is willing to help you out outside of class.
2816,1928476,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Dornshuld is a very good chem teacher. He posts all of his notes online, gives bonus if you have 3 or less absences, holds review sessions before each test (trust me, you want to go, he basically gives you the test), he is very funny and makes the class interesting. Definitely taking him for chem 2."
2817,1928476,5.0,4.0,Dr. Dornshuld is a great chem teacher. He goes into detail about the information and explains it very well. If you get 3 or less absences you get bonus points. He is good with responding to emails and answering questions you have. Go to the review sessions before each test (he basically gives you the test). I am definitely taking him for chem 2.
2818,1928476,4.0,3.0,"Dornschuld makes the confusing concepts of chemistry make sense and seem relevant. He has a nice sense of humor too, which keep lectures lively.  He's obsessed with Star Wars and gave our class bonus points for dressing up like the characters at one of his exams. He gave bonus points for having less than 3 absences from lecture and recitation."
2819,1928476,4.0,4.0,"Great guy. Do not scan in and then leave, he will send you to the honor code board. Go to his review sessions. Go to his office hours."
2820,1928476,5.0,4.0,"I truly don't know how to adequately put all that I want to say in a mere 350 characters, but Dr. Dornshuld is, as MC Hammer would say, ""2 Legit 2 Quit."" But in all seriousness, regardless of the difficulty, I greatly enjoyed his class, and have signed up for his Chem II class next semester. 10/10 would recommend."
2821,1928476,5.0,4.0,Dr. Dornshuld is amazing if you actually put in the effort. If you need help he is defiantly there to help you. Overall he is amazing!!
2822,1928476,5.0,4.0,"I went into his class expecting something different than what I got. Professor Dornshuld is a great teacher! He explains everything multiple ways to make sure that you fully understand the material. If you go to his office hours, he will do anything that it takes to make sure you understand the material before you leave. DEFINITELY TAKE HIS CLASS."
2823,1928476,4.0,4.0,Dr. D moves quickly but he does a good job of covering the material.  Tests tend to contain trick questions and questions from previous chapters.  He gives a review for the final exam that is very helpful.  Dr. D genuinely wants students to understand the material.  He once gave a Star Wars themed test which was kind of strange.
2824,1928476,3.0,4.0,There are two things you need to do well in this class. 1)Effort 2)Attendance  Neither of which are optional.
2825,1928476,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Dornshuld is by far the best chemistry professor at MSU! He has high expectations for his class, but he helps out tremendously! He is willing to answer your questions. The final is standardized so if you have Dornshuld you will do good on the final! He is great during lecture. You can tell he is passionate about chemistry and he is funny!"
2826,1928476,2.0,5.0,Very unreasonable individual
2827,1928476,4.5,4.0,"If you are going to take chem 1 at  MS State then I highly recommend this guy. I seriously suck at chemistry, but he conveyed the material in a way that was relatively easy for me to learn. If you go to his review sessions and attend class then you'll do fine on the tests. Also he's damn entertaining in lecture so it wasn't really boring!"
2828,1928476,5.0,4.0,"Dornshuld is by far the best professor I have had at Mississippi State.  Chemistry is tough in general, but if you go to class and study, you will be prepared for the test.  GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS! He tells you pretty much exactly what will be on the exam!  I enjoy this class because he makes it interesting and is overall an amazing professor!"
2829,1928476,1.0,5.0,RUN AWAY! This professor is so hard. He teaches the class like its a review session. He goes to fast! He rushes almost everything. He doesn't address you as much when you need help. He doesn't give extra credit. He is very rude at times! If you are not willing to buckle down and learn do not take him. The only positive thing is that he can be funny
2830,1928476,4.0,2.0,"Ill shoot it to ya straight. Chem 1 and 2 are tough. However. IF you got to class, take notes, do the homework. There is NO reason you cant make a B. Erik constantly gives hints as to what is on the tests.  By far one of the easiest CHEM teachers at state.  He gives far less homework than others and gives you review sessions for the test. Take him!"
2831,1928476,4.0,3.0,"He's a good professor. He is reasonable and gos over class material at a decent pace. He is hilarious and I found his classes seemed shorter than most because of it. If you are a decent student, he's a good professor!"
2832,1928476,1.0,5.0,"he is HORRIBLE... failing the enter semester ! no matter how hard you study  ! test are based on concepts and not on math, which is what chemistry evolves around. you need your text book to read the chapters and know the conceptual side of things."
2833,1928476,3.0,4.0,"If you go to him he will clarify the topic. Otherwise, his class is as clear as mud."
2834,1928476,3.5,4.0,"Goes through material at fast pace, studying outside of class continuously throughout course is a must to keep up. If you have less than 3 unexcused absences you can drop your lowest test grade, which you will likely need."
2835,1928476,3.5,3.0,Good teacher easier than the other chemistry I professors
2836,1928476,4.0,4.0,"Chemistry is a hard subject to understand, and people often blame the professor for that, but honestly Dr. D is probably one of the best professors to have at MSU. He tells you what to expect on the exam, YOU just have to study. He cracks jokes through class, and his power points can be entertaining. Also, don't be afraid to ask him to slow down."
2837,1928476,4.0,4.0,"Although some of the presentations/lectures can be unclear, Dr. Dornshuld posts them online each day in order for students to review before and after his class. He's very funny, and some of his tests questions can be very entertaining to read, but you have to know what you're doing. He also drops a test grade if you miss less than 3 classes."
2838,1928476,3.5,3.0,"Dornshuld is given crap for being hard and fast-paced, but honestly he does what he can with the 50  minutes per class he has to use. Perhaps if you have absolutely no background in chemistry whatsoever, consider not taking, but otherwise you're fine. Overall a great teacher, would recommend"
2839,1928476,2.5,4.0,"He already assumes you know how to do everything so he treats every class like a review, but he is very specific about what he puts o the test and all you have to do is learn what he tells you to pass. "
2840,1928476,2.0,5.0,"Even if you are a passionate and dedicated student, Dr. Dornshuld treats his students like we all have a strong background of chemistry. This was very untrue for me and since he goes so fast in lecture sometimes covering 3 chapters of material in one week, I did not learn in his class and did not do well. Not everyone can be teacher's pet. "
2841,1928476,4.0,4.0,"Best Professor I have ever had! He challenges you and tests are tough if you don't study. Go to class and review sessions because he gives you hints for tests. Sit in the front row and get to know him. He  has the heart of a teacher so he's willing to help you. Go to office hours, tutoring sessions, and study EVERY day. And you'll be fine! "
2842,1928476,2.0,5.0,"Sit at the front of the class every day and get to know him, because otherwise, he wont listen to you and is really rude."
2843,1928476,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Dornshuld runs a difficult class, but he's not unreasonable.  He treats his students like adults and gives us all the tools we need to perform well on tests.  His class was a wakeup call to what college is like and what habits  I needed to start doing.  Most people in his class who complain have poor attendance and dont do the homework.   "
2844,1928476,2.0,5.0,"Dornshuld covers a lot of info way to fast.  His tests are extremely brutal and they are often too long to be able to finish within the 50 minute class period.  He expects his students to have way more previous knowledge than they do and when a few of the students understand what is going on, he believes that everyone else does, too  "
2845,1928476,3.5,5.0,"IT'S A HARD CLASS a lot of material is covered in a short amount of time, but he's not out to get you. There are review sessions, test hand outs, and all the powerpoint slides are online. He has office hours but will schedule time for you if you can't make them. I would recommend only taking his class if you have a basic chem understanding already."
2846,1928476,1.0,5.0,"He is a terrible teacher, only gives homework and tests, and the tests are brutal. You need to memorize the most obscure things just to pass. Our class got a 51 average on a test and he refused to scale it. If you need to take chemistry don't take dornshuld."
2847,1928476,1.0,5.0,"To put things into perspective, on the first test the class average was a 51, 300 out of 500 students failed, 11 got in the A range and since 1 student got a 100 the test wasn't scaled. The class is only graded based on homework and tests and tests are worth 85%. But he rarely takes attendance and going to class wont help you anyway"
2848,1928476,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Eric V. Dornshuld is probably the worst science instructor I have encountered in my 4 years of college. He is very unclear with his notes and is very fast paced. Dr. D. doesn't elaborate on the material at all. If you haven't had a Chemistry class in high school or any where else, you are OUT OF LUCK. He is the worst instructor for Chemistry. "
2849,2485536,1.0,5.0,Seems to be very unqualified as a teacher. Acts like he is trying to prove himself. DO NOT TAKE HIM AT ALL COST. 
2850,2485536,5.0,4.0,He is a really nice guy. Material is pretty hard though... If you go to class and do the homework it should help a bit but you definitely have to study!
2851,2485536,3.0,4.0,"Very good professor, just a hard class in general no matter who you take. For the most part, all I did was do the homework, study a decent amount of days before the tests, and studied hard for the finals. I came out with an A, and I would say that as long as you do your homework and give yourself time to study, you will be fine."
2852,2485536,3.0,4.0,"This class is hard with anyone you take. You just need to make sure that you understand the conceptual things just as much as you know how to do the math. This class consist of 5 exams including the non-optional final and homework. Show up to class everyday, and review the material the same night. Also get help from peers or the student assistant."
2853,552225,5.0,4.0,Dr. Dodds is an AMAZING professor. I almost swithced my major to english after taking her Inro to Sci-Fi class. Shes so smart and kind. Shes always available to help her students and she wants you to succeed. Her class is very lecture heavy and there are a lot of readings but if you want a relatively easy english class id suggest this one!
2854,552225,5.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. Dodds. She's so nice and understanding and is super helpful. The readings can be pretty confusing, but her lectures clear everything up really well. As long as you go to class and pay attention you'll be set. She's awesome, 10/10 recommend!"
2855,552225,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Dodds is one of the best English professors on MSU's campus. I went into her class thinking I was going to hate it, but she was such an amazing professor that it made me passionate about subjects I wasn't interested in before. There was a lot of reading, and a lot of discussion, but the discussions were the best and cleared up a lot."
2856,552225,5.0,2.0,"One of the best teachers that have taught me in the English Department. She is so willing to help out with research papers and her exams are fair. If you study and pay attention to class, youll be able to get an A. I would advice you to write everything down."
2857,552225,5.0,1.0,"I don't know where to begin on Lara Dodds.  I  had her twice in my undergraduate studies.  The first time I took her, I decided that I would never sigh up for one of her classes again, and then there I was.  To me, hearing her speak, hearing her opinions, and sitting in her classroom is like hearing art. Wish I had more characters.  Great teacher."
2858,552225,4.5,3.0,Had a great experience in this class & with Dr Dodds. She was very helpful and available outside of class. Note that we only covered 3 chapters from the textbook and even then went over most of the concepts in class; book not 100% necessary.
2859,552225,5.0,4.0,"She was a great teacher.  Definitely didn't show preference to any particular students over others.  She had high expectations for class discussion, but it is very engaging and makes class that much more interesting.  She always dresses like a hotty, too!"
2860,552225,5.0,3.0,Good teacher. The class was well organized. Certainly didn't notice any signs of favoritism.
2861,552225,4.0,4.0,"She was quite intimidating on first impression, but over the course of the semester i found her to be humorous and helpful in so many ways."
2862,552225,1.5,5.0,No Comments
2863,552225,3.0,4.0,"This teacher plays favorites.  Her class is extremely boring--I love English but she made me not want to attend class at all.  After working several hours on a final paper, I still received a B.  Don't take her unless you have a natural talent for writing. BTW, her students nicknamed her &quot;The devil&quot;"
2864,2420013,3.0,3.0,she isn't very clear about what she wants to be done and she uses mindtap and mindtap barely ever works. she gives a lot of what seems like busy work almost. the class is VERY highschool. she grades somewhat difficultly and its annoying bc her class feels like you're in the 10th grade. she's a very cool person her class just sucks.
2865,2551096,5.0,2.0,"She is great! I loved her class and thought it was fairly easy. Her essay prompts were never too hard and she always gave good feedback! As long as you make her corrections on essays, you will pass. She also gives lots of extra credit for just coming to class, enough to bump my grade up a letter. Love her!"
2866,2551096,4.0,3.0,"Go to class, in class only assignments and attendance matters. Lots of extra credit and gives you points just for going to class."
2867,2551096,4.0,2.0,"At first, I struggled to distinguish the criteria for essays and felt I was being graded extremely hard. Now, I have gotten great feedback and she has been much better at explaining criteria. She has assignments due in class only and sometimes gives extra credit. Overall, Professor Wolfe is a great professor and genuinely cares about her students."
2868,2551096,3.0,3.0,She's nice and helpful. Assignments are explained but not in detail. She never tells us what we were specifically trying to accomplish. If you have questions or need help she willing to do so.
2869,2551096,4.0,3.0,Ms. Wolfe is a wonderful Comp. 1 professor. The assignments are essays and revision activities. She tells you exactly what shes looking for and gives excellent feedback on your writing.
2870,2551096,1.0,1.0,I would not recommend this class. The problem is that there was little instruction for assignments. She would respond to emails saying she will go over it in class and then cancel the class. She does not follow the syllabus and will send passive-aggressive emails about class attendance when the syllabus says it is an online day. pick anyone else.
2871,2551096,4.0,3.0,Shes really nice. We dont meet in person that much and her class is pretty easy. Shes not a hard grader and is always accessible outside of class.
2872,2551096,5.0,3.0,"This class is mainly just writing papers the whole time, but I absolutely loved her. She is very kind and sweet and does everything in her power to make sure you understand the material and pass with a great grade. I recommend her to anyone coming into State taking English Comp 1. She is absolutely fantastic and an amazing instructor."
2873,2288957,5.0,1.0,Leslie was a great teacher to help with the transition to college. Her class was very straightforward and easy to pass as long as you follow her outlines for each essay.
2874,2288957,5.0,1.0,"Ms. Pevey is very straightforward about what she wants for her assignments. If you follow her directions, you're guaranteed to pass."
2875,2288957,5.0,2.0,"Great for Freshmen students to transition from high school. She is fun and very relatable to students. She gives a simple formula to do well on all her papers, just follow it and you can make an A easily."
2876,2288957,5.0,2.0,Best prof I have had has MSU yet! Super nice and funny. Show up to class and do what she says and you'll get an A. Anytime you need help she is more than willing.
2877,2288957,5.0,1.0,Great 1st Teacher. She Really Helps Students Grasp The Material And Is Very Understanding.
2878,2288957,5.0,1.0,"Leslie is an amazing English professor, even if you don't like English. She is young, cool, and understands that we have a life outside of our education. Super helpful if you go to her during office hours and an easy A if you just do what she says. Also gives extra credit for going to the writing center"
2879,707911,5.0,2.0,Incredible professor! One of the best that I've had.
2880,707911,5.0,3.0,Awesome.  Terrific Teacher.  Explains everything easily.
2881,707911,4.0,2.0,Oh so funny! He's a great guy that makes studying Meteorology fun.
2882,707911,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Wax was one of my favorite professors at MSU. His jokes are corny, but hilarious and he is an excellent professor with great knowledge. If you show you are making an effort in his class, he will do everything he can to ensure that you do well and understand. Take a class under him if you can!"
2883,707911,4.0,2.0,"If you attend and pay attention...take notes...you will be fine.  He won't give you your grade, but he does give u the info to earn it."
2884,2526545,3.0,3.0,"Good teacher, class most is taken for credit. He seems excited to teach us about everything, but is met with a class who doesn't care. A lot of group projects, easy assignments though. Tough daily quizzes, so you better be ready to study."
2885,2600285,1.0,3.0,Honestly the worst teacher I have ever had in my life. She waited until last minute to cancel class and when we had webex meetings you could tell she was just still in bed. Feedback on papers was always 3-4 hours before the essay was due and even when you corrected what she said to you never would make an A. Has too much pride to give A's.
2886,2600285,4.0,2.0,"Ms. Sheppard did great this semester being that we are in a pandemic. Yes, she did cancel class often, but most of the time it was a few hours before class or it was already planned except for the one time she didn't have keys to the class. She was very thorough on giving feedback for papers and definitely helped me see where I could improve."
2887,2600285,1.0,3.0,Horrible professor. Sheppard barely came to class this semester. She would always cancel at the last minute. She would take weeks to respond back to email. Assignments were graded late. She was not helpful at all. I would not recommend this professor.
2888,2600285,1.0,3.0,She never answered any of her emails and she canceled class at least once a week which itself is nice but she never went over what we would have learned leaving the class to just figure it out.
2889,2600285,4.0,2.0,"Ms. Sheppard is a solid choice. for Comp. She is very laid back, and class often got out early (after 20-30 minutes). She can sometimes be a bit aloof in her lectures, but she gives good feedback on work and she is available to help if needed. Comp Pro Tip: choose a topic that interests you. You will be writing basically the same paper 4-5 times."
2890,2084200,2.0,4.0,"Although Professor Lalk is a friendly person, she is not a good teacher. The lectures were a jumbled mess. The ""other topics to review"" is an unnecessary amount of work that does not even get tested on. The tests are overly difficult for no reason and are NOT what is in the lectures or books. I would not take this class again."
2891,2084200,4.0,1.0,"Took her Honors World Geo class. We had class scheduled for 3 days a week but 1 of those is online. Ill be honest her quizzes are quite easy, and almost everything is participation points. In her syllabus it states attendance does not contribute to grade, so I guess attend however you feel necessary. I would recommend her, she is quite fun."
2892,2084200,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Lalk is an incredibly kind and flexible professor, particularly with regards to COVID inconveniences. Her lectures can be a little scattered, but if you read over her powerpoints before class, they make much more sense. If you're struggling, it's because you aren't doing anything at all. I'd encourage participation, she notices and appreciates."
2893,2084200,2.0,4.0,"Shes a very nice lady, but I personally would not take her again. She does curve almost every test and rounds your grade up at the end. Besides her niceness she is a terrible teacher. No study guides and the test are nothing of the material she says it will be."
2894,2084200,5.0,2.0,"she was the best! she understands that most people just take her class since it is required, so its pretty easy and she CURVES BIG. i love her. she can tell who scans and leaves so be careful, but show up and take notes and you will be fine. she gave us candy on halloween and dressed up, it was great"
2895,2084200,4.0,3.0,"She wants you to pass and does not make anything too difficult. All the tests are take home and the short answers are not graded hard at all. Lectures are interesting, short, and to the point. Class was cancelled a lot and grades took a while to go in, but overall an easy, efficient honors class."
2896,2084200,2.0,1.0,"Dr. Lalk is an okay teacher. She cancelled class a lot, and she always seemed unprepared when we actually did have class. She's super passionate about geography, but she expects everyone else to be also. Her class is super easy, and she posts all the notes online."
2897,2084200,5.0,2.0,Dr. Lalk is a great professor. She tries to make lectures fun and she is really nice. For the honors section tests were take home and map quizzes were online. If you give forth effort you will have an A in this class. The discussions and in class lecturing brought back a high school feel for me. Going to miss this class. 10/10
2898,2084200,5.0,2.0,Dr. Lalk is amazing!! I would highly recommend her as a professor! She's very laid back and easy to talk to. She also tries to make class fun instead of boring. Map quizzes are online and very easy. All my tests were take-home and fairly short. Super easy final project. Dr. Lalk is a 10/10 teacher!!
2899,2084200,4.0,2.0,LOVED HER!!! I had her for Honors Intro to World Geo and she was amazing. Super easy going and all of our tests ended up being take home. She truly cares about each student getting something out of the class.
2900,2084200,2.0,1.0,"DO NOT TAKE HER!!! She is scatterbrained as all get out, cannot keep what she wants in an assignment from you straight, always changing due dates, and cancels class 80% of the time. This should have been an online class because i'm teaching myself anyway. HORRIBLE teacher. Take the online course taught by someone much more qualified."
2901,2084200,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Lalk is absolutely amazing, she encourages you to learn and focus on the parts of her class you enjoy and it largely consists of discussion and group learning on geopolitics. Oh, and there are food days!"
2902,2084200,2.0,3.0,"Not to difficult, keep up with the work and online lectures. Though the homework assignments were a lot, a good grade was achievable if you did the work. However, I had to notify her several times when she did not have an assignment posted and the tests are where most students bombed which she should dropped the midterm or allowed extra credit."
2903,2084200,5.0,3.0,"Loved her so much! This was an honors class, so I expected it to be more difficult than usual, but she made all the test take-home, uploaded her slides, and was really nice overall. I would definitely take her again. She is very sweet and funny."
2904,2084200,2.0,5.0,"Don't take this professor. First test was over a few hundred powerpoint slides with lots of info on each slide. Must study everything to be prepared for test. Simply too much to study. Additionally, she will not round your grade up. Find another professor who teaches Intro to World Geography."
2905,2084200,3.5,2.0,Puts all of the material online for the tests.  Also constructs study guides for you to base what you need to study off of. 
2906,1682793,5.0,1.0,I am still in her class. She is very helpful and just as nice as she can be. I would advise anyone to get in her class. She is a fantastic teacher and being nice makes the class even better.
2907,1682793,4.5,3.0,"Good teacher that is somewhat difficult. Gives extra points for visiting writing center and is very helpful. Sometimes seemed like she was unsure of things, but is ver nice."
2908,888180,4.0,3.0,"He is very passionate about what he teaches, I just didn't have very much interest in architecture. Some of the topics I really enjoyed, but it was a lot of information for an 8 am. Make sure to study ahead of time and pay some attention to his lectures, the Quizlets that were already made dont cover all the information. Skim the book for paper"
2909,888180,5.0,3.0,"Amazing prof. with a genuine interest in the class! Take another art credit if you dislike architecture. Tests are straight from lecture. Most students were freshmen who didn't show up (weed out class). Attend every lecture! If you miss a class, borrow notes/read textbook. Pictures are important too! Extra credit & papers to boost your grade."
2910,888180,5.0,2.0,He was very enthusiastic and excited about his lectures. He made something that could possibly be boring and made it entertaining for everyone. He had amazing one-liners as well! His passion for architecture really makes the class worth going to. I would recommend him 100 times over.
2911,888180,3.0,4.0,"His class is extremely boring and hard to pay attention in. The tests mostly come from the slides, but there are so many slides, and it is hard to engage and learn them because of how boring his class is. Not the easiest A, but it's definitely a passable class."
2912,888180,4.0,3.0,"Took him and his class thinking it would be an easy elective, Definitely had to do a lot of work though. So if you are looking for an easy elective he is not the guy. Boring class."
2913,888180,5.0,2.0,"I needed to get an art credit and this was the only class left. Well, I ended up loving it. Briar makes the class so interesting. He is so passionate about architecture. The material for his tests can be found on quizlet. Very easy. Take him!"
2914,888180,4.0,1.0,I took the online version of this class and it was not hard at all. most of the material was covered in the lectures.
2915,888180,2.0,4.0,I had a 91 then dropped down to a 79 bc I didnt submit my paper so plz do your paper as you can see its Crucial also its a easy class but his grading doesnt make sense. And a lot of work I barley heard from him this entire semester so be sure to be on the look out for his emails or else youll be behind.
2916,888180,3.0,4.0,"Passionate about what he teaches, but the class is boring if you don't like architecture. Take photos of the powerpoints. His tests are hard. They're multiple choice. This class was my most challenging of the semester, and it was my elective. The class has a book report, but you can get an A on it even if you just read sparknotes."
2917,888180,3.0,3.0,I found this class particularly boring and as the year went on I paid less and less attention. As long as you study the information that is highlighted on the powerpoints then you will be fine. Just make sure to write down the notes because they aren't posted online. Tests are sort of difficult but an A is attainable.
2918,888180,4.0,4.0,"I almost failed this course, but I went up to him and asked him I should improve my grade and he told me to do the extra credit and told me to take pictures of the PowerPoint and my grade went up to a C. I thought the class was really hard and boring, but you can tell he is passionate about architecture and he is willing to help"
2919,888180,5.0,2.0,"Good class, just have to go and take notes to study to get an A. Test are multiple choice and straight forward. Nice guy. Gives extra credit at end of the year. 4 tests and 3 papers. Overall not to much work for a class."
2920,888180,5.0,3.0,I signed up for the course as an elective and an easy A. What I got from it was much more. I never expected to be so interested in an elective course. His lectures keep you listening and entertained. If youre just in it for the easy A.. he highlights what will be on the test in his powerpoints. Tests are word for word off of the slides.
2921,888180,3.0,2.0,"pretty boring class, I slept through class a lot but there is a quizlet for his tests online"
2922,888180,3.0,4.0,"This class isn't awful, but he makes it difficult for just an elective. There is a book report and lots of papers. If you don't go to class/have a friend to get the notes... good luck. He doesn't post the notes anywhere. He honestly just takes the class a little to seriously, so if ur looking for an easy A, don't take it. He does offer extra credit"
2923,888180,3.0,1.0,He is a good guy for sure. His class is pretty boring but it's not hard. Just study all of the notes and you should be fine.
2924,888180,4.0,2.0,"Interesting guy, easy class. He really is passionate about architecture, and even though I only took his class as an elective, I learned some interesting things! He gives several extra credit opportunities and highlights all important info on his slides. As long as you show up, get the notes, and study a few hours for each test, it's an easy A!"
2925,888180,5.0,1.0,Great guy and professor. Makes a seemingly boring class very interesting
2926,888180,3.5,2.0,Def. easy. Show up on time for the test. Take notes on the power points. Dont talk. You'll have it made.
2927,888180,4.5,1.0,"He teaches by using powerpoints, and they are pretty interesting. The day of the test, he reveiws EXACTLY what is on the tests IN ORDER.  So if you show up early on test day and listen, you have an A in the bag.  He speaks loud and clearly (the class is in a large auditorium).  Just SHOW UP EARLY ON TEST DAY, if youre late, he wont let you in."
2928,2100598,4.0,4.0,"I had Mr. Jones for Architecture Appreciation, and he is a great teacher and is passionate about his job. However, unless you are very interested in architecture (I thought I was, I even almost majored in architecture), I wouldn't take this class. You have to write a TON of notes and study a ton because the tests are almost completely memorization."
2929,2100598,2.0,2.0,"Mr. Jones is a nice person. Sometimes his lectures can be a little boring. My biggest piece of advice is to attend class regularly, if not you will not get the materials. He also offers extra credit."
2930,2100598,3.0,2.0,"The class is very boring but he's a pretty nice guy, just never stops talking. He makes it clear what's on the test it's not hard it's just a lot of information. He offers an extra credit paper DO IT!! It's super easy and it's 5 points on your final grade."
2931,2100598,3.0,3.0,"Lectures aren't super entertaining. He also tends to rush so you may not catch all of the notes ( he encourages you to take pictures of the notes though). Required us to read Ayn Rand for an architecture class, do with that info what you will. I didn't use textbook, he offers extra cred, &amp; notes can be found on quizlet. Easy class if you get notes."
2932,2100598,5.0,2.0,"He's great. He is very clear with what he wants on tests. There are also too many quizlets, attendance does not count which is awesome. He is so fast to get your grades back. The only problem is but they are not online. If you keep up with your grades you are fine."
2933,2100598,2.0,3.0,you will not know your grade until the very end of the semester but going to class is unnecessary as all of the notes for the tests are easily found on quizlet. Easy teacher but not interesting at all.
2934,2100598,4.0,2.0,"If you miss this class you can usually find all the notes on a quizlet but he is late to put in homework grades so you won't know your true average until the end of the semester. Tests consist of things in the lecture. They're about 35 questions, not that hard."
2935,2149752,5.0,4.0,Dr. Boyce is a very good teacher and is very passionate about the course material. She really cares about her students and their success but it is graded heavily on attendance. There is a lot of reading but I would recommend anyone taking the quest to take Dr. Boyce.
2936,2149752,5.0,3.0,her effort to make classes interesting and thought-provoking in the midst of the pandemic is astounding
2937,2149752,5.0,4.0,"I had Dr. Boyce for Quest II, and she was awesome. She is so passionate about the course, and it makes it so much more interesting for students. She'll assign a number of readings that you'll discuss in class, on a discussion board in Canvas, and in papers. You need to do the readings- she asks direct questions to students in discussions."
2938,2149752,3.0,2.0,Online textbook is very expensive but it is the only source for good notes because she doesn't write any on the board. She is good at explaining if you get stuck. There is some group work but it is only done for extra points. She lets you have a notecard on the test because Logic is difficult to memorize.
2939,2149752,1.0,1.0,"This is class is the most boring class ever. Material isn't super hard and the tests are pretty easy, but she makes it nearly impossible to learn because her teaching style is awful. She is a little weird but she is really super nice and gives extra credit and will help you get a A. Just SUPER boring"
2940,2149752,1.0,4.0,BORING LECTURES YOU WILL DREAD IT
2941,2149752,4.0,4.0,"This is a tough course.  The material is difficult to understand and even more difficult to explain.  Dr. Boyce provides several practice problems and lets you bring a cheat sheet to tests, but they are still difficult because of the proofs.  If you have to take this class, Dr. Boyce is a good choice but do not take it as an elective."
2942,2100600,4.0,1.0,"Dr. Singh was an amazing professor. I typically find geography extremely boring, but he made the class interesting and not too difficult."
2943,2100600,4.0,1.0,Great instructor for this course. Good balance of humor and seriousness
2944,2100600,4.0,2.0,"thick indian accent and a great sense of humor. he helped me out a lot when i forgot to do some quizzes. reopened them for me and wasn't even mad! gives study guides for tests that come straight from his powerpoints, but he won't put them online so take notes!"
2945,2100600,2.0,4.0,"If you like hard tests that aren't like the lectures, and thick accents, Singh is the man for you"
2946,2100600,1.0,4.0,"Very hard to understand, tests are not anything like the lectures, and the study guides he gives out are useless. There are a couple of map quizzes which are super easy and they bump your grade up a little from all of the difficult tests. I would not recommend this professor to anyone."
2947,1641852,1.5,5.0,"No study guides for test. ""Study the chapter"" is about all the help you will receive. Seems like a nice person, but the class was terrible. Strictly went over lessons in the book &nothing else. Never really explained anything."
2948,1641852,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher! Explains well and she's very nice! The tests are a bit hard, but they're the same across Spanish 2 classes, so not her fault."
2949,1641852,2.0,5.0,She does not believe in drop grades or extra credit. I have a 3.87 for 49 hours worth of classes so I'm relatively intelligent but her class made me feel stupid. I barely came out with an 82. I spent hours on homework but none was graded until the end of the semester. Do NOT take her!
2950,1641852,5.0,3.0,"She's extremely helpful, and a very nice teacher! I would definitely recommend her!"
2951,2575751,1.0,4.0,"She's nice but hard to understand. We had a lab report, but she didn't tell us what she wanted specifically. we got out grades back and she counted off for stuff she didn't even specify. she doesn't teach you how to do anything either, so watch youtube videos if you do not know how to do PCR, use micropipettes, etc. She is just very scatter brained"
2952,2198936,4.0,3.0,"I fundamentally hate statistics and find it horridly boring, but she made this course bearable and not a complete drag, which says a lot. Her lectures are straightforward and easy to follow along with, and her tests are all perfectly fair. There's a lot of homework, several quizzes, and like 5 exams plus a final, but do take her if you have to."
2953,2198936,4.0,2.0,"Class is easy if you are good at math. The material is sometimes boring, but is repetitive so it's easy to understand. Homework can take some time, so don't wait til the last minute. Has guided notes that are very easy to follow. Overall she is a good teacher. "
2954,2198936,5.0,5.0,"Shes very nice. The class was somewhat difficult, but she was very helpful. Class was supposed to be 2 hours, but never went past an hour and 15 min. She allowed students to stay and shed help them. Homework and quiz due every week online. Tests were all on paper and shed give some credit for wrong answers if she saw effort."
2955,2198936,4.0,3.0,Professor Beckman is a good teacher.  I really like how she teaches.  Her homework helps and prepares you for the test.  The class was not hard.  She is very sweet too and will answer questions that you have happily.  
2956,2198936,4.0,3.0,"This class was easy, but very tricky. She is the only professor for this course. There are a lot of HW and practice quizzes that are very tedious. It is crazy to me that this is a Junior level course and yet Calculus courses are not but way more challenging."
2957,2198936,3.0,3.0,"The notes were fill in the blank, and she worked through them thoroughly. She always stopped to ask questions, and was very happy to help. There was a lot of homework, and sometimes it was due the night of the test. Overall, she was a fair teacher."
2958,2198936,4.0,2.0,Good bit of homework and quizzes but you get multiple chances on them and questions are all very similar to in class examples. Tests are fair and the questions are also very similar to example and homework questions. The lectures were very clearly organized but a bit boring. Attendance not mandatory but helpful. Shes nice but slow moving class
2959,2198936,5.0,4.0,Her notes are all fill in the blank and well organized. She is very helpful and has a review day before each test. The time allotted for our class was 1:50-3:35 but we were always out around 3. Sometimes the lectures get kinda boring but that could just be me. The quizzes and homework make you well prepared for the exams!
2960,2198936,1.0,4.0,"This class was suppose to be an easy class to take as an engineering student because I was loaded with other much harder classes. This teacher is so rude, she has not responded to my emails, she does not care about her students and she will let you fail. I would never take her class again."
2961,2198936,5.0,3.0,"Genuinely wants students to succeed. Will email back very quickly, even on weekends. During fall 2020, she posted pre recorded lectures in addition to live streaming the class that was face-to-face. A relatively difficult class, but she teaches very thoroughly and the tests are not anything she did not say would be there. Lecture always ends early."
2962,2198936,4.0,3.0,"Her notes are fill in the blank, and the test are very similar to the homework, quizzes, and problems in the notes. My class was an hour 15 and we were in there at most 50 minutes. Will help you out if you reach out to her. Very nice!"
2963,2198936,2.0,2.0,"She is a good and willing teacher, but her style of teaching does not work for me. I was not able to absorb anything she was saying because she goes too fast. The notes are fill in the blank, which is nice but also terrible if youre trying to learn. She just reads the notes to you basically."
2964,2198936,5.0,2.0,"She explains everything clearly and has notes you print out and work out with her. Homework follows the notes and is 20% of your grade. Quizzes come from homework questions. Tests can be tricky, but still use the processes she teaches in class. Beware of the true/false. Tests aren't a huge portion of the grade, though."
2965,2198936,4.0,3.0,"There are a lot of assignments, but they're pretty easy. If you sit down and write out each problem by steps, the class is a breeze. She is really easy to access via email or office hours. Her notes are fill in the blank, work-out style. I recommend ordering all the notes to be printed through office max into a notebook for $20! Labs are in class."
2966,2198936,5.0,3.0,Had her for intro to stats and she was great! Lectures were fill-in the blanks notes and very straightforward. On average class was only 1 hour long out of 1:45 allotted which was nice. Online Hw/Quizzes arent hard just can take awhile. Overall a pretty easy and straightforward class.
2967,2198936,3.0,2.0,"I took this class online, and don't make the same mistake I did. She is a really good professor, but the online system always glitched during tests. It kicked me out early during several of my tests causing me to have a lower grade in the class. Definitely take it in person and not online. I would've had a lot fewer headaches had I known this."
2968,2198936,5.0,4.0,"You HAVE to go to class to get the notes and you get a replacement/drop test depending on attendance. She is an awesome teacher and knows what she is teaching. She is always willing to help and will literally do the lab (only 3 total) in class in front of you, so if you follow along with her you have 3 easy 100's. She is there to help and I loved!"
2969,2198936,1.0,2.0,"Don't bother reading the syllabus, she won't stick to it. She says attendance is optional, but she will change dates for assignments AND TESTS in class with no online notification, and with no chance of fixing it later. The material is easy, but she expects you to listen to her drone for the entire class and will refuse any form of help if you miss"
2970,2198936,2.0,2.0,"Ms. Beckman tended to teach for the test. We were not informed on what most of the formulas actually mean, and many questions seemed to throw her off track. We were usually taught how to plug formulas into a calculator, rather than how to reason about statistics. However, was it any easy A? Yes."
2971,2198936,3.0,3.0,"If you miss less than three classes, you get five or so bonus points on your lowest test. If you do the homework, you're fine. She also doesn't skip steps while explaining a problem."
2972,2198936,1.0,3.0,This professor doesn't care if you're struggling and does little to help struggling students. She seems to have little empathy for those of us who are not mathematically inclined. She orates for 1 hour without giving students time to absorb information and learn the things she's speeding through. I generally do well in math given a good teacher.
2973,2198936,5.0,3.0,"A nice means of filling out that much-needed Trigonometry credit.  Her lecture WILL. NEVER. RUN OVER.   She always sticks to her syllabus, and doesn't have to skim through or skip anything.  Beware, she teaches in a tone similar to that one awesome elementary teacher you knew, and will lull you to sleep on easier units.  Come woke."
2974,1838489,4.0,2.0,"The course was completely online, but Dr. B sounded like a nice person. Lectures were a bit long, but all you needed to know for tests and quizzes were given to you. Easy class overall and very informational."
2975,1838489,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Babineaux seems to be pretty nice. I had her for an online class so I never actually interacted with her, but from what it seems she is a good professor. She's very passionate about geology and her assignments are relatively easy. I'd recommend her for online."
2976,1838489,5.0,2.0,"So very kind especially when you take the time to get to know her. She can be tough and is strict on no talking in class, but she will definitely work with you. As long as you turn in assignments, you should get a good grade."
2977,1838489,4.0,1.0,"Only grades are online quizzes which are extremely easy, and tests. The tests are pretty much given in the study guide provided online. Gave random extra credit in class if class attendance was low."
2978,1838489,4.0,1.0,"If you show up and answer questions, you will get an A. She really liked me because I engaged in class and answered questions. Her tests come directly from powerpoints. She is excellent at covering what will be on tests, and there is virtually no homework. I studied the night before on every test and walked out with a 98. Too easy."
2979,1838489,2.0,3.0,Where do I start? she acts different each day-will not tolerate even a whisper in the back. Will single you out to humiliate by asking rapid fire questions until you nod enough-Never happened to me but Ive seen it done several times this semester. Although she has her favorites; mostly sorority girls who answer every question-Proceed with caution
2980,1838489,5.0,2.0,"Do you're map quizzes. Those will make or break you. It will take you like 10 minutes to do, not hard. Tests are fairly easy but you'll need to study a bit. Lectures can be boring, but she's pretty interactive with us. She's really cool."
2981,1838489,4.0,3.0,"She's very passionate about her work which is a plus for me. She does put a LOT of notes in her power points, but she also posts them online. Sometimes when a good number of people skip class, she'll give everyone present bonus points on the tests, which aren't that hard to begin with. She can be a stickler sometimes, but overall she's cool."
2982,1838489,4.0,3.0,"She really cares about her students. If you pay attention to her lectures, the tests arent too hard."
2983,1838489,4.0,3.0,"Dr. B was a great teacher! Very passionate about what she teaches. You have a few homework assignments but they are easy. As long as you moderately listen in the lecture and study the slides, you can pass this class. She's big on getting volunteers to demonstrate something. Also, definitely do not be on your phone in this class, she hates that."
2984,1838489,4.0,1.0,Wonderful teacher
2985,1838489,5.0,2.0,"Ms. B was an amazing professor! She was so very sweet and intellectual. She really enjoys rocks and everything dealing with the earth, and it shows. I definitely believe a professor should love what they are teaching to give the best knowledge possible, Ms. B nailed that! If I hadn't graduated and needed another physical science, i would choose her"
2986,1838489,4.0,2.0,"Ms. B was one of my favorite professors this semester, and I will definitely take another one of her classes if I have the opportunity.  One of the things that I like about her is that she likes to relate what is being taught with everyday things that people can relate to, which I find to be really helpful."
2987,1838489,4.0,3.0,I enjoyed her class.  I learned a lot and ended up with a good grade.  I had her back in 2010 when she was just starting out.  I've sat in on a few lectures since then and if I needed another physical science I'd definitely look for something she was teaching.
2988,1838489,4.0,2.0,I really like her class. She asks bunches of questions to see where we are but then explains well.Expects participation!!!. exams and quiz are from lecture. She posts study guides but leaves stuff out to make us study. She is very helpful if you have questions or issue. I recommend her if you are interested in learning about geology and work hard.
2989,1838489,3.5,2.0,"Ms. Babineaux is an interesting teacher. She tends to ask us lots of questions, kinda to see where we stand with the topic but then explains it. Exams and quiz are straight from lectures. she posts study guides but purposely leaves stuff out to make us study. I'd recommend her to anyone who likes to work and enjoys science."
2990,1838489,3.5,3.0,Ms. Babineaux is an interesting teacher. She asks us alot of questions to kinda feel out where we stand on a topic and to make us think it thru. Exams are straight from the lectures. Quizzes are too. She posts study guides but purposely leaves stuff out to make us go to lecture notes. Helps me study. I'd recommend her to those who like to work.
2991,1838489,2.5,3.0,Basically she's rude and expects you to already know everything before she even teaches it. This is a freshman level class that has no prerequisite but she gets mad when you don't know the answers to questions when you haven't been taught the material. She sends out study guides but they are no help on tests. Take someone else if you can!
2992,1838489,5.0,2.0,If you're taking this class try to get in the smaller section. She's is very helpful to our 9:30 class that has 40 students but she talks down her 11:00 that's has about 100. Teaches off powerpoints and explains well. tests are right off the study guide and many bonus points available. As long as you come to class and pay attention you will do well
2993,1838489,2.5,2.0,Ms. Babineaux is a very inconsisent and rude teacher. She flies through her power point and expects us to know the answers to things already. She'll ask questions and get mad when no one answers or gives a wrong answer. Is very inconsiderate to students.
2994,642457,5.0,4.0,"Dr Sebba is by far my favorite professor at Mississippi State. If you can attend class on time and try your hardest in her class, she becomes the most lighthearted, hilarious, and brilliant persona to be around. She is very knowledgeable in her subject and relies on teaching student quick tricks to speed up processes."
2995,642457,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Sebba is in some regards your first look into the real music profession.  Her class is at the ass crack of dawn, and you will certainly have to apply yourself.  But, the lessons she teaches will stay with you for the rest of your career, and she truly does want you to succeed."
2996,642457,5.0,4.0,Will definitely go down as one of my favorite professors. You will have to work for your grade but she'll help you any way she can. She really cares for all of her students.
2997,642457,4.5,4.0,If you dont study or dont pay close attention you won't do well. But it's not because of her teaching. Music theory is not an easy subject. But she is a great teacher and if you focus on learning the content you'll do fine. Has an accent but it shouldnt hinder your understanding. Grades work and submits your grade online within hours of submission.
2998,642457,5.0,5.0,I miss Dr. Sebba a lot. I hope she is coming next semester.
2999,642457,5.0,4.0,A great teacher who has great illustrations. She cares. Your not just a number in her studio and she goes out of her way to help.
3000,642457,5.0,5.0,Great teaching! Very difficult subect but makes it easy to understand
3001,642457,2.0,3.0,No Comments
3002,1641889,1.0,1.0,"suzanne is all over the place. she can't seem to stay on top of the schedule or assignments. she gives really loud critics and isn't available outside of class. she posts office hours but is never there. her crits are inconsistent at best. super easy though. show up, nod, and get an a."
3003,1641889,1.0,1.0,she cant seem to control the volume of her voice. yells all the time. scatter-brained
3004,1641889,1.0,1.0,powney is disorganized and sloppy. she is never prepared and doesn't grade anything on time. she doesn't seem to know a lot about design. she shows a lot of instagram images and google searches for inspiration instead of teaching us how to think and do on our own. wouldn't take her again.
3005,1641889,4.0,1.0,"She is very enthusiastic about graphic design and her student's projects. Do not expect to be babied in this class though. Sometimes he instructions are a little vague and you have to interpret them how you see fit. Easy grader for the most part. She is a little spacey sometimes, so don't be offended if she doesn't remember your name."
3006,1641889,4.5,3.0,"She has always been one of my favorites. Don't come into class with an attitude & she'll love you too. She does try to keep things relaxed & enjoyable.  She's great for bouncing ideas off of. Her ideas might seem strange, but if you humor her a bit, it may help you push your projects into a more interesting direction."
3007,1641889,2.0,5.0,"You'll always get feed back, (sometimes good) but can be extremely catty and negative in the processes. Sometimes is unpredictable and wishy-washy with critique.  Not an evil teacher, but hard to deal with for a whole semester and can leave you feeling very discouraged."
3008,1641889,1.0,4.0,"Very unorganized and unprofessional. Pretty creepy, too. Often inappropriate, loud, and disrespectful. Avoid her, if at all possible."
3009,2567586,1.0,4.0,You cannot understand him and he tells you to hurry all class when no one asks questions. He just talks to himself and it's gonna be a difficult semester. Doesn't communicate important information about the class either.
3010,2026932,4.0,4.0,"This is a professor that is very intelligent, but desperate to make sure his students understand. His tests are not memorization and a true test of whether you have the knowledge that he taught and able to apply it to situation, which makes them difficult."
3011,2026932,3.0,3.0,"I enjoyed his lecture, but his tests are pretty challenging."
3012,2026932,4.0,4.0,"Amazing teacher. Really cares that you understand what he is talking about. You HAVE TO STUDY though to pass a test. They are application based, not memorization!"
3013,2026932,4.0,4.0,He is caring. Wants to make sure you understand. Replies quickly to emails. Wants to help you.
3014,2026932,5.0,3.0,I have had him for several classes.  He is a great teacher and gives great examples.  You do have to study to pass the tests.  He wants you to know the information.  My favorite professor.
3015,2026932,4.0,2.0,"He is great teacher. The test are STRAIGHT from the notes. It requires studying but as long as you study, you will pass.  He gives extra credit on certain days just for being there when most of the class isn't there, and is available for office hours at any time. I'd recommend him for any class. "
3016,2026932,4.0,2.0,He gives great examples during lectures and will work with you on extra assignments and quizzes to boost your grade.
3017,1445303,5.0,3.0,"Research Practice should be boring; with Lane, no way. Brought it... Everyday, and even when discussing statistics still made me laugh... The Best, Love you Dr. Lane"
3018,1445303,4.5,3.0,"She is so funny, some times I would go when I was down just so she could make me laugh. What I love about her most is that she really cares about students at MSU, she attends events, is often seen on campus and is so friendly. Loves MSU and it shows!!"
3019,1445303,4.5,3.0,Dr. Lane is fun and really great when it comes to helping students
3020,1445303,5.0,3.0,"Race and Ethnicity is a required course for several majors, take it with Dr. Lane !!! Honest, Funny, gets you to think about things in a different way... Class discussion and debate was my favorite part.... Hated missing this class...."
3021,1445303,4.5,2.0,"Great Prof, gives extra credit just to get students involved on campus in issues of diversity. Wants everyone to do well and it shows. Test can be a bit tricky, but she makes up for it with extra credit options."
3022,1445303,4.5,3.0,One of the best Professors I have had at MSU!!
3023,2510284,4.0,2.0,"Professor Jutong Wen, or Henry, as he would want you to call him, is a really good professor. He knows exactly what he is talking about. The only thing about this class was it was VERY long &amp; he lectured the whole time. He continuously repeated &amp; re-explained the same stuff over and over again, no matter how simple. Class material is on PowerPoint"
3024,1175004,5.0,2.0,She is full of energy and makes class very interactive. She teaches well and has a lot of activities to help understand concepts. She always gives a heads up about quizzes and homework due.
3025,1175004,5.0,3.0,"Señora Moya is a fantastic teacher! She was always very willing to help, and she truly tried to make sure we understood and retained the material. Im actually taking her class for Spanish II next semester."
3026,1175004,4.0,3.0,She is the sweetest human every!!  If you actually pay attention and go to class the class is a breeze.  I would take her again!
3027,1175004,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher all around. Very funny. Makes class worth going to. Attendance is part of the grade. Gives study guides for test, which is always a plus!"
3028,1175004,5.0,2.0,super nice! class is pretty easy!!
3029,1175004,4.5,1.0,"She is a great teacher!! Very easy and understanding. She will definitely work with you. My grandma past and my grades dropped relatively low, but she still helped me. She is beyond awesome:)"
3030,1175004,4.5,2.0,Good teacher.
3031,1175004,3.5,4.0,No Comments
3032,2584042,5.0,3.0,"I'm getting an engineering degree and took him for my first semester of freshman year. He is still one of my favorite professors and is clearly well read. Overall, we were graded on two assignments that were discussed heavily in class. Don't, and I mean don't, skip his class. Not once. You'll miss out on a great time and a great professor. "
3033,1781237,5.0,1.0,Mrs. Thornton was a remarkable teacher. Made it to the whole class understood her lectures always willing to help us with any problems we had. She makes going to class fun and she makes class interesting to see you keep coming back. Hands down get Amanda Thornton in for psychology.
3034,503305,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Goodman is an interesting man. He is very unorganized and fails to fully teach us material. He tends to talk about things that are not very related to the class. He is an extremely tough grader and does not tell you what he wants, making it much more difficult. The class is basically made up of papers and rambling."
3035,503305,1.0,4.0,"When I did poorly on the first two papers (this whole class is papers) I emailed him for help. He told me that I should probably leave the class because he did not think I was capable of writing an A paper, and if that was what I wanted I should leave. I have a 3.8 GPA as a junior in a writing major. He clearly does not care about his students. Run"
3036,503305,1.5,4.0,"The epitome of Ph.d does not mean good teacher. Expects you to read wiki to learn material and random notes. Beware:does not use university website or email and places blame on student for lost assignments, very unprofessional. Rude in emails (I'm a ph.d!). Mediocre grammar skills for a 'writer'. "
3037,503305,1.5,5.0,He treats this class as if it requires no teaching on his part. Very little explanation or expectation when assignments are given but grades as if the guideline were obvious. Teaching approach is lazy  for the level of work demanded and intense grading. Very unprofessional.
3038,503305,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Goodman's Mass Media Law class has been a great experience. He really makes you think and we have great discussions every class period. If you're not willing to think, don't take this class. There's an assignment due every class period (which gets kind of old), but it's still a good class. There's no memorization - just thinking and reasoning."
3039,503305,5.0,4.0,He's fun and funny and knows his stuff. He likes discussion and grades very hard. I liked the class alot and feel like I am better at it after the class.

3041,1805848,4.0,2.0,"The test are online and have nothing to do at all with what she teaches in class. Most of the class time is about her childhood stories. The test are not a joke though, make sure you know the chapters forwards and backwards."
3042,1805851,5.0,3.0,Mr. Montgomery is one of the best instructors Ive had! You can tell he cares about the students and loves the material he teaches. He gives plenty of reminders about assignment due dates and test days.
3043,1805851,5.0,2.0,Mr. Montgomery truly does care about his students and the material he teaches. This is present with the way he engages the class and tries to make the material fun with short little videos and speakers in class. He is also very consistent with due dates and test days and always gave plenty of notices before tests &amp; HW.
3044,1805851,5.0,2.0,"He really cares about his students. He had surgery and couldn't attend class in person, but he was very clear on dates for assignments and made sure to record all of the lectures ahead of time. Very understanding. I enjoyed his material and his tests and quizzes are not difficult if you attend the lectures and read the chapter."
3045,1805851,5.0,2.0,"I would take him for every class if I could. He keeps the class engaged and interested in the information by telling jokes and being animated. You do have to attend class to access the notes and the textbook is needed for the quizzes (there are 10). You have to study the information to get an A on the tests, but not too much. A WONDERFUL PERSON"
3046,1805851,5.0,1.0,"The book is barely used. Show up, take notes, study and you will get an A/"
3047,1805851,5.0,2.0,By far the best professor I have taken at State. He makes every lecture interesting and relatable. He genuinely cares about his students grades and his understanding if the student lets him know their situation. 10/10 recommend!!
3048,1805851,5.0,2.0,"One of the best teachers at State. In all of his classes he makes you think outside the box. Attendance is mandatory and the book is online thanks to canvas now. Bert loves to get to know his students, it's a shame he's not a full-time teacher because he would be phenomenal for upper level courses for sociology and religion."
3049,1805851,4.0,2.0,Very easy class and he gives lots of extra credit
3050,1805851,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Montgomery is a very easy professor. However, he presents very controversial, sensitive subjects in a manner that at times is inappropriate. Tests are fairly easy, and there are lots of online quizzes. He gives lots of extra credit opportunities."
3051,1805851,5.0,2.0,"Easily one of my favorite professors! Super caring and invested in his students, and his class is very easy. Attendance is taken for a test grade at the end, so as long as you show up and take notes you'll do fine on the tests and quizzes. He also gives numerous extra credit opportunities which can really help."
3052,1805851,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor. Attendance is required but the lectures are very interesting. Relates his lectures to life experiences. Not a hard class. Pay attention and you will get an A.
3053,1805851,5.0,4.0,My favorite professor at State! I'm not even in his department but have taken him for numerous elective classes.
3054,1805851,5.0,1.0,The best professor I have had and the class I looked forward to every week. Highly recommend any class taught by him!
3055,1805851,5.0,4.0,My favorite professor at State!! Loved him even with him being tough on a test. I took him for as many classes as I could even though it was electives. I liked him that much! He makes classes fun!
3056,1805851,5.0,1.0,LEGIT THE BEST PROFESSOR AT THIS SCHOOL
3057,1805851,5.0,3.0,"I took two classes with him, and loved having him!"
3058,1805851,5.0,1.0,"Robert was an AMAZING sociology professor. He was able to teach without coming across as hateful towards people of different political viewpoints. He is very kind and cares about his students. His tests are easy as long as you study your notes. If I could have him as a professor for more classes, I would take him in a heartbeat."
3059,1805851,5.0,1.0,"If you read this review to take him class, you are already late. TAKE THIS EASIEST COURSE IN MSU EVER! You only have three extra credit events, super easy four tests and attendance credit. That's all you need for A grade."
3060,1805851,5.0,1.0,"His class is super easy and the test are the same way. He is a Baptist Preacher outside of school too. He provides extra credit opportunities and you really don't need the book if you can copy the definition to study from a friend in class. Really, you don't need the book for his class (IF YOU CAN COPY THE VOCAB.!!) But yeah, go for it."
3061,1805853,5.0,1.0,I loved having Baker for Gender Studies! She's a great professor and inspiring as well.
3062,1805853,5.0,1.0,"Prof Baker is super nice and always willing to help. I had her for intro to gender studies. This is somewhat of an ""easy A"" class but I found it really interesting and learned a lot. There are lots of class discussions and activities. Take her if you get the chance!"
3063,1805853,4.0,2.0,"Okay, so I have her for Marriage and Family and OH MY GOODNESS! >:O For one thing, if your more than 5 minutes late to class SHE WILL CALL YOU OUT. If you fall asleep, SHE WILL CALL YOU OUT. We take weekly quizzes on top of the other weekly quizzes we have to do online. Test are okay if you study but I don't know of anyone in class that likes her."
3064,2453022,4.0,2.0,"I think Moorhead is a very good instructor for Digital Devices. She has experience in industry with digital design and a lot of research focuses on it too. Needless to say, she understands the material very well and really focuses on what's important to get you a job. Rework the Zybook problems and ICQs and you will make an A."
3065,2453022,5.0,3.0,Great women! very nice. Very caring. I had ended up in the hospital and I got knocked by a few weeks and she let me make up everything over time. Great person! Get ready to notes! She relies heavy on a website calls Zybooks which is very helpful in getting information. Highly recommends!
3066,2453022,2.0,4.0,"Mrs. Moorhead is a little hard to follow in lecture, but the homework and labs both help significantly as they are largely based on application of the concepts she was trying to explain. The tests are similar to the homework, so that does make it easier to pass the class than would be expected."
3067,2190888,2.0,4.0,"This professor does not communicate well. Throughout her class, I had roughly six assignments a week for her class including discussion boards, connect assignments, group work, and other homework. If you are planning on taking this class with her, take it multiple times a week/take it with difficult classes. "
3068,2190888,5.0,2.0,"Shes super nice and her class is pretty easy. the connect assignments are way too long, but she cant control that. I am deathly afraid of public speaking, but she made an environment where I wasn't as afraid. I hate group work, so that was the only thing i disliked. her classes fill up fast so sign up early. shes a great person "
3069,2190888,5.0,1.0,"She is such a loving and funny teacher. I took her class Monday nights 5-7pm and we never stayed past 6. She grades super easy, as long as you try. She understands public speaking/ communications/ speeches are scary and she is lenient on grading. She is so funny and tells many stories. TAKE HER SHE IS THE BEST."
3070,2190888,4.0,2.0,"Good teacher!! Lots of speeches, but that's really just the point of the class. She graded easily as long as you follow directions and put in effort. The tests were easy and open book. She's really funny and likes to get to know her students. "
3071,2190888,1.0,1.0,"For a communications professor, she is terrible at communicating with her students. She put the wrong time for a meeting on canvas. After emailing her five times, she finally replied and gave me credit, but now wont answer any of my other questions about grades she was supposed to put in but hasnt. Shes nice, but she needs to get it together."
3072,2190888,5.0,1.0,shes a phenomenal teacher 10/10 take. super kind and caring she genuinely cares about each of her students
3073,2190888,4.0,1.0,"Took her for Intro to Communication, class was super easy. Most of the grades are presenting speeches, which I hated but they were graded pretty liberally. As long as you presented something and it aligned with the topic you get a passing grade. Textbook purchase was necessary as homework and tests are done through the textbook website."
3074,2190888,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Harmon is the sweetest teacher ever, and makes class so enjoyable. Overall, she grades very fair but loves group work. You should definitely try NOT to skip this class because she makes important announcements during class times, and schedules speeches/order of speeches given during class."
3075,2190888,2.0,3.0,I have mixed feelings about her The class is interesting but when we went online she gave us a lot of busy work!! The study guide didn't prepare me for the test.
3076,2190888,5.0,2.0,She is a very sweet lady. The class itself is overall very easy as long as you pay attention. I highly recommend this class if you have a fear of speeches. She is very good about setting a relaxing atmosphere.
3077,2190888,4.0,1.0,"Had her for intro to communications and it was very easy. She sends out a study outline for the midterm and final. She also recommends that you use the quilzlets that past students made. There were 3 speeches (get to know you, group project, and informative)."
3078,2190888,4.0,2.0,"Intro to Communication with Nicole Harmon is an easy class. A majority of your grade comes from your speeches, but there are three tests. The tests are mostly the vocabulary in the book, so I'd suggest getting the book and making a quizlet to study. She gives study guides for the tests but they're vague. All in all, a pretty easy A."
3079,2190888,5.0,1.0,"She is absolutely great! She cares and she makes it as interesting as possible. Its and easy class to go to because it is in fact easy. She grades easily, and she makes presentations as comfortable as possible. She genuinely wants you to do well. She's decently young and relatable"
3080,2190888,5.0,2.0,One of the best teachers at MSU. Really enjoyed her class!
3081,1281604,5.0,3.0,I LOVE MCTHOMAS!!!!
3082,1281604,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, as long as you take notes, ask questions, participate, and do some slight reading you will be okay. biggest thing though is taking notes! attendence isnt required but you kinda need to be there for notes"
3083,2010694,5.0,1.0,Super easy class &amp; hes really nice
3084,2010694,5.0,2.0,"He is one of the best and humblest professor, I have ever taken class with. If you want to learn and get an A , get this class. Awesome personality."
3085,2010694,5.0,2.0,"He has very good knowledge of his materials. He wants you to succeed, if you show up, you will learn many. Good luck!"
3086,2010694,5.0,3.0,"Awesome, he has very good knowledge of his material. Work hard, you will be aight."
3087,2010694,3.0,3.0,"Very hard to understand, but means very well"
3088,1125982,1.0,5.0,"Don't take it, Avoid if possible! If you're a biology major he is going to turn your world upside down!"
3089,1125982,4.5,2.0,He shows a lot of interest in his students. If you study you won't fail his class. He is genuinely a nice guy and he has great passion for his work.
3090,1125982,1.0,5.0,Shows no interest in class or its students. Half way attempt at trying to help by giving review sheets that just repeat slide headlines and study sessions are a joke. steer clear of his classes if at all possible
3091,1125982,5.0,1.0,There is nothing more to say...
3092,2068064,2.0,4.0,Dr. Leach is extremely intelligent and knowledgable but not very personable. This class was comprised almost entirely of group projects that did not relate to the subject. It was frustrating not knowing how to please her. Also- participation points are required. If you are uncomfortable speaking up in class you will have extra work to do.
3093,2068064,1.0,3.0,"Class focused entirely on group work. If she liked your group, you did well. If not, you got docked points for insignificant reasons. Her personal opinions played too much into her teaching and her grading, which was frustrating considering most assignments were your opinion based. Was super excited for the class, but she ruined it for me."
3094,2068064,3.0,4.0,"Do not take a class with this professor. There are no tests, so it seems like it would be a easy class, but you probably do 5x more work because every week there is a group project. She doesn't even grade these really hard projects but they're still mandatory. She is extremely hard to please and slightly rude. Worst professor I have ever had. "
3095,1715819,1.0,4.0,"She makes this class way harder than it has to be. The test is not based on her lectures, so you have to teach yourself the material for the test from the book. She wants people to ask questions but then gets annoyed when they do. She is also very disorganized. The rubric for the projects are vague and the TAs don't grade everyone's the same.  "
3096,1715819,5.0,1.0,EASY EASY class. Definitely glad I took her this summer!! 
3097,1715819,5.0,2.0,"Very good teacher, really knows her stuff and explains in a fun way!"
3098,1715819,5.0,3.0,"The class isn't bad. You literally don't have to go to class, but it helps going to class and asking questions. The write-ups aren't bad just follow the rubric and make sure you have all the information in it. The lay summaries are SO SO EASY. You can turn it back in to get points and if you go to class you get extra credit points. Talk to your TA!"
3099,1715819,5.0,3.0,"Really good teacher, just do the work attendance isn't even required. Asking questions helps alot in this class."
3100,1715819,1.0,3.0,"She is one of the worst professor at MSU! She is disorganized and unhelpful. She vaguely goes over test material so you basically teach yourself for test.The project has no clear objectives and a vague rubric to go by, with no examples. It is also made unnecessarily hard cause she give no direction. I felt like I was going through this class blind "
3101,1715819,3.0,4.0,"As long as you follow the rubric you will do great in this class. The tests are extremely hard and very specific, but after the first project, I did great on everything else. Don't let the hype of this being a hard class get to you just follow instructions! You 1000% NEED the textbook. It has ALL the answers and examples that you need."
3102,1715819,1.0,4.0,She is very rude and makes you feel small for asking questions. By far one of the worst teachers I have had at MSU.
3103,1715819,1.0,4.0,I did not feel as though questions were welcomed by her as she would make people feel incompetent in her answers. Shes very temperamental and would snap at people for no reason. The class was unnecessarily hard because the grading varied on every project and she was very disorganized. It is a ton of work with no clear expectations.
3104,1715819,1.0,5.0,"I am a senior at state with a 4.0 GPA. This class was the worst class I have ever taken and I give most of the credit to Dr. Holmes. Project at least every 2 weeks with poor guidance. The tests are outrageously hard with the class average failing on every test. To make an A, you will need perfection for everything other than the tests."
3105,1715819,1.0,5.0,"AWFUL teacher, very annoying, makes the class way harder than it has to be. About 100 projects throughout the class honestly"
3106,1715819,4.5,2.0,"Shes very nice, tests easy if you study."
3107,2485871,1.0,4.0,"This professor includes &quot;Attendance/Participation&quot; as 5% of the total grade. If you do not raise your hand and answer questions regarding the weekly case studies, even if you don't miss a single class all semester, you will not get full credit and it will drop your total grade by 2-3 points."
3108,2354800,4.0,1.0,The lectures don't line up with the hw and tests. I never attended class or knew what was going on but I somehow made an A. The professor seems like a nice guy and gives many opportunities for extra credit. Tests are open everything.
3109,2354800,3.0,2.0,"His lectures do not help you with the tests or homework, so I stopped going. The homework is so time consuming and is hard. Test are open everything. He is a really nice guy. Gives extra credit for taking surveys about the tests. He gave us a break since spring break was taken away."
3110,2354800,4.0,2.0,He gives extra credit if you participate in his surveys. His tests are open everything except other students.
3111,2354800,3.0,3.0,Great teacher. He is kind of boring but if you study you'll pass with an A or B.
3112,2354800,4.0,3.0,"Andrew Miller is a solid choice for management informational systems. Chapter quizzes were over definitions and can be found online. There were two exams and a final. If you go to class and pay attention to lectures and review day, you shouldn't have too much problem with the exams. He also gives a lot of extra credit which helps with exams."
3113,2354800,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed Mr. Miller's class. He gave 3 exams, but gave out all the topics that would be covered on the exams in the review. He was always happy to answer any questions, and overall he tried to relate information systems to all of our majors."
3114,2354800,2.0,3.0,"Professor is not the greatest. His lectures are based on average 4 powerpoint slides but lecture lasts about an hour. But if you go to review day and get what is going to be on the test, the test are pretty straightforward."
3115,2354800,5.0,1.0,"He is pretty cool. His lectures aren't too bad, and he always lets out early. To get an A, do the quizzes on time, attend class, take every opportunity for extra credit, and pay attention during the review day."
3116,2354800,4.0,1.0,"Mr. Miller is a very straightforward instructor. He reviews the exams the day before them, and tells you exactly to study. He gives out bonus points. He tries to be interesting and funny, and he is 3/4 times. The only complaint I have is that sometimes he goes a little fast, but he always asks for questions every few slides. Nice guy overall."
3117,2150010,1.0,3.0,"Mrs. Blount was promising, but not the professor to take during a pandemic. Working a fulltime internship with a grandfather who contracted COVID-19, she was unwilling to accommodate any assignments I had missed, resulting in a C in the class. Groupwork was tough due to no one contributing. Beware before you take this course online!"
3118,2150010,5.0,2.0,I would 100% take class from Mrs. Blount again! She super sweet and understanding and was always quick to reply to my questions. She have very clear grading criteria so as long as you follow the rubrics and try you will get an A. Used the online book almost everyday so I just bought the access code not the physical book and still did well on test.
3119,2150010,4.0,4.0,"I had Mrs. Blount for production and even though her class would sometimes be challenging she managed to always make everyone feel as if they were alright and on track, she is very encouraging and I HIGHLY recommend her as a teacher. Just put in the work and you are guaranteed an A."
3120,2150010,5.0,3.0,She lays out everything you need and willing to help you. I was awful at design at the beginning of the year and got much better because of her encouragement! I wish she taught more classes because she is so kind. Make sure you follow word for word on the rubric and go to class because she gives extra credit.
3121,2150010,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Blount is a great professor, she gives great, specific feedback on assignments and really wants you to succeed. She's helpful if you're having trouble and sweet as can be. The class is mostly project based where you'll be doing the project in class, but you can leave whenever you finish. 10/10!"
3122,2150010,5.0,2.0,"She's not a bad teacher for communication, she likes participation but is also super easy to talk to. You do need to go to class in order to get credit for in-class assignments. You will do a total of 3 speeches, the last one being the group project. Her quizzes/tests are from her slides that she posts on canvas."
3123,2150010,5.0,2.0,Mrs. Blount teaches very well. She is very encouraging and sees the potential in each student.
3124,2535035,5.0,3.0,"Very kind and helpful. Made learning Japanese very interesting. Whenever she grades, she always gives feedback for you to improve. Best language professor I've had."
3125,2535035,5.0,3.0,"Kurei sensei is easily the best foreign language teacher Ive ever had. Japanese is a hard language to learn, but she makes it so fun and rewarding. Shes kind and understanding, and she takes time to help each individual student succeed. She truly loves teaching and I cant wait to take her class again. Shes the best"
3126,2535035,5.0,4.0,"Clay Sensei is an amazing professor. She worked with me several times outside of class to make sure I understood the material being covered. She cares deeply about her students as people, not just their grades. She is extremely knowledgeable about Japanese grammar and I learned a lot about Japanese culture in her classes as well."
3127,2535035,5.0,4.0,"Japanese is a very difficult language, but she teaches it super well. She is extremely engaging, and its in your best interest to put in the effort to participate with her. The class will be more enjoyable and youll learn more too. Shes very understanding when it comes to make ups, and is genuinely such a nice person."
3128,2535035,5.0,4.0,"She is the kindest person you will ever meet. She is very understanding and will help you with whatever you are going through while making sure your grade is maintained. The language is hard but with her as a professor, you are sure to succeed."
3129,2535035,5.0,4.0,She is legitimately the kindest person you will ever meet. She really cares about her students and that they do well. Its a tough class by nature but she is always willing to help with pronunciation and to answer any question. She conveys the material really well and is very funny when she plays up the drama to teach a lecture.
3130,913027,4.0,4.0,"Anderson is cool as hell. He's a fun guy who is more than enthusiastic about literature. The class requires a lot of reading and there are pop-quizzes (often gives hints) but you have to read... He's incredibly understanding and often revisions on bad grades. Cool guy, but the class isn't a walk in the park. He's a good teacher though"
3131,913027,5.0,4.0,"Anderson is incredible! He is very passionate about literature! I hate Early British lit & am retaking the class, and he is by far one of the best professors I have had. His discussions are fun and insightful. Even if you aren't an English person- this is the professor you should take if you need. Never boring."
3132,913027,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Anderson was by far my favorite professor that I've ever had. I used to go to OU where there was a great faculty, and when I transferred to MSU I admit that I didn't think the quality of education in the English dept. was going to be that great. Dr. Anderson proved me completely wrong. He is Robin Williams from The Dead Poets Society. "
3133,913027,4.5,4.0,"I like him, he's helpful and makes the class interesting. I would recommend Dr. Anderson to anyone."
3134,913027,4.5,4.0,Dr. Anderson is the one of the best professors I have had in college.  Take any and all of his classes.  I've taken 3.
3135,913027,5.0,4.0,"great teacher! fun, interesting, helpful. we had to write two papers (one 3 pg one 5 pg), two test that are short answer (can be tricky if you don't take notes)"
3136,913027,4.5,4.0,No Comments
3137,2363037,5.0,1.0,"Go to class and take notes. His tests are really easy if you do this. He is really chill and class never went the full time. Only three tests, a couple of easy papers, and in class assignments. I would recommend anyone to take him. My all time favorite professor. He does recommend a textbook to do readings, but I passed with a high A and never read"
3138,2363037,4.0,2.0,"great teacher. Read the articles he tells you to read, they WILL be on the test. His tests aren't very hard. He gives a lot of extra credit. We also had to read a book and write three papers on it (1- first half of the book, 2- second, and 3- whole book). The books are interesting and the papers aren't hard. Go to class the first day, extra credit!"
3139,2363037,4.0,1.0,"Reading is required for daily quiz but grading is fairly easy. Cool guy. offers plenty of extra credit. Only 2 test mid-term and final, but they are basicly the exact same as read quiz. I made my first 100 test grade in college in this class!"
3140,495280,4.0,3.0,"I took this as an honors class. Professor Harvey is a great guy and he knows his stuff for sure. I am not really an art person (just took this for Honors) and I didn't enjoy the class THAT much. He talks the entire time. I studied A LOT for the tests to get an A. Tests count as 75% of grade. Not an impossible class, but a lot of work in my opinion."
3141,495280,4.0,3.0,"If you do not like landscape paintings do not take Art in France. like im being serious; the majority of the class is spent looking at landscapes and personally for me landscapes are extremely boring. Dr. Harvey is a good professor though, but he has something against the number 100. the man will give you a 99.999999% but never a 100."
3142,495280,5.0,3.0,"I took Art History 2 with him and really enjoyed it. His lectures aren't boring and he is easily accessible. His exams are papers though, so if you don't like writing, I don't reccommend."
3143,495280,5.0,1.0,"It's evident that he cares, and he's very passionate about art which makes his class very enjoyable. He basically tells you what's on his exams, and the written portion is graded very generously if you justify your answer well. He also requires no extra work for honor students. I highly recommend, and I would definitely take him again."
3144,495280,5.0,3.0,Prof Harvey is so so nice! He has a super cool British accent and is very accessible outside of class. The honors section sits in with other non-honors sections and there are no extra requirements for honors students which is awesome. He offers extra credit as well. I would love to take him again!!!
3145,495280,3.0,4.0,He is a great teacher if you can learn by just listening. It's hard at first to figure out what material you need to know. Tests require memorizing 20+ paintings and also writing so be prepared to study.
3146,495280,5.0,3.0,"I loved taking this class with Mr. Harvey! He is very passionate about art history, and his voice is very nice to listen to as well! You won't need your book, likely. He does assign extra reading in it for the tests, though. As long as you pay attention in class, you won't need it since he explains everything in his lectures."
3147,495280,5.0,3.0,"Ben was a fantastic teacher! It was really great having 30 year old british art historian as an art history teacher.  He really is passionate about the history of art and is incredibly knowledgable about the topic.  Pay attention, make flash cards and read the chapters carefully and you'll be fine."
3148,495280,4.5,1.0,"Even though I find the class boring, Ben is a great teacher. He will gladly take time to talk to students. It's obvious he listens to everything you say and he always has little jokes to share in class."
3149,495280,3.5,2.0,"He's pretty cool. He is funny, but his voice makes me sleepy!"
3150,495280,5.0,2.0,"He's a really great teacher, pretty good office hours. He makes the class interesting and has something funny to say about just about anything. I definitely reccomend his class if you are willing to study"
3151,495280,4.0,3.0,"Great to work with, and is willing to work with you when it comes to planning around your schedule."
3152,495280,3.5,3.0,No Comments
3153,1855152,5.0,3.0,"Took Dr. Testa for several classes. Probably the most easy going and helpful professor on campus. If you fail his class, it is your own fault."
3154,1855152,5.0,2.0,"Presents tough material in an easy to understand manner. Does not give busy work. Makes lectures interesting and memorable. Does clear drawings on the board and emails all the PowerPoint slides after class. If you struggle with science I definitely recommend him. Tests have multiple choice and short-answer question, and can require you to draw."
3155,1855152,5.0,1.0,"He was amazing! I would retake him in a heartbeat! There were four test including the final. He always gave extra credit on the test. He tells you everything you need to know. He post his powerpoints online,but still go to class. He is very helpful, and tries to make the class interesting. He also truly cares about the students& wants feedback."
3156,1855152,5.0,3.0,"Moe is excellent, very thorough, cares a lot about his students and makes geology as painless and possibly."
3157,1855152,5.0,1.0,"Basically unless you have ""Moe"" you will get a C in this class best instructor ever! Helped us a lot and basically have us the answers to all the labs an prepared us for the tests! But the Tests are extremly difficult but that is because of Amy Hoffman!"
3158,1855152,5.0,1.0,"""Moe"" was my favorite instructor this semester.  He was really great to everyone in class, and he helped us understand the material and test better.  I would highly recommend taking one of his classes!"
3159,1855152,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, actually cares about his students and easy to talk to. I really loved his class."
3160,1855152,5.0,1.0,Awesome lab TA!!!!! I would HIGHLY recommend taking his class. Gives you answers if you can't figure it out. Very helpful and is always willing to help his students out. He is very encouraging and wants his students to do well. His class is the best one I've taken my whole college career.
3161,1437362,5.0,2.0,Dr. C is so so sweet.  She is a great teacher as well.  She really cares about what she teaches and wants you to enjoy the class.  The class is interesting as well. She is understanding and always explains her grading very well.  
3162,1437362,5.0,3.0,"Donna Clevinger is my favorite professor I've ever had. She is very understanding if you are having problems outside of class and is SO passionate about her class material. I've taken her twice now and loved her both times. You have to go to class and participate, but she makes it interesting."
3163,1437362,5.0,4.0,"Donna Clevinger is a gem. She's tough, for sure, but if you work hard and put in the effort, her class will be one of your favorites. My course was a performance-based study of classic theatre, and I enjoyed every single moment. Dr. C can be mean when she has to, but she's also hilarious if you stay on her good side."
3164,1437362,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Clevinger is a sweetheart, and her class is not necessarily hard. If you show up and participate, you will pass. HOWEVER, I will say that my personal experience with her was not great. Because of personal issues between us, she intentionally lowered my grade and lied to the board about it when I tried to dispute it. She lost my respect."
3165,1437362,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Clevinger is a wonderful professor. The class I took was discussion based, so if you were at least familiar with the material it was an easy A. We had to write one ten-page research paper and do one project, both of which were very liberal. Don't miss class without a legitimate excuse, though. Overall, Dr. Clevinger is a literal sweetheart."
3166,1437362,3.5,2.0,"One test the whole semester, lots of group projects, and participation is key. Basically, if you show up, listen, and participate you'll pass. Don't miss class without a great excuse though, she's big on punctuality and attendance. "
3167,1437362,4.0,1.0,She is super enthusiastic about the information. You have to participate but it is a very easy class.
3168,1437362,4.5,2.0,I had her for honors intro to theater. Her class is absolutely mandatory and she will not take pity on you for being even a minute late. Class attendance factors heavily into final grade.
3169,495300,4.5,3.0,"If you are a space person you will love him and his class.  The tests come from the text book that he barely skims, so you have to read on your own to pass. His lectures are him telling stories and talking about basically whatever in the universe he wants which I love."
3170,495300,4.5,4.0,"Lestrade is a cool guy, butt ive made straight 60s since day one and so far his exam is gonna be rough."
3171,495300,4.0,1.0,"Humorous,nice."
3172,495300,4.5,2.0,"Pretty cool guy, and is willing to spend time with students who need help (something most physics instructor's won't do)."
3173,495300,5.0,1.0,One of the very best as a teachers and a person I've seen in two countries. He's free from prejudices and never contests you. has a habit of looking at his part in what has gone wrong and your part in whatever is praise worthy. You will learn while being with him even if it is outside the class. A person with all this ought to be very intelligent:)
3174,495300,5.0,1.0,"Easy class. Awesome lectures. Dr. Lestrade makes class fun and interesting. If you read and does what he tells you, you will get an A. It's damn near impossible to fail this class. If you fail, you obviously deserve it."
3175,495300,4.0,4.0,gr8 teacher
3176,495300,4.0,3.0,"Pretty awesome teacher, has a great sense of humor.  The bottom line to do well is go to class always, and read the book as you go along, not all at the last minute.  The tests are based on the book,& things he says in class, even little funny things, he will put on a test.  Just go to class, you wont regret it. P.S. He looks like Sean Connery!"
3177,495300,4.5,2.0,"Lestrade is a great professor. He was also very available and answers emails within minutes on most occasions. He makes the class interesting. You must, must must attend class, and read the book. Also, attending class ensues a spot in the front. The only problem I had is that he doesn't have the loudest voice. Use the microphone Lestrade!!!!!!"

3179,495300,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lestrade is so cool!!! His lectures are so funny! (as well as some of his crazy stories...) The class is very enlightening and if you read the book from cover to cover and come to every class, (but don't take notes, he hates that...) you should do fine on the tests!"
3180,495300,3.5,5.0,No Comments
3181,495300,5.0,2.0,"If your lazy, you will fail this class. He grades on a 15 point scale. If you failed this class, it's because of your own doing. This class requires no math just to reading."
3182,495300,5.0,3.0,"Great class. Do your reading or you wont do well on the tests. His test come strait from the book, plus it's fun."
3183,495300,2.0,4.0,No Comments
3184,495300,4.0,1.0,"Has some of the most interesting lectures on campus. Pay attention in class (it will be hard not to), and skim through the textbook for a half hour before the exams and you should do fine and learn a lot of interesting stuff."
3185,495300,3.5,4.0,No Comments
3186,929493,5.0,1.0,"I had him during the summer and he is a very easier professor. He gave a few quizzes, which were open notes, and his tests were take home, however, I don't know how he does it during the fall/spring semester. Take Him!"
3187,929493,5.0,1.0,I encourage everyone to take this class with this professor.  It will be the easiest class you ever take!  Dr. Baker is a great teacher and he really enjoys it.  Tests and quizzes are STRAIGHT from the notes.
3188,2166488,5.0,4.0,Extremely knowledgable. Real life practical applications.
3189,2723547,5.0,1.0,"This class was very easy. Her assignments include managing a budget and keeping track of your expenses throughout the semester. This helped me greatly with tracking how much money I was spending. If you go to class, she lets you use your notes on the tests. Honestly, this was my favorite class of the semester. Definitely recommend taking!"
3190,2076380,3.0,3.0,"She is absolutely hilarious. I did not learn much from her, and it really helps to already have taken Spanish if you take her class. Her quizzes are hard and tests can be challenging. Oral exams are graded hard for a Spanish 1 class."
3191,2076380,2.0,4.0,Absolutely awful. Had never taken spanish before and the first few days of class she already expected us to know what she was saying. Does not speak in spanish. no extra credit and you forsure need the book.
3192,2076380,2.0,4.0,"Doesn't teach the material. Expects students to learn on their own outside of class with all material and gets mad if a student doesn't understand during class and asks questions. Constantly saying snide remarks such as ""Can't wait to see this train wreck,"" before grading homework or quizzes.  DO NOT TAKE IF YOU'VE NEVER TAKEN SPANISH BEFORE!"
3193,2076380,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Arroyo is a great Spanish I teacher. I enjoyed her class. She has a lot of group activities which are not my favorite, but they did help. You need to go to class and bring your textbook. Also there are homework activities every night (but that is departmental, not her thing specifically). Bottom line, I would recommend her for Spanish I."
3194,1707750,5.0,4.0,"His powerpoints for notes do not have a lot of information, instead you need to listen to his class discussion and lectures. He does a great job of giving you information to study for his tests by uploading videos of lecture and study guides. Overall, great teacher and you will learn a lot. "
3195,1707750,5.0,3.0,Dr. McMillen is great!! He is so helpful outside of class and he posts recording lectures on canvas for us to watch before tests! His study guides are exactly like the test so it makes it easier to study. He cares about his students success! Take him.
3196,1707750,5.0,2.0,"He gives 5 exams, but none of them are cumulative. He also posts online lectures in case you have to miss. He uses the powerpoints as a guide, so the only real difficult thing about him is that his test material is from what he says. He gives extra credit if asked, and there's study guides for every exam. He appreciates class interaction a lot."
3197,1707750,2.0,3.0,PowerPoints are vague. He attempts to teach you in class but tends to get off on one subject rather than the entire lesson. Must read the book if you want to pass a test. He gets flustered sometimes and tends to confuse you more than teach you. HIS FAVORITE EXAMPLE: TOBACCO USE AND CIGARETTES.
3198,1707750,2.0,3.0,He likes to talk about cigarettes and his lectures suck. Better read the textbook or you won't pass.
3199,724714,5.0,4.0,"I had a great time in Jamie Dyers class. He teaches the material in a way that develops deeper understanding of the weather. Expect many equations, of course. Dr. Dyer is the one to go to for practical application question."
3200,724714,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Dyer is a hard professor, and his tests are by no means easy, but he will work with you and you will learn a lot. Put forth the effort and you will make it through and learn a lot."
3201,724714,5.0,4.0,Great knowledge of Physics and Physical Properties of the Earth's system. Teaches in an easy-going manner. Does not choose favorites. Respects his students for the effort they put into the coursework.
3202,724714,4.0,4.0,"I had him for Dynamics I. Great professor! The material can be confusing, but he tries to help out in any way he can."
3203,724714,4.0,5.0,Great teacher and great class.  You will work hard but it is worth it.  Thanks Jamie!
3204,724714,4.5,5.0,It was a lot of work but it was worth the time!
3205,724714,4.5,4.0,"He is so sweet. KInda goofy which makes class great. Not as moody as other professors but seems frusterated with interuptions. Makes a lot of jokes and laughs at himself, but still expects the class to stay focused and on schedule. I enjoy his lectures."
3206,724714,4.5,4.0,No Comments
3207,724714,4.5,3.0,"Good Teacher, Doesn't take himself too seriously which is nice in this nerdy profession we are going into.  Offers help outside of class.  Grades Fairly though tests are a little confusing."

3209,724716,5.0,4.0,Great teacher
3210,724716,5.0,5.0,"Okay I had this guy in 4 classes and labs.  I cannot leave this site without making up for the one bad comment listed.  Of anyone, this guy cared.  Sure he was hard at times and way picky, but it was for our own good.  How many professors have you had who cared if you found a job!"

3212,724716,3.0,3.0,"Wayne I am sure is a great guy inside... he is a very good professor.. knows his stuff, but his main drawback is his attitude. I have never seen a grown man throw as many temper tantrums as this guy. Not what I'd call professional behavior in a university setting. Aside from that... he's a great guy. He just needs to keep the attitude in check."
3213,724717,3.0,4.0,"We only had 3 tests all semester because he wanted to take it slow so we could learn everything. On the assignments, he would only put the percent you got on the assignment so you never knew how much each point was worth. Therefore you couldn't calculate your grade. We didn't have a textbook, which would've helped. Too difficult for an intro class."
3214,724717,3.0,5.0,"The lectures are long and he basically reads off the notes given. The four homework assignments, midterm and exam are timed. However, it felt like there wasn't enough time to comprehend the questions fully because, you were  trying to beat the clock."
3215,724717,5.0,2.0,"The quizes can be a bit 'random detaily' at times, but besides that he's a great teacher. He's willing to help, and is always sitting in his office with the door open."
3216,724717,4.5,2.0,"Great professor! I didn't always understand everything the best, but whenever I had an issue with something he was more than happy to explain things to me. He's got a great sense of humor and is very approachable. I would highly recommend him as a professor!"
3217,724717,5.0,2.0,Great professor! He expects you to know your stuff. Pay attention and ask questions when you don't understand something and you'll be fine.
3218,724717,4.0,5.0,"It's not that he shows favoritism.. He just doesn't have any respect for those who do not show any interest in his class. If you're in Synoptic or WX Analysis, you should have enough interest in the material that you would want to learn. Otherwise, find another major. I guarantee that the ones who didn't make it in this class were in the wrong majo"
3219,724717,5.0,2.0,Dr. Dixon is a wonderful teacher! LOVE him. He's very approachable and very helpful. All you have to do is tell him when you need help with something and he will do everything in his power to help you!
3220,724717,1.5,3.0,It is truely a shame that Dr. Dixon is so rude and is so arrogant because he realy knows his stuff. He is completely inapproachable and does not convey his messages well.  He does get very proud of himself when he figures out a way to explain things.
3221,724717,1.5,3.0,By far one of the worst teachers I've ever had.  The assignments weren't even relevant.
3222,724717,2.0,3.0,I am in analysis II right now had him in analysis I and synoptic last fall.  I did fine but hated the class.  Dr. Dixon is not a good teacher and not much of a person.  Just treat everyone equal and stop making fun of people outside of class.  If you are his buddy you are in good shape if not you need to watch your back.
3223,724717,2.0,3.0,So very cocky.  Don't have him teach the same students at the same time as Dr. Brown cause it shows just how poor of a teacher Dr. Dixon is.  If you have to take him try to get on his good side as he shows favortism
3224,724717,2.0,1.0,Terrible!  Teach us.  I don't want to hear a bunch of presenations by other students.  I did not learn a thing from this class.  Why is Dr. Dixon here&#63;
3225,724717,2.5,4.0,I agree with the other comment about favoritism.
3226,724717,1.5,3.0,Try to become one of his favorites and you will do fine.  I have never seen a professor so clearly favor certain students.  I hope he leaves MSU soon
3227,724717,5.0,3.0,awesome guy :) he really cares if you understand the material and is very understanding. a really fun teacher. highly recommended!
3228,1707765,5.0,2.0,"He is a teacher that wants you to pass, but do not take advantage and not show up to class. I learned a lot, and the group project was interesting."
3229,1617655,3.5,2.0,"Good class. Practicums vs. tests, and they're pretty hard. She's a reasonable grader, though, and she WANTS you to pass the class, which helps. You HAVE to read the book for a quiz, but she let it be open-book. Follows the syllabus. Overall, good teacher. Has been in the flower business for years, and she knows her stuff."
3230,2043672,1.0,3.0,He does not teach. He treats and speaks to his students like dogs. He grades papers based on personal whims and doesn't give feedback that helps the student develop writing skills. You will spend most classes listening to him read out of the textbook and explain basic vocabulary. Get a different teacher if possible.  
3231,1609497,5.0,2.0,I really enjoyed his class! This class was pretty easy had an A all throughout the semester until the end. 
3232,1609497,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Nicholson is a very nice guy, but talks a lot during class and sometimes gets off topic. However, he makes class very interesting for those who listen. He does take up the entire class time so don't expect to be leaving early. His tests are not hard. He doesn't give out a crazy amount of homework, but assignments are handed out IN CLASS."
3233,1609497,5.0,2.0,"While he does talk for a while, he keeps it interesting. Hes very good at keeping you engaged and tells stories from his past that can relate to what you are learning. This is my favorite class Ive taken here!"
3234,1609497,4.0,3.0,"I've had him multiple times and his classes are quite confusing. During lectures, he'll get off track from time to time which would confuse the class. He didn't necessarily teach CRT but I felt like he tried to hint it out to the class if that makes sense. Overall he's a nice guy and if you take his class you should get a good grade."
3235,1609497,5.0,2.0,Dr. Nicholson is so much fun. I always looked forward to attending his lectures. He loves audience participation and explains concepts well. The only problem is he is not good at posting quizzes on time and takes a while to grade exams.
3236,1609497,5.0,2.0,"He is a really good professor. The lectures are entertaining and I thought his class was really easy. He doesn't answer emails, so you have to skype him to contact him but he usually gets back fast that way. The tests are easy as long as you have the textbook pulled up. He writes his own and gave it to us for free. I would highly recommend!"
3237,1609497,4.0,1.0,"He's a really funny guy and I enjoyed his lectures. This was a really easy class as long as you pull up his textbook. He wrote it himself so you don't have to pay for it. But, half the time I was so confused because he tells lots of stories. Not a bad thing though!"
3238,1609497,5.0,3.0,"He wrote his own textbook, so it is super helpful when it comes to studying for his tests. His tests seem harder than they are. He offers a lot of open note quizzes and class activities that really help your grade if you do them. His lectures are always so entertaining and I really enjoy them, and he is super interactive."
3239,1609497,1.0,4.0,"I had professor Nicholson as my teacher for communication theory and small group communication and do not recommend. Extremely unorganized, doesn't explain assignments well at all, doesn't stick to due dates and overall his lectures give me a headache bc he is crazy."
3240,1609497,4.0,3.0,"You will think you failed that test every single time and you didnt. Theres a lot to study but if you get the gist of it youll be fine. Lots of quizzes and little assignments here and there that are super easy. Attendance counts and you cant scan and leave because he does a sign in sheet. Not bad, gets a little boring"
3241,1609497,4.0,3.0,"Honestly, you will think you are failing the whole semester, then lo and behold, you will have grades added from all the classwork and extra credit opportunities and boom your grade will raise two or three letter grades."
3242,1609497,3.0,4.0,"You will not be bored with Dr Nicholson. He is a very funny guy. I genuinely enjoyed going to class. I will say he is very opinionated. He really believes he knows his stuff, and I would say that he does. The class itself can be very difficult. His lectures might have nothing to do with the tests. Which can be pretty tough if you dont read the book"
3243,1609497,3.0,3.0,"Funny. But full of himself. Lectures are interesting, but you definitely have to study outside of class. I went to his office one day and he was rude and unwilling to help. Not okay."
3244,1609497,2.0,4.0,"Professor Nicholson is quite the character. He is a smart guy and most definitely knows what he's teaching, but his lectures are all over the place. I survived this course by finding my information in the textbook for his excruciating tests. He's great to listen to, but very often, you won't leave class with the information you need for the tests."
3245,1609497,5.0,3.0,Hilarious teacher. Relates almost every lecture to something funny from his life. 10/10 funny professor and actually my favorite.
3246,1609497,5.0,2.0,"He's a really interesting, funny teacher. When he teaches he tells really funny stories and makes the class laugh. In order to do well, you have to listen but also read the textbook. However the textbook is an easy read with short chapters, so its not hard. Awesome class!"
3247,1609497,2.5,3.0,"Dr. Nicholson is very enthusiastic about the subjects he teaches. Unfortunately, he doesn't really teach much of them, you have to read the book to pass his enormous tests. He can be a jerk, he's very opinionated, and he likes to spoil the endings of current TV shows. Some of us watch Hulu, John, and we're a day behind -- major cool points lost."
3248,1609497,4.5,3.0,"He is a great teacher and I really enjoyed his class! Does a great job relating the info to things you'll remember. A lot true and false questions on tests, but study and you should do fine."
3249,1609497,4.0,2.0,Great teacher. Good at relating the material to whats going on in the world. Tests are relatively easy if you study. Extra point opportunties
3250,2674457,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Righi actually cares about her students. She&#39;s very helpful outside of class and very understanding of how hard it is to be an engineering student. She doesn&#39;t mind going back over topics if you don&#39;t understand them the first time. She gave extra credit on homework if you answered questions in class.
3251,2674457,5.0,2.0,Great instructor. Helpful during office hours class.
3252,2674457,5.0,2.0,Mrs. righi is a great teacher. She doesnt mind re-explaining when you ask her questions. Tests are relatively easier than homework and cover what we did in class and assignments. Her practice tests and review are very helpful. She is also always accessible for office hours on Webex.
3253,2674457,1.0,2.0,"The homework she assigns is astronomically harder than the material covered in the book or lecture. She may be accessible out of class, but shes not very helpful. However, she is an extremely light grader and there are good resources on YouTube to help you actually learn."
3254,2674457,5.0,4.0,"Statics is a tough class, so it is almost impossible to make every lecture crystal clear. Mrs. Righi is a PhD student who is very helpful outside of class, though, whether it is online or through e-mail. She listens to the students. She also gives a lot of extra credit and the final replaces the lowest test grade if you go to class."
3255,1314587,5.0,3.0,I took her biostats class at SVSU. She is a great teacher. Gives a bunch of examples. It's a pretty good amount of work but nothing impossible. A lot of homework and quizzes but gives out a lot of extra credit and drops your lowest quiz.
3256,1314587,5.0,1.0,Very good teacher. I hardly had to study for quizzes and tests because she explained everything so well in class.
3257,1314587,4.5,3.0,This proffesor is an awesome teacher for Calculus I. i would recomend her for everybody who can use a great teacher who explains everything well. she is also very flexible with office hours and will help you at any time of the day (even weekends).
3258,1756977,4.0,4.0,"Osman wasnt hard, but her TAs sure are. You feel like the outside readings never end and it makes you feel overwhelmed come exam time. Her lectures are actually not bad, and she really tries to be funny and relatable. But the discussion sections are not fun when you have 30 pages to read and remember. Two papers for the class. Not a bad course!"
3259,1756977,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Osman always makes class fun, interesting, and tries to get the class engaged in the material. Her grading was extremely fair, and what you would expect for an upper level history class. Pay attention, take good notes, and study and youll get A. She even gives you the essay prompt in advance so tests are easy. Offered to help with papers too"
3260,1756977,3.0,3.0,"Your semester is pretty much determined by two papers, a midterm, &amp; a final. You have to do discussion sections every week that require a lot of reading. You get weekly grades but theyre small &amp; very dependent on who your TA is. Osman is sweet but a little eccentric. Lectures are not posted anywhere so make sure your notes are solid."
3261,1756977,4.0,3.0,"dr. osman gave fantastic lectures and had clear expectations. we had an in class writing every week, two papers, a midterm, and a final. everything was graded by TAs. reading is required to pass and participation counts towards your grade in the weekly sections but if you do the work and take notes, the class is pretty simple. she's a good choice!"
3262,1756977,3.0,4.0,"Extremely critical on your writings. If you don't read the readings, you won't pass the In-Class Writings on the readings, and be sure to bring the readings to class with you. The teacher does not like if you disagree with her on anything. Overall, the class is difficult, but the discussions and interactions help with the class. Take good notes."
3263,1756977,4.0,2.0,"Grades are based off of 2 papers, 2 tests, and weekly quizzes on primary source readings. I really enjoy Osman's lectures.. She is so funny, and passionate about what she teaches. However, all of your work is graded by TAs, so I feel like the grades everyone receives depend on who graded it. Also, slides aren't on canvas so make sure you take notes"
3264,1756977,4.0,2.0,Early Western World is a relatively easy class. midterm and final are all short answer but she gives you the exact questions ahead of time. discussion on Fridays is where most of the grades come from. there is a short answer question based on the reading for the week. TA's are awesome. they do most of the grading. lectures are interesting.
3265,1756977,4.0,3.0,Very nice teacher that is passionate about the material. There are no tests which is annoying coming from a history class but if you go to class and do a couple short papers you should be able to get an A. TA's do some of the grading but you can reach out to Dr. Osman any time and she is happy to help. She keeps lectures pretty interesting as well.
3266,1756977,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Osman was the most phenomenal history professor! She really knows her stuff, and her lectures got past the nitty gritty facts to the actual points really well. She gives awesome feedback and is super accessible, and she really wants her students to do well in her class."
3267,1756977,5.0,2.0,"Very entertaining professor, took her for an elective but it was probably my most enjoyable class of the semester. It was online, but lectures were enjoyable and the work isn't just memorization of data like most history classes. Definitely recommend."
3268,1756977,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Osman is a phenomenal professor! She really takes time to get to know her students, and as long as you put forth the effort to attend lectures and participate in discussions, learning from her is a breeze. She has a super awesome lecture style, and her humor is corny if not endearing. Pay attention and learn how to write, and you're good to go!"
3269,1756977,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Osman only had 2 grades for her class- midterm and the final which were both essay formatted. Outside of the lecture, you had to go to a discussion section and participate in order to receive that credit and attendance was expected. Weekly readings and then discussion essays on the readings. Dr. Osman was an excellent lecturer and very fun."
3270,1756977,5.0,2.0,She is great! Makes the lectures VERY interesting however she doesnt put her notes online.
3271,1756977,5.0,2.0,"Her lectures are extremely enjoyable. She is funny and passionate. You must take notes and attend lecture. You also need to read documents each week and attend discussion section. If you do this (and pay attention), the tests are a breeze. You have two papers, which take time, but aren't difficult if you go to class. She gives extra credit too."
3272,1756977,5.0,4.0,Dr. Osman is an absolute hoot! I thoroughly enjoyed her class! We had 2 papers due throughout the semester and weekly in class writings about documents assigned to us. She makes history extremely fun and interesting! I would 100% take her for every one of my classes if I could.
3273,1756977,1.0,4.0,"I agree with one of the previous students stating that Dr. Osman likes you to agree with her perspectives on history. I would not recommended deviating from her opinions when writing papers, no matter how well founded or defended. She is frequently rude and aggressive towards her students. Her lectures are interesting but sometimes hard to follow."
3274,1756977,3.0,4.0,expects a lot from you
3275,1756977,4.0,3.0,She's really funny and makes lectures interesting.  The lectures are needed so you can get notes for the midterm and final.  Every week you have quizzes which are hard if you don't do the readings which are sometimes really lengthy.  The class itself wasn't bad and she's really awesome.
3276,1756977,3.0,5.0,"If you like to spend your day bogged down with complex readings and taking pop quizzes everyday, then she's right up your alley."
3277,1756977,4.5,3.0,"great teacher, very knowledgeable and passionate so it makes it easier to learn. She engages with students and makes class interesting. Very interesting class, hard to doze off. Best teacher I have had in my four years of college and would recommend her to anyone. cons: she enjoys in class group work and you will stay for the entire class period."
3278,1756977,3.0,4.0,"Pros - mandatory books collectively cost $20  Cons -   Doesn't post slides Skims over parts of History she doesn't like Not objective at all (i.e. write a paper disagreeing with her opinion, you'll get a D) Lots of reading (20-30 pg/week) Short temper/rude Seems to be constantly distracted   Would not take again bottom line. "
3279,1756977,4.5,4.0,"She talks really fast, but clearly, so you can still understand her. Prepare to take a LOT of notes- if you don't take really good notes, you'll be dead by the end of the semester. She's hilarious, and does her best to make the class engaging. Very helpful as well, she will answer any question as long as it's relevant. "
3280,1756977,4.5,3.0,She was awesome! I really enjoyed her class and she kept things interesting. She made a class that I was afraid would be horribly boring into one that I looked forward to; I would definitely recommend her. Only thing I would say is to take a computer for notes or be a fast writer as she goes kind of fast.
3281,1756977,5.0,3.0,Great professor. Would love to take her again
3282,1756977,4.5,2.0,She is a really great teacher. Funny and insightful. I highly suggest her as a professor.
3283,1199932,4.0,5.0,"Good teacher, just a really tough course. If you study for 3-5 days in advance, you will do well. Excel assignments are a large portion of your grade, in class and homework."
3284,1199932,5.0,3.0,She tries to make the class intersting and she is very good at using alot of examples to explain the material.  Test are easy if you study the study guide word for word.  Class isn't mandatory but she does take roll and it's brownie points if you attend class all the time.  She gives alot of in class quizzes and is very helpful if you need helpful.
3285,741188,1.0,3.0,I'd taken her before for an interviewing course and she WAS one of my favorite teachers. This class she was very different. She complained a lot. At times had arguments with students. It was like walking on egg shells around her. Everything was about her dissertation. She never helped us and hardly taught during the course of the class.
3286,741188,4.0,3.0,"i dreaded going into this class but it was fun, and she was hot in a way"
3287,741188,4.0,4.0,"Stacey made public speaking fun and interesting.  If you have to take CO 1003, try to Stacey Mann!"
3288,741188,5.0,1.0,"I hated speaking in front of people before this class, but Stacey made it a relaxed, fun environment. She's extremely helpful and makes you feel very comfortable. She's a great teacher!"
3289,741188,5.0,2.0,"Stacey is AWESOME! Good teacher, makes Public Speaking interesting, helps students feel more comfortable about speaking in front of others."
3290,741188,4.5,2.0,Stacey is a great teacher-so much fun and the class isn't burdensome. Great for people who are afraid of public speaking!
3291,741188,4.0,2.0,"I really dreaded taking this class, but she made it fun and interesting.  Prepare early for your speeches and you should have no problem getting a good grade."
3292,741188,4.5,2.0,"She is very clear in what she requires and expects.  As long as you have each of the requirements in your speech such as a thesis, attention getter, etc. you will make a good grade. The tests are multiple choice. She is however very strict on the topics you can talk about and has a long list of terminal topics which can't be used."
3293,741188,5.0,2.0,No Comments
3294,741188,5.0,1.0,She is a very nice teacher and she allow you to have fun and express yourself in your speeches.  She is so FUNNY
3295,2289493,2.0,4.0,He is a new teacher and is not very good at his job. Be ready to read the book and teach the material to yourself. Focus on working problems and getting a good grade in the lab to bring up your score. Do not forget to do online work because it is the only thing to bring up your grade. No extra credit.
3296,2289493,1.0,5.0,Burke gave tests with problems that were never taught in class and then wondered why the test average was a 40. Didn't reopen homework even though the assignments all had different times they were due and the dates and times were not announced in class. Didn't seem concerned that most students were failing and did little to help raise the average.
3297,2289493,1.0,4.0,"While he seems like a pretty nice guy, Dr. Burke's lack of experience and inability to effectively get his points across to students leaves something to be desired especially in a subject as difficult as Chemistry. The poor TA's were left to pick up his slack. He also added an extra lecture time, which was not accessible to all students."
3298,2289493,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Burk is a very intelligent man, however he is an awful teacher. He skips over important powerpoint slides and claims we should already know the information. He will not bump, and does not reopen homework like the rumors say he does. Test are nothing like review problems or examples and were sometimes over stuff we had never learrned."
3299,2289493,1.0,5.0,Just dont.
3300,2289493,3.0,4.0,"He does seem to care about students, at least in office hours and he'll always give you an extension on whatever assignment you need. However, his teaching style is pretty bland with a lack of in depth explanations that I would attribute to inexperience teaching and just how crappy the chem department has structured their class. Too much material!!"
3301,2289493,1.0,4.0,This was his first year teaching. You can tell hes a very smart man but the way he presents lectures and reads off the PowerPoints you can see that hes not a good teacher. He says that all the work is just easy right or you guys made 60 percent so lets make it harder the next time. If everyone is flunking maybe the problem is you. Work hard!
3302,2289493,3.0,3.0,"Answered questions in his office hours &amp; in class but wasn't the best at answering emails. He basically read from the slides at a fast pace so I basically taught myself. Department tests (could be tricky). He never told us when homework was due, so it was up to us to know when it was due. If you don't miss more than 4 classes you get 50 bonus pts."
3303,2289493,4.0,4.0,"Chemistry is hard, but he does a good job of explaining. He is very open to students asking questions in class, and he wants to see his students succeed."
3304,2289493,3.0,1.0,"This year was his first year of teaching. He got confused very easily. Basically all he does is read directly off of the slides that he posts online. He then works practice problems half way and says, &quot;Y'all got it right?&quot; The only reason our class has a 75 average is because we teach ourselves from the powerpoint."
3305,1347414,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Holt is amazing! It's an easy class for sure, but that doesn't lessen the quality of it! He gives amazing lectures that are super entertaining. For those who have never taken him before, at first, his lectures might sound big and confusing, but stick with him! He's probably one of the best professors at State."
3306,1347414,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Holt is the professor if you're looking for an easy A. His class is graded solely on canvas quizzes, which if you are in class, he makes right in front of you so you have all the answers. I suggest going to class and using it as a study hall as he doesn't care if you are on your phone or computer and pay him no attention. "
3307,1347414,5.0,1.0,"dr. holt is one of the best professors i've ever taken. the dude is incredibly smart and he cares about his students. lectures aren't mandatory, but they are always entertaining. definitely recommend this class to any and everyone!"
3308,1347414,5.0,1.0,"I went to class only three times this semester and passed with an A (he only counts attendance if ur a freshman) He is funny, kind and gives multiple attempts at quizzes/exams. You don't need the textbook really. Can use notes, classmates, internet resources, textbook, etc on every test. If you need an easy A, this is definitely the class to take."
3309,1347414,5.0,1.0,"the easiest teacher ive ever taken, he is super sweet &amp; the class is not hard at all"
3310,1347414,5.0,1.0,"I took Dr. Holt for History of Western Philosophy II. The only grades we had were two tests that almost everyone made a 100 on. Very easy class, but the readings and lectures are incredible as well. Dr. Holt gives fantastic lectures about genuinely fascinating readings. I seriously recommend doing the work and participating in his class."
3311,1347414,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Holt is possibly my favorite professor at State. If you can take one of his classes, do it! He's really passionate &amp; it makes the lectures interesting, plus he's just a genuinely hilarious dude. Tests &amp; quizzes are easy. Attendance isn't mandatory, but I would go to class anyway because he's super entertaining. Take him if you need a PHI class!"
3312,1347414,5.0,2.0,Dr. Holt is fantastic. He's clearly passionate about the subject and makes class interesting. The few quizzes and/or tests he gives are easy. Attendance isn't mandatory but I would show up just to hear him talk. Great guy - I would love to take another of his classes.
3313,1347414,5.0,2.0,Great and fun teacher
3314,1347414,5.0,2.0,Hey ya'll need to take Holt for your first philosophy class. He was so funny and caring and passionate about his teaching that I was inspired to change my major (not to philosophy lol) If you read and listen in class you're going to learn something about the world and yourself; do yourself a favor and take a class by Holt
3315,1347414,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Holt is an amazing professor. If given the chance, take one of his classes. You will not regret it. His classes are not hard to pass; in fact, they are harder to fail. Just show up for class, listen to his lectures, and try to answer questions, and his classes will be the most enjoyable you can take."
3316,1347414,5.0,1.0,"You will not regret taking Dr. Holt's classes. He is a hilarious guy, and his class is never dull or boring. Show up and laugh at his jokes and you'll do fine. His lectures are really interesting, so it won't be hard to pay attention."
3317,1347414,5.0,1.0,You will never regret taking any course by Lynn Holt. AMAZING GUY!!!!!
3318,1347414,3.5,2.0,Very dramatic. Funny guy.
3319,2674527,4.0,3.0,This class was pretty easy if you do the homework and pay attention to the lectures. Prof. Ontiveros gave lectures that were either very short or very long. I would recommend this professor for an online course.
3320,2420575,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Jones is a good choice. He goes over so many examples and provides study guides for every test. The tests are a little short which makes them hard to ace, but the homework and quizzes aren't bad and help boost your grade. Attendance isn't mandatory, but the worked examples aren't posted so you won't get them if you don't come to class."
3321,2420575,1.0,4.0,Terrible about explaining things and doesn't communicate the problems well and tests are short and hard which makes it hard to pass them.
3322,2420575,4.0,3.0,"I liked Jeffrey Jones. Hes younger so he was able to explain in more understandable ways. I hate math, but his office hours were very beneficial which made the work load very manageable and easier. He seemed to be nervous and never really relaxed while teaching, but understandable for his first year. Id recommend him, but never take trig again!"
3323,2420575,3.0,3.0,He is a good teacher and goes over many examples. He is a little awkward because this was his first class to teach and he seems to seek approval from his students by making jokes and always glancing at us. But he is available to answer questions and is very good at conveying all of the information to make the course easier.
3324,2010981,4.0,4.0,"You have to go to class to understand the material &amp; for attendance, but Mme Dunlap makes it fun and she's hilarious. If you don't do your work it's frustrating for her and embarrassing for you, but if you try she's happy to help you out. Very caring; she wants everyone to succeed."
3325,2010981,1.0,4.0,"I regret ever taking her. She humiliates students who dont understand the material, and criticizes those who have the audacity to ask a question"
3326,2010981,5.0,1.0,She is super sweet and funny.  I loved being in her class
3327,1298296,5.0,2.0,Dr. French was one of the best professors I had in my masters program at MSU. I highly recommend him.
3328,1298296,5.0,4.0,I had Dr. French on my Dissertation committee and he gave me more ideas and helped me more than anyone! MSU is lucky to have him and great person to work with.
3329,1298296,5.0,4.0,Had Dr. French for Ph.D. Scope.  Really was helpful and taught me a lot. Take him if you can.
3330,1298296,5.0,3.0,Teaches a limited amount of classes (think he is dept head) but take if you can.  Good teacher but also cares about students.
3331,1298296,4.5,3.0,"Can be a little arrogant at times, but knows his stuff.  Just read the material and you will be fine."
3332,1298296,5.0,3.0,"Dr. French is great.  Can take the research and relate it in a way students can understand.  Take him if you can, but he is the grad coord. so he teaches a limit amount of classes."
3333,1298296,5.0,2.0,Best prof at MSU
3334,1298296,5.0,2.0,Great class and French is the best I have had in the department.  Great teacher
3335,1298296,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely amazing professor. Brilliant, interesting, and really cares about his students."
3336,143229,1.0,5.0,He is unfair
3337,143229,3.0,4.0,He'll do you a favor....just ask.
3338,143229,4.0,4.0,No Comments
3339,143229,1.5,4.0,His directions for assignments were very unclear and I found him unreliable.  He never responded to my phone calls or e-mails
3340,2822031,1.0,5.0,"If you want to save stress, time, money, your heart, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.I had to become a teacher to myself for months. he works the problem for his satisfaction, does not care about the job, not even for the students, but only the money. 98.2 percent of the class has to teach their selves when we leave his class. Do Not take this class."
3341,167827,4.0,2.0,"Mr. Gardner is a pretty easygoing teacher. As long as you put effort into your speeches, you'll pass easily. The reading isn't hard at all, especially since he goes over the material in class. The hardest part is picking a topic for your speeches, but he gives you plenty of time to think about it."
3342,167827,5.0,2.0,"Sweetest man on this campus! He truly cares about every single one of his students and wants the best for us. Textbook is required, and notes have to be taken before class for quizzes. But you get to use your handwritten notes on all quizzes and tests, so it's worth it! Speeches are very laid back and stress free. 10/10 recommend!"
3343,167827,5.0,1.0,"This class couldn't be easier, he lets you use all your notes on the tests and quizzes! He's an awesome teacher and human! I absolutely loved his class and if I could I would take him again! Also don't worry about the speeches, he really just grades off of if you tried and attempted it. Do the work, get an A"
3344,167827,5.0,1.0,"Awesome teacher, he is very leanient and loves to teach."
3345,954261,5.0,1.0,"You basically just show up and write a review for the lecture, the only grading for the review is that it is 5 sentences and that it has the lecturer's name in it. super easy class. Dr. Brown is awesome, relatable, and super sweet."
3346,954261,5.0,1.0,"This is by no means a &quot;real class&quot; and you can tell Dr. Brown doesn't take it seriously either. I imagine in her upper echelon of classes, she's probably more resourceful. As for Dr. Brown as a person, would definitely recommend. Slightly hypocritical as a professor, does AMAZING research, which is where her interest truly lies."
3347,954261,3.5,5.0,Her tests are hard but she tells really interesting stories to try and relate the information to your life.
3348,954261,2.5,5.0,"She's a really cool person, but not a very good teacher."
3349,2125719,1.0,5.0,She was very hard.
3350,2125719,5.0,1.0,She will let you retake your work she was so easy.
3351,2125719,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bracey is pretty easy-going, but sets standards very high for her students. I enjoy learning from her because she is so down to earth, yet very well respected in her field."
3352,2125719,2.5,3.0,Her class is pretty straightforward. Assignments are all set up for the semester. Exams are based on the quizzes so make sure you make note of the answers and questions. The same typos in the quizzes are also in the exams. It takes forever for her to grade assignments.
3353,954263,1.0,4.0,"Be prepared to be good at test taking. Her principles of microeconomics class relies entirely on your ability to take tests. If you're like me and learn better through homework applications, find something that can help you. She gives little to no supplementary material enforcing you to do much of the work on your own. "
3354,954263,1.0,3.0,Took her for Public Finance. Nice lady however very unorganized and it shows. 2 exams make up 60% of your grade. If youre conservative or libertarian brace yourself for an onslaught of liberal and democratic narrative. She said she requires participation however nowhere did it show up in our grades. Exams were open note but incredibly difficult.
3355,954263,4.0,2.0,"yes, she does make it interesting, and she has a quirky sense of humor. (i think she's on here twice)"
3356,954263,5.0,3.0,The teacher is much more interesting than the book.
3357,954263,4.0,4.0,"Keen and somewhat costic & assertive in her presentation, but nice too look at a red head when thoughts drift from the topic being presented."
3358,2125721,4.0,3.0,I'm surprised by the previous ratings as I have not had the same experience. The assignments have been consistent and were clearly outlined at the beginning of the semester. There were some discrepancies but she would correct these in favor of the students. She emphasized sharing your thoughts and experiences on her assignments.
3359,2125721,2.0,3.0,Took her for TECH-4143 and the class was built on some other class from two years ago(still had old assignments there) horrible layout for readings and other materials. Would not recommend. 
3360,2125721,1.0,4.0,Worst instructor ever. I don't know how she has a Ph.D. Her class is the most confusing I've ever taken and she doesn't seem to care about what students are needing. We have no clue where we stand in the class because we're only graded on  weekly answers to discussion questions and the one chapter we have to actually teach to the rest of the class.
3361,1658778,4.0,4.0,"Very enthusiastic about the subject. He teaches hard material so of course the class will be hard but he is more than willing to help you, no matter how long it takes. He truly cares about you learning the material. Don't take him if you are looking for an easy A, but if you're looking for that you probably shouldn't be in engineering anyway."
3362,1658778,4.0,3.0,"He provided great notes and was usually available for help at any time. The class gradually became harder. Not much HW to do, but he provides plenty of examples to look at. He does not work problems out in class, just briefly discusses them. A drop grade was given"
3363,1658778,2.0,4.0,"Warren's test are unfair and take far too long to complete. For a general engineering course a regular test should NOT take 3+ hours to complete. I had an awful time in this class, It was poorly taught. If you don't learn by teachers just talking at you then do not take this teacher. And if you like actual fair tests, don't take this teacher."
3364,2248608,5.0,1.0,"If you need to take this class, don't even think about stressing about it. Dr. Gardner makes it so simple!"
3365,2248608,5.0,2.0,I took her online vet medical terminology class and I enjoyed it. there is a discussion grade and a quiz grade each week and there are 3 tests in the overall course.
3366,2527137,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed Professor Rhymess Comp II class! He was very understanding and accessible outside of class. His material was clear, and he always got our grades back in a timely manner!"
3367,2527137,2.0,4.0,He gives homework about once a week on top of a paper due. When giving feedback on papers he does not give much and if he does more than likely you won't be able to read his hand writing to do the corrections. If you miss class then more than likely your grade will go down because he gives an assignment in class every day. No makeup work.
3368,954272,5.0,3.0, 
3369,954272,5.0,2.0,I have loved my retailing class with her and I would love to be her friend. there are weekly DBs but they are EASY. I have literally never read a book for this class. I feel very average about her tests-they're on honorlock but there's a Quizlet for every test so just study and you'll make an A. U have to write 2 papers but they're really not bad!!
3370,954272,1.0,5.0,Has the most unnecessary assignments for NOOOO reason. Literally would've rather mopped the ocean than take this class
3371,954272,2.0,4.0,"The class gave feedback. Biggest concern: tests. This is a grad class. 1st time using honorlock. Test was written to be difficult to understand vs what we learned. A 3-4 pg paper every week plus discussion. So we really dug in the concepts so why no notes?! Plus a final project w/ a interview, paper, pwrpt &amp; recording. 2 much even 4 a grad class"
3372,954272,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Walton was a good professor if you're talking about lectures, interacting with students, etc. But the way she does her class isn't the best. The tests were hard for me, there's 4 essays (in APA format), and you get points off for not participating in class. If you want to pass easily, look elsewhere. Marketing electives shouldn't be this hard."
3373,954272,4.0,4.0,"Dr. W is a good teacher. At first, most of us were confused about the projects we were assigned. Talk to her and ask questions, she will clear everything right up. Some people didn't like her high expectations. She expects thorough work. She's great, just don't procrastinate! You will leave that class skilled in the subject taught!"
3374,954272,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Walton has good intentions but she lectures without visuals and never has a guided lecture. Also, she is very unorganized although it may seem otherwise."
3375,954272,5.0,3.0,Dr. Walton is knowledgeable and has significant experience in the PR field. She expects a lot from her students but grades fairly.
3376,2772902,5.0,1.0,easiest professor you will ever take!!! tests are online and not proctored
3377,954279,5.0,4.0,"Dr. C is amazing. You definitely have to put in the work. She wants you to learn, and I give her the credit for helping me to become a better writer. Love love love her!"
3378,954279,5.0,3.0,"She is very caring! The grades consisted of 1 3page paper (10%), 1 5page paper (15%), 1 10page paper (25%), an exit interview where she asks about what you want to do after graduation and tries to help you (5%), 1 paper presentation (5%), in class assignments, attendance, library lab, and quizzes. She tries very hard to make sure you do well!  "
3379,954279,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Clagget is very tough, but a WONDERFUL teacher. I learned more from her than most teachers. You have 3 papers, and you get two tries on the first 2. Lots of reading of novels, short stories, etc. She is also hilarious! This class is very hard, but she taught me so much."
3380,954279,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Claggett took a subject that is challenging for most students and turned it into something fun and inspirational. This class is still difficult and you really need to study for a good grade, but having Dr. Claggett as a professor makes you want to do better. Fun activities throughout and you are always prepared for homework and tests."
3381,954279,5.0,4.0,"I'm an English major, and even this class was a little challenging! Lots of class/student-run discussion, and very funny at times too! Just be ready to read some long poems and present some drawn-out analysis."
3382,954279,5.0,5.0,Dr. C was intelictually stimulating. Must take class of 2012!!!!  UNREAL
3383,954279,4.5,3.0,A little bit off the wall but that made class more fun.
3384,954279,1.5,5.0,I did not enjoy this class at all.
3385,954279,5.0,5.0,Difficult but worth it. Learned a lot. Would take again.
3386,954279,5.0,4.0,Really great teacher. Lots of class discussion. Expects a lot but you can learn so much from her. Makes class a lot of fun.
3387,954279,5.0,4.0,No Comments
3388,954284,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Haney is an amazing instructor. She loves to help students and is available for help. If I ever had any confusion over something, she would clarify it. Tests and assignments were very clear concerning expectations. This is the second course I took from Dr. Haney, and I can proudly say that she was the same great instructor."
3389,954284,5.0,3.0,Fantastic professor. Passionate about the topics which makes her classes easy to learn.
3390,954284,5.0,3.0,Dr Haney is probably my favorite Geoscience professor at MSU. I have taken several of her class es and her test/quizzes are not hard but also not super easy. She is quick to respond to emails and is a laid back professor that is passionate about geosciences.
3391,954284,5.0,3.0,"This professor is WONDERFUL!!! Amazing teacher, really wants everyone to succeed and pass. I wish I could learn from her for every class!!"
3392,954284,5.0,2.0,"Good teacher. Her quizzes are easy, her tests were above average in difficulty. She taught useful things and things I am able to use everyday. I have a job in env geology and her class helped me understand impacts of things rarely thought of. Even though the class was easy, the goal is to learn, which I did."
3393,954284,5.0,3.0,Excellent teacher. Quick response to requests and emails. Grades fairly. Goes to great lengths to help students.
3394,954284,5.0,1.0,"She's great. You know exactly what is expected of you, grades fairly, responds to e-mails quickly, lectures are good. Would recommend."
3395,954284,4.5,1.0,Does a great job explaining things.  Also nice to look at ;)
3396,954284,5.0,2.0,Very good teacher. Explains everything really well and offers good notes if you come to class everyday. Made the otherwise hard material easy. I have lab with the students of the other Geo teacher and I always have a much easier time with the notes that Dr. Haney has given me.
3397,954284,5.0,2.0,"She is a GREAT teacher and lobs what she does, and tries to make you like it too. Lab is so easy, test are easy if you do a little light studying, and she is always willing to help you in or out of class. My first year there she made me feel at home"
3398,954284,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher, really knows alot about the topics you discuss.  But, you must understand the applications involved.  Also, not bad to look at either. :)"
3399,954284,4.5,4.0,"Excellent teacher; really knows her stuff. If you don't understand something, she is happy to help. Her tests have a lot of application questions so make sure to study!"
3400,2781100,3.0,4.0,Make sure to do homework as it is worth almost as much as a test grade. Test are very difficult.
3401,2781100,3.0,5.0,Animal Breeding is difficult. Test are mostly applied questions. Don't just memorize definitions. Homeworks count for basically a test together. Don't blow them off. Exams are mainly what you do in lab. If he says an assignment takes 1 hour give yourself 3. Be prepared to memorize a lot of similar formulas. Don't take this with other hard classes. 
3402,2781100,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Smith is an acquired taste. I love him and his lectures, but if you aren't already very interested in breeding and genetics this is going to be a doozy if you don't find a way to apply yourself. His tests are difficult but it is because they test your understanding, not your memorization skills. Great info for students actually into Ag industry"
3403,2781100,5.0,2.0,"I am in his class as I write this, and we looked his ratings up. There was no ratings, and I felt bad he didn't have any. So, I'm here to tell you that if you study, you'll be fine :) ... at least for beef cattle science. You've got to really pay attention, study, and do the homework to do well in Breeding. But still, you'll be fine. He's awesome. "
3404,2453423,3.0,4.0,Very passionate about the subject however there are no study guides and his test can be super hard. Everything is from the notes but you really have to study a week in advance to even make a B.
3405,2592690,5.0,4.0,"Straightforward professor and class. All materials that are on tests are also in lectures and on slides that are accessible outside of class.  His sample tests are accurate. This is the first tough class on the Civil Engineering flowchart, so it feels harder than it is.  He is very helpful when questions are asked and will clarify unclear concepts."
3406,2592690,4.0,4.0,"I've heard him be called inaccurate slurs outside of class because his lectures are boring. 
My brother in class, you're in environmental engineering issues. It's all boring. It's alkalinity. Numbers simulating population growth with logarithms. It's all boring. 
Overall, he does a great job trying to get people interested. Listen to the podcast"
3407,2592690,1.0,5.0,There is a podcast about the environment weekly and a pop quiz almost weekly about the podcast and slides. Slides are read off and little explanation and examples often skip steps without detail.
3408,2592690,1.0,5.0,The only professor for the mandatory class.
3409,2592690,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ben is pretty great! If you ask pretty much anyone in the civil department how he is, they will probably give you a negative response. The class isn’t easy by any means, but if you study, you’ll be completely okay. He does give pop quizzes so you have to keep up with the information. Definitely get to know him outside of class"
3410,2592690,5.0,4.0,Tests can be tough but are definetly manageable if you study. He gives previous semestr exams as reference and they are pretty similar to what you will see. He&#39;s very accessible outside of class and understanding if anything comes up too. Overall one of the more iconic professors in the civil department if I do say so myself.
3411,2592690,3.0,4.0,"I thought this class sounded easy but its mostly chemistry. You'll need to study for this class weekly. He gives pop quizzes almost every week based off the lectures and an hour long podcast. Homework also comes from the lectures, but tests are much harder even tho he gives a sample test. Gives 3 tests worth 75% so not much room for error."
3412,2592690,4.0,4.0,"Definitely a solid choice for professor. He was very fair in everything he did. He gave us plenty of chances to boost our grade, and even negotiated with the class on their test scores. He went above and beyond for the final. He gave us more information than he needed to and added a bonus question at the end worth 40 test points to boost averages."
3413,2592690,1.0,4.0,this guy SUCKS!!! He teaches you by showing you slides and doing the problems without explaining. He also has a monotone voice and is a slow talker. He makes you want to scream HURRY UP!!!! WE dont HAVE TIME FOR THIS!!! He also makes you listen to a weekly podcast and makes problems for it on pop quizzes on Mondays!!! DONT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!!
3414,2592690,1.0,4.0,"The class was online. Would not take it again because I had to teach myself THE WHOLE course. He posted every lecture for the year on the first day. Was a hy-flex (hybrid) class taught like it was Asynchronous. Haha, I am not even kidding. The teacher would go onto chegg and post incorrect answers to questions."
3415,2453438,4.0,2.0,"This class included a lot of work but it was very easy. The professor was very accessible outside of class and answered emails asap. My textbook was backordered so I wasn't able to turn in some work on time, however she did not count my work as late. The tests were easy."
3416,2453438,5.0,1.0,This class was fun and it wasn't overwhelming! She is very fair when it comes to grading and she even let you complete any assignments that you may have missed way after the due date. Definitely an amazing professor to have when you're forced to do online.
3417,2453438,5.0,2.0,Great choice for Music Appreciation. Easy class if you just follow along. Tests are online. Would recommend.
3418,1429438,5.0,1.0,"I absolutely loved him! One of the easiest teachers I've ever had. Just come to class, and there's no way you can't make an A."
3419,1429438,5.0,3.0,He's amazing!  Hilarious and extremely enthusiastic.  He'll do anything to help you and make sure that you get the material.  He cares a lot.  I'd recommend him to everyone.
3420,954304,4.0,4.0,"The tests are hard but their are a lot of opportunities to recover from them. You got a design project, a speech, and she lets us rework a bad test at home.  She is also really nice and good lookin too."
3421,954304,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Walters is a phenomenal teacher. She is so smart and funny. The class itself is pretty tough, being a junior level Chemical Engineering class, but she knows her stuff and is fair when it comes to tests and homework. Pay attention in class. "
3422,954304,4.5,3.0,"This class isn't easy, but Dr. Walters is incredibly brilliant. More importantly, she actually cares about her students. She grades her own tests and homeworks because she wants to see what her students are having trouble with. Very accessible outside of class, and is very, VERY helpful to talk to."
3423,954304,2.0,4.0,"Very difficult class. Heat Transfer was a bugbear with this professor; she did not teach the material, but ran through the notes in a blur and expected you to get everything from the text. Unfortunately, not everyone learns this way. Try actually teaching. Would greatly benefit by sticking to research."
3424,954304,1.0,5.0,shes not very good.and shes rude.avoid her
3425,2584515,2.0,3.0,"He is a nice person, but has a very thick accent that sometimes can be hard to understand. The class focuses on circuit theory so be prepared. Only 2 tests in the class with one final so be prepared. If you are a very disciplined person who is able to study with no problem then he is the professor for you. He is accessible outside of class/"
3426,2584515,4.0,3.0,Easily one of my favorite professors! Dr. Samiappan was very helpful and well knowledged on the class material. The tests were very true to the source material. Some of his questions were harder than homework but nothing that couldn't be accomplished with studying. I would highly recommend him to another student.
3427,528326,1.5,5.0,She is the worst teacher I've ever had at MSU.  All she does during the class is reading slides.  I have to go over my textbook and try to learn everything by myself.
3428,528326,2.5,4.0,"One of the worst teacher I have ever had!!  Her tests are not like anything she does in class, and everyone fails.  She does not teach, she reads her slides, she is bad.."
3429,528326,1.5,4.0,I hardly learned anything from this lady. All she does is read off powerpoint slides and do obscure derivations of physics equations. The only thing that saved me was the massive curve on every test. She had to have it because over half the class failed every single test!
3430,954311,4.0,3.0,"Dr. B is great. She usually gets grades back within a week or so and she is very easy to approach and ask questions. The material for ergo is a bit easier than other engineering classes. She does give pop quizzes but she usually puts a small bonus if you know how State, Arkansas, or VTech did at football the weekend before."
3431,954311,4.5,3.0,"While her tests may be a tad lengthy, they go over EXACTLY what she went over. If you have ANY question, she will answer it. She is really nice and cares. I sent her an email asking about concept I was confused on, and she brought many practice problems to class for the review. GREAT TEACHER!"
3432,954311,3.0,1.0,"Her class is easier than the average engineering fare.  The problem is that the tests were super long.  They weren't hard, just very long.  Most people just barely finished on time."
3433,954311,2.0,5.0,IE-3913
3434,954311,1.0,5.0,Do not take for this class tries to work off powerpoints and is to into this is the way to find the answer when in fact there are many ways to do the same problem...
3435,954313,4.0,3.0,This professor is very easy to work with and truly wants her students to succeed.
3436,954313,5.0,3.0,"Literally my all time favorite professor. So helpful, kind, and understanding. Will do anything for a student to make sure they succeed. Her class is fairly easy as well. Came out with As both times I had her."
3437,954313,4.0,3.0,"Mrs. Grant is one of the sweetest people I know. She cares a lot about your mental health and will excuse you from class if you let her know what is going on. But, she can be very scatterbrained. She usually ends up talking about her dogs or something else. Tests are online and not that much of your grade because you do have small projects."
3438,954313,5.0,2.0,she gives you everything you need for the test which are online! attendance mandatory to get material but she's super cool if you miss for a reason. just email her! class is chill and you don't take many notes. let's out early or cancels sometimes. knows we all check out early for holidays so has a light day or cancels before. great teacher!!
3439,954313,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Erin is the most genuine instructor I have ever met. She was very caring and helped me with anything I needed outside of class. Her class is easy as long as you show up, she does take roll. One group project. Tests are online. Seldom gives homework."
3440,954313,5.0,3.0,"She is strict on attendance, and no cell phones are allowed, but she is really helpful and if you seem interested she can tell and your grade will reflect it."
3441,954315,2.0,4.0,"Super super nice lady! She isn't a bad professor at all, but I don't like her retention notes. They didn't help me at all and were pretty much useless for when I studied. Attendance isn't counted as a grade, but she does only provide lecture notes during the lecture. "
3442,954315,2.0,3.0,"Overall would not take her again because she uses a weird way of teaching. It's very difficult to ""relearn"" how to learn something when in college after years of being taught a certain way. Her syllabus is crazy as well as how grades count for the class. "
3443,954315,4.0,2.0,As long as you look over retention notes you will succeed in her class she is very nice and explains her letters very well 
3444,954315,3.0,1.0,"Felt like I was treated like a kindergartener because she had us repeat words over and over, but class was easy"
3445,954315,5.0,2.0,She is a great professor and I feel like she truly cares about each student doing well and succeeding. Attendance isn't mandatory but in order to do well in the class you need the retention notes which you fill out in class. All of the tests were online on canvas and we only had one in person quiz but if you studied it was very easy!
3446,954315,5.0,2.0,"Best prof ever!! very passionate about her job, and it really shows. If you show up to class and fill out the retention notes you will thrive"
3447,954315,2.0,3.0,"if the class size was smaller and people actually participated, i think the class would have been more enjoyable."
3448,954315,1.0,3.0,"Worst professor Ive had. Shes a b**** wouldnt recommend at all. I asked her politely if she could put 2 chapters of lecture videos up, and she sent back a rude message ending with I suggest you try to fill out the notes from your memory. Keep in mind this is a final exam, but luckily someone was nice enough to send them to me and I passed."
3449,954315,5.0,2.0,Holly Wiley is amazing. Super understanding and helpful. Class was an easy A if you just complete the notes that she gives you.
3450,954315,5.0,1.0,Interesting class. Easy if you try.
3451,954315,5.0,2.0,"Holly Wiley is one of my favorite professors at State. She provides supplemental notes that you bring to class with you with blanks that you fill in during the lecture. Tests are online, easy A. No textbook."
3452,954315,5.0,1.0,"She is a great teacher! The class is easy and interesting. The quizzes online are graded for effort, and she gives a multiple choice midterm and final. Class is officially 3 times a week, but we only meet 2 times a week. I highly recommend this class and Dr. Wiley."
3453,954315,5.0,2.0,This class is super easy if you do the retention notes and go to class. She's energetic and really nice. Class was technically twice a week but she only required us to come once a week.
3454,954315,5.0,2.0,"I loved her class.  She made the information interesting (as interesting as medical terms can be...) and was always a cheerful spirit.  Willing to help you out if she can, but attendance is mandatory.  Class only once a week though."
3455,954315,5.0,2.0,"I took her for Medical Terminology. She's quite easy! Come to class, listen to the lecture & copy the powerpoint & you'll do fine! Try not to miss more than 3 classes because it'l effect you in the long run!"
3456,954315,5.0,1.0,No Comments
3457,528332,4.0,3.0,"Her lectures are fun and entertaining; however, her tests can be hard. She does give a lot of bonus points though!"
3458,528332,3.0,4.0,"Dr. MIllea is a fun teacher, however the tests are difficult and the study guides are hard as well. The final exam was not about what we learned in the class but on articles and questions that she gave us."
3459,528332,2.0,4.0,"Rarely stays on topic. Unclear notes, this hurts when it comes time to take test. Hard study guides. Open ended questions on the test. Is cool is class but can be short (rude) over emails and in class when asking questions. ( Had this teacher at East Carolina University)"
3460,528332,2.0,3.0,"Not really sure what to study when it's time to take a test, all over the place, can do whatever during class, have in class assignments for a completion grade"
3461,528332,5.0,4.0,"She is very fun and an amazing teacher, I would take her again. You have to go to class and you have to study and do your homework but you really do learn a lot and she explains things very well."
3462,528332,2.5,4.0,"She even said that economics was boring.  After the first test, I went to her office to ask for help and she said that my grades would get better and the tests would get easier.  She was wrong.  The lectures are confusing and the book doesn't help any."
3463,528332,5.0,1.0,She is awesome.
3464,528332,3.0,2.0,"She is a very well informed teacher. She can elaborate on details which make sense to her students. However, she is spastic and rambles often! She talks extremely fast and is frequently asked to repeat herself. The only concerns one should have is to not leave her class unannounced, LEARN THE GRAPHS, and make note of the problems she repeats."
3465,528332,5.0,4.0,"She's a tough cookie but don't let that crumble you! She's very helpful and if you act like you give a CRAP she will give you a good grade! Get to know her, go to her office, show interest in the class. She's president of the econ committee!"
3466,528332,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Millea has a very engaging style of teaching.  I had her bright and early in the morning and she was always eager to teach.  One of the most helpful professors I've ever had, and she seems to really care about the farewell of her students."
3467,528332,4.5,4.0,"Great teacher. Tests are difficult. Be sure and go to class event though it isn't mandatory. After a test, be sure and visit her and go over what you've missed. She's really good about making everything understandable. I would love to take another one of her classes."
3468,528332,4.5,3.0,"you will walk away with a lot from this class. her tests can be difficult if you never go to class, but you should easily be able to pull out a C or B.. i barely studied and got a B..."
3469,528332,4.5,2.0,"She goes really fast and one of the tests was over like 7 chapters, but she is more than willing to help you out if you go by her office.  She even has study sessions before every test.  The tests are quite difficult because they are all short answer, so just make sure you take good notes and remember EVERYTHING she says."
3470,528332,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Millea is tough, but clear, and her tests involve a lot of definitions, but they arent hard. Her teaching style encourages you to be involved in class and helps you to remember what you learn. Overall, a good econ. teacher."
3471,528332,4.5,4.0,Awesome teacher but pretty tough.  Will help in anyway possible you just have to be able to help yourself.
3472,528332,4.5,2.0,"I had her for Macroeconomics, one of the few teachers I've had who still teaches with the blackboard instead of reading those dang powerpoint slides! People seemed to hate her short-answer tests but I didn't have a problem with them."
3473,528336,1.0,2.0,"If youre looking to learn Cal 4, this is not the guy. Never rated someone a 1 star before. The class is super easy because he gives you the test. He puts no effort into the class. Easily making a high A but know nothing compared to other classes."
3474,528336,5.0,3.0,"If you want an easy A for Calculus IV, take Robert Smith. Although I had absolutely no idea what was going on throughout the class, he gives a study guide the class before the exam. If you study the study guide and memorize how to do each problem, you will make a 95+ on each test. Also, he is a very easy grader."
3475,528336,3.0,3.0,"Most of us had no idea what was going on most of the time in this class and throughout the lectures. However, the class before each test we got a review sheet which was almost exactly like the test. So basically if you want an A, show up for review day and memorize how to work each problem for the test and this class will be your easiest."
3476,528336,5.0,3.0,"He's extremely nice and VERY smart. His lectures can be fast-paced and confusing, but he'll always stop if you have a question. The tests aren't very difficult because he gives you a study guide the class period before the exam that is EXTREMELY similar to the exam itself. Attendance and homework are not mandatory."
3477,528336,1.0,5.0,"Lectures are not helpful. You have to look at the homework to even know what the section is called. He gives no back ground information. He does give partial credit, but sparingly. I do not recommend! Your GPA will go down if you are not retaking the class. I put in nearly 7 hours a day outside of lecture to teach myself the material."
3478,528336,4.0,1.0,Dr. Smith is a brilliant man so be prepared to be introduced to really difficult material beyond the scope of your course that you will never be tested on. His tests are incredibly easy and he gives generous partial credit. He is also very helpful in office hours and the homework definitely pads your grade. Highly recommend.
3479,528336,4.0,3.0,Dr. Smith moves really fast through the material but if you stop him to ask a question he will slow down after explaining it. He explains things really well he just doesn't take the time to get into it in class. Go to his office hours if you don't understand something. He is nice helpful and understanding.
3480,528336,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Smith is an excellent mathematician but I would not recommend his course if you are only taking it to get credit. For those who are very fond of maths, like myself, he is perfect. Expect to be introduced to material far beyond the scope of your course, but not to be tested on it. "
3481,528336,4.5,1.0,"Really good professor. He's crazy smart. Sometimes what he teaches in class goes over my head, but if you ask a question, he'll make sure what he's teaching is clear to you. His review (straight out of the book) is pretty much exactly what's on the test. The review questions are definitely harder than what's on the test."
3482,528336,3.5,2.0,"Took linear algebra with him. Sometimes in class when he goes over theory, he goes way over your head, but he always makes sure you understand real examples before the tests. Doesn't try to trip you up on the tests, uses easy numbers to make sure you understand the concepts."
3483,528336,3.0,4.0,"For Linear Algebra, he doesn't explain the material very well, he just works problems quickly with little elaboration on the details.  Then his first test was only 4 questions based on 7 sections from the book.  Extremely harsh if you ask me.  Missing one concept out of many could easily grant you a C on the first test."
3484,528336,2.0,5.0,"The man is genius! But coming into this course after taking Calculus in a small high school, I struggled for a B. He taught on a level above me. His tests are not hard, but he likes to use proofs. He also teaches a lot of theorems. If you are more likely to learn by repetition and numbers, don't take him. If you like theorems, he's the guy for you!"
3485,528336,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Smith is wicked smart. I had him for Honors Cal I. Big mistake. I really did not learn anything. Most of the people in the class did well since his test were not that hard, but most of what he did in class had nothing to do with the material. He enjoys writing on the chalk board and probably would not notice if someone got up and left the room."
3486,528336,3.5,2.0,"Honors calculus I and II with this guy were unbelievably fun for me (math major).  If you like theory, jump in.  If not, it's dangerous."
3487,528336,4.0,3.0,Very Intelligent teacher with easy tests and can help if you ask for it.  The class will come off as hard and never never take an honors class with this guy.  The regular classes are easy though.
3488,528336,3.0,5.0,"Made the mistake of taking him for Honors Cal III. DO NOT take him unless you LOVE math. He will prove theorems all day and not show you how to work a single problem. Expects you to remember every obscure identity from your entire math career. Very nice and willing to help outside of class, though."
3489,2633686,2.0,4.0,"Professor Ampong means well, but is not the best at teaching business calculus. The biggest issue is he tends to work too fast to understand and copy down at the same time so you have to choose one or the other. The downfall isn't as much him as it is the class setup. You get no partial credit on tests and have to take the quizzes on computers."
3490,2633686,3.0,3.0,"We basically learned the materials through videos before class and then he reviewed the videos in class. It was tough for my learning style because I needed the topics explained to me more thoroughly. He also goes reeaaalllly fast. However, he had regular office hours and was very accessible. Put in some work and you should be ok."
3491,2633686,3.0,4.0,"He's very accessible outside of class. I'm not the best at math, but he wants the best for all his students &amp; encouraging. He does have quite an accent though."
3492,528344,4.0,5.0,She is a good teacher but you are required to put forth the effort of trying to learn the material or at least pre read before she teaches the material. She trys to make the class interesting with props sometimes. Go to her office for help anytime!
3493,528344,4.0,4.0,I think she is a good teacher if you show you are trying to do the work. You have to study for this class and review the material on your own time. She can't force the material down your throat if you don't get it when she presents it
3494,528344,3.0,4.0,"Took her over the summer, first test was easy, made an a then studying the same way for the second test failed miserably. She comes out of nowhere with the test problems...significantly more difficult than anything else youve ever seen before the test. I will say that if you go to her for help I think she helps a lot, but for sure avoid if you can!"
3495,528344,1.0,5.0,"She is horrible. The worst teacher I've ever had. Avoid this woman at all costs. You have been warned. Her homework is tough and the tests are even harder. You will have to teach yourself to do well, so get acquainted with your textbook."
3496,528344,2.0,4.0,"Can't teach. Interested about the material, which I learned on my own."
3497,528344,2.5,4.0,She can't teach. She expects you to come to her office hours to learn how to do the homework. She grades very hard.
3498,528344,4.5,4.0,"Had her for statics, tests are HARD but you learn a lot from her. Went out of her way time and again to help students outside of class. Shows you exactly how to work problems, very straightforward. I liked her teaching style."
3499,1126362,4.0,4.0,Lectures are dense but are posted so its easy to go back through them. Can be a little all over the place when working out problems but its not too hard to understand. Tests are based on hw and in-class problems. Tests arent graded that hard. Attendance is a must because if you miss one lecture its easy to get confused with later topics.
3500,1126362,4.0,4.0,"Great professor, a but fast during class, but he encourages questions. Hes also very accessible outside of class. His tests are just like the homework assignments and lecture practice questions."
3501,1126362,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Dutta is great. Despite his ominously foreign name, he is very easy to understand. He explains the concepts well. He can be a bit fast at times, but he encourages questions and is very happy to answer them if you get lost. He is also very accessible outside of class and very willing to help, even outside of his office hours. Tests are very fair"
3502,1126362,1.0,4.0,Only take if required
3503,1126362,3.0,5.0,"Good teacher, easy to pay attention, easy to understand, interesting lectures.  Bad grader,  unclear criteria /rubric, inconsistent , Curved Class"
3504,1126362,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Dutta is a very good professor. He teaches well, has high but reasonable expectations and goes out of his way to help you."
3505,1126362,3.0,5.0,No Comments
3506,2535398,4.0,3.0,"Undergrads have a 3-5 page paper due every week, but he reduced the number of weekly papers when we all talked with him about it. The students do the lectures and we get graded on our powerpoints and how well our presentation is. He's very understanding; his syllabus says no late work accepted but he will accept with an appropriate excuse"
3507,2551784,3.0,2.0,"Easy class. Can be boring at sometimes listening to her lecture. Grades include 10 weekly assignments that are very easy, 4 exams with a drop grade, attendance (you can miss 3 classes without deduction of points), and PRP credits (you have to participate in 7.5 hours of psy research studies). Just have to study definitions for the exams."
3508,2551784,5.0,2.0,I really enjoyed her class. She gives a lot of examples so you know for sure what she's talking about and makes lectures pretty enjoyable. She lets you miss 3 classes without points taken off and she also drops your lowest test grade. Highly recommend!!
3509,1560556,4.5,1.0,"Plant Geo, easy class if you show up and pay attention. She keeps it interesting even though most are powerpoints"
3510,954349,4.0,2.0,"She is slightly scatter brained, but you can tell she is passionate about her job. Attendance was not mandatory, but you can tell a difference in your grade if you do not go. She gives numerous extra credit opportunities. She is very accessible outside of class as well. Buy the book, it helps because her tests are taken straight from the text."
3511,954349,2.5,3.0,I agree she is hot.  That doesnt make up for the fact that you MUST make sure she does her part by recording test scores.  She was missing two of mine and I had to search the tests myself to prove her wrong.  These are people's grades... please try a bit harder...
3512,954349,5.0,3.0,very hard to concentrate due her hotness but she is extremely helpful and nice. very knowledgable basically runs the insurance dept.
3513,954348,1.5,4.0,Ridiculous Teacher. Probably the worst I've had! Never covers any material. Material on tests was out of the blue. Annoying voice and constantly wants to talk about herself and her kids.
3514,954348,2.0,3.0,"She's funny and nice, but I hated her class.  Her teaching methods just don't agree with me.  Somehow I ended up pulling off an A due to her massive curve.  I made lower than 70's on all her tests yet still pulled it off."
3515,954348,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Campbell-Smith's class is awesome.  She gives you plenty of opportunities for bonus points.  Her tests are pretty hard, but she lets you use your materials (book, outline, etc.) the last 30 minutes of the test.  I highly recommend taking one of her classes.  She's a cool person, and is very nice.  She's also hot."
3516,2551794,5.0,2.0,"After taking Intro to Gender Studies with Mr. Tesch this past semester, he was no doubt my favorite professor I've ever had. He's super cool and very laid back. Average amount of homework, interesting lectures, and usually lets the class out early. Advice: KEEP UP WITH WEEKLY JOURNALS! Overall 10/10 professor!"
3517,2551794,5.0,1.0,"He was definitely one of the best teachers I've ever had. He treats us like actual adults and his lectures were always very interesting and funny. He grades very easily, and while I wouldn't recommend skipping his class, it is not required to pass."
3518,2551794,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Tesch is AMAZING and a fresh breath of air in a world full of strict professors. It's evident that he cares about what he talks about and makes the somewhat heavy topics feel lightweight. This class is laidback, and he thrives off class participation, so feel free to speak your mind. LIttle to no homework or reading is required too."
3519,2551794,5.0,2.0,Brian is amazing! His lectures are are funny and super informative. His tests are open note and open book (but like dont get the book bro). Literally one of the easiest classes youll ever take. You can barely pay attention and still pass. You can usually tell when something is important and you can write it down. He posts all the PowerPoints too!
3520,2551794,5.0,2.0,"he is super funny. def one of the best professors in the criminology department. he lets you out super early. lectures are interesting. grades come from weekly assignments that are easy 100s if you try. test are online and open note. test was not super easy but, I still made a 90 on the first one. I would take again. going to miss not having him!"
3521,2551794,5.0,2.0,"A really enjoyable class and relaxed teaching style. He makes you want to come to class. The tests were easy, but there aren't a lot of grades so one bad grade will bring you down. Also really good about answering emails."
3522,2551794,5.0,2.0,He's a very funny professor. He will normally let you out early and he truly does try to make the lectures as painless as possible. Allows makeup assignments and gives a lot of extra credit opportunities.
3523,684019,4.5,4.0,"Unless you are majoring in music DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She is a very sweet lady and all but 1.) She does not post power points online 2.) Number one would not be a problem if she would not flip through her stuff so fast but she does 3.)Nonmusic majors are on the verge of failing that class. Trust me, I'm a 4.0 student & I find it hard. Good luck."
3524,684019,5.0,2.0,"Ms Johns is a really good teacher. She teaches with a very professional and orderly fashion. She encompasses all the aspects of the subject that you could imagine. Her tests are relativly easy, if you read the book and take good notes. She is a very professional and interesting teacher."
3525,1593331,5.0,3.0,"THE BEST of THE BEST. 
She is such an angel and will make you laugh non stop. She genuinely cares about you, your life, and your academics. As long as you give it your best she will be nothing but helpful. TAKE NOTES. "
3526,684022,5.0,4.0,"She makes you work for it, but she's one of the most skilled and helpful proffs you will come across. She genuinely cares about you as a whole, not just your value as a musician. She will go out of her way to help your acheive success."
3527,1626115,4.5,3.0,"The tests were hard, but the curve was fair. Se was also happy to help students during office hours."
3528,1626115,4.5,3.0,"The tests may have been hard, but the curve was more than fair. She was also eager to help students outside of class."
3529,1626115,2.0,5.0,"She is hot but tough. Helpful but her homeworks and tests are hard. Never copy from solution manual, coz' she checks those too, and she' tough on plagiarism."
3530,1994756,1.0,5.0,One of the worst teachers I have ever had. Absolutely terrible.
3531,1994756,3.0,2.0,"She is young and fun, but she requires you to really put in effort. Her class in enjoyable and I never dreaded going. "
3532,2748440,5.0,2.0,Great instructor for Mods and manufacturing. The only problem was in the lectures he would blow through 1 or 2 chapters of material making it impossible to keep up. Outside of that he is a very lenient grader who rewards those that participate. Be prepared to spend some time going over the notes and filling in stuff you missed.
3533,2748440,5.0,2.0,"Jose was great for SML. He focused more on us doing the labs in person and did not care much about the lab reports. If we gave an effort and turned in something presentable we would get an A on the labs. The lowest lab grades were still high B's. The post labs are full lab reports, so take a while and are challenging but his grading makes it easy."
3534,2674732,2.0,4.0,"I wouldn't consider Dr. Hongjoo Rhee to be a terrible instructor, although his lectures/handwriting can be a bit hard to follow. What bothers me most is his unreasonably long, repetitive homework assignments that take hours. It often feels like I'm being punished and doing &quot;writing lines&quot; when I'm doing the same calculation over and over."
3535,2191406,1.0,5.0,Essentially absent from the online course. Didn't even realize the professor was a woman because the lectures are all videos of some other guy from several years ago. Ridiculous amount of homework and extremely math-heavy for a SURVEY of chemistry course.
3536,2191406,1.0,5.0,She is absolutely horrible do not take her!! Took her online chem course and there are no good videos explaining how to do her stuff she just expects you to know how to do it. Would give her a 0 if I could needs to be replaced.
3537,2191406,1.0,5.0,Does not even teach the material or supply you with how to work the homework. She just says look in the text book. If at all possible take anything related to chemistry at a junior college. Gives post videos of another guy summarizing the chapter.
3538,2191406,4.0,4.0,great teacher. do not buy the actual book just buy the access code
3539,2191406,1.0,4.0,First day of the class and was basically accused of cheating. She said it was suspicious that I could finish two homework assignments in under three hours. They were 20 to 30 question homework assignments where 90% of them are multiple choice. I took AP Chem and still remember alot but It was suspicious that I answered 3 questions in less than 3min
3540,2191406,1.0,4.0,"I took this class my freshman year, now a junior. Since then my review has been taken off of this website Im guessing by the company because of the choice words used to describe this horrible woman. This class is awful. She doesnt respond to emails regularly and makes you feel stupid when she does. She is the worst professor at MSU."
3541,2191406,2.0,3.0,"Very hard to contact outside of class. Expect to send 2+ emails before receiving a response. Homework assignments were large (often 30-50 questions) and were once a week, plus quizzes and exams. Often used videos of other instructors explaining the material, never her. Does not answer questions well. I felt dumb asking her a question."
3542,2060339,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, she remembers your name if you have ever spoke to her more than two or three times. Something most her students want to do. Super nice and polite. She definitely has a eagerness to teach and teach in a useful way. My class was graded on 7 mini tests and no homework. She gave a bunch of bonus points. 10/10 Take Haley Brown. "
3543,2060339,5.0,3.0,She was a really good teacher. No homework or textbooks or quizzes; just 5 tests. I definitely learned a lot in this class. Tests present exactly what was in the lectures.
3544,2060339,4.5,3.0,"You've gotta study for this class, if not you'll struggle. The test are fairly difficult and can be lengthy if you don't know the material. She gives you really good examples and gets you involved in the material so that it'll help stick.  She understands that law can be ""dry"" so she tends to let you out of class early. Overall I recommend her!"
3545,1921080,1.0,4.0,"Never responds to emails, difficult to communicate it otherwise, generally rude"
3546,1921080,2.0,4.0,"Mrs. Baker was just an okay teacher. I know the class was large, but she was not very personable and was hard to reach outside of class. She would never respond to my emails and it was hard to stay engaged with the material. There were only two tests and that was pretty much all the grading. Go to class. There are in class quizzes for grades too."
3547,1921080,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Baker isn't a bad professor. But her lectures do not match her exams whatsoever. You can barely get through lectures with her because she constantly drags on with topics that just makes this class boring! She gives extra credit points here and there. She's not a bad professor, just hate her teaching style!"
3548,1921080,1.0,5.0,"She has 4 tests and 8 chapter tests. Even though she does not require attendance, her tests are based off her lectures. You dont go, you wont make higher than a b unless your just that good. She hardly EVER responds to emails. Chapter tests dont count for much so youre basing your grade off 4 tests. Dont take her. Btw: tests are face to face."
3549,1921080,2.0,2.0,Reads off power points. Has you answer like 2-5 questions every few classes as a quiz grade. Tests are online.
3550,1921080,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Baker never responded to my emails and acted annoyed if I tried to ask her something in person. She was not helpful at all and the tests did not go along with the lectures. I got lucky with all the tests being online, but I don't know if that is how she always does it."
3551,1921080,1.0,3.0,"Professor Baker does not care for her students. She is rude and inaccessible outside of class. The class isnt that difficult, but her lectures and textbook dont necessarily match the exams. She uses Campusknot daily, and this will determine your final grade. GO TO CLASS and take the quizzes and polls; and you should pass."
3552,1921080,3.0,4.0,"The class was ok. The room was huge so I could barely hear her during class, but she uses PowerPoint so it was alright. Doesn't really respond to emails, and the class was kind of boring. I came out of it with a B, so as long as you do good on tests and quizzes, and show up you should be fine."
3553,1921080,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Baker is a very smart professor, but her class is really hard. Her tests are online, but the wording tends to be very confusing and difficult. Attendance isn't mandatory, but she does either polls or quizzes everyday on campus knot that you can only take if you put in the attendance code in class, so you really can't miss."
3554,1921080,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Baker is not accessible out of class. She will rarely respond to emails, she has never responded to an email from me, but when she has replied to my friends' emails she is very rude. Very boring lecture and do not really learn anything."
3555,1921080,1.0,1.0,"Don't take her class unless youre willing to sit through senseless rambling with absolutely no structure. I didn't learn a single thing and her test made absolutely 0 sense and is one of 3 grades in the class. Reaching her outside of class is literally impossible. Do yourself a favor, don't do it."
3556,1921080,5.0,2.0,took online for american govt. was super easy. one group project during semester other than that it was super easy A
3557,1921080,1.0,4.0,The class was political science needed to complete an RN to BSN degree  the course load is heavy for an online class with a graded discussion and assignment due weekly. It was my first experience with a Political science course and it left a bad taste in my mouth. She has poor communication skills and seems aloof with her answers.
3558,1921080,2.0,1.0,"This was taken during covid, but her class was extremely easy. The big issue was that she was quite rude when I tried to communicate with her, and halfway through the semester she disappeared. Not actually, but no one in the class got an email back for the entire second half of the semester. Weekly quizzes on quizlet, and it was easy at least."
3559,1921080,2.0,4.0,TRY TO TAKE ANOTHER TEACHER if you just need it for credit. she moved her exams to in class and are heavy on the lecture. she doesn't really have a power point with notes she just has a picture or a sentence on the slide and talks for the whole class on that one slide. She does make it 50/50 on the homework. lectures are boring
3560,1921080,3.0,4.0,So you have reading quizzes every week but the exams are lecture based. The study guides don't really help much.. Extremely lecture heavy and they can get interesting sometimes. She's easy to talk to though and she'll answer your questions if you have any.
3561,1921080,2.0,3.0,Everything is online. Tests. Homework. There was no final (thankfully) but she doesn't round-up grades unless you have a _9.5 at the end. Take notes in there (if you can stay awake) because her tests are in the same wordings as the notes. She's not very helpful in office hours either.
3562,1921080,2.0,4.0,"The textbook is online, quizzes and tests are online. The tests are supposed to be lecture based, but they don't always match the lectures. I wrote down everything she said, studied my notes, studied my reading notes and quizzes, and still couldn't make above a C on any of the exams. One bonus is that she cancels class the week of Thanksgiving."
3563,1921080,1.0,4.0,Baker is the worst professor in the department. Do not take her classes at all costs
3564,1921080,5.0,1.0,"American Government with Baker was easy. If you don't do well with taking exams that is okay. Just do all of the homework (online quizzes with unlimited attempts), you can still pass her class easy. Attendance is not mandatory, but you need to attend for the lecture slides, because she will not post them on canvas. The exams are not difficult."
3565,1921080,3.0,1.0,"Great teacher, just a little boring. Beware of extra credit quizzes and pop quizzes. You miss, you dont retake."
3566,1921080,1.0,2.0,Like watching paint dry
3567,1921080,1.0,1.0,Dont take her ... you will learn nothing
3568,1921080,1.0,2.0,Literally the worst class ever. I would rather get into a boxing mach with Rocky Balboa then ever attend one of her classes every again.
3569,1921080,1.0,1.0,probably the most boring class I have ever taken. It was nice that everything was online but she was about as fun as a brick wall.
3570,1921080,5.0,1.0,"TAKE THIS CLASS. She makes attendance a grade, BUT everything you do is online. tests, homework, quizzes and even the final."
3571,1921080,2.0,4.0,"She is very difficult if you do not like to read the textbook. The SI sessions are needed. She tells stories instead of lecturing. She gives extra credit points for certain events on campus and for attending SI, only if 60 different people show up to the review session. Shes a very nice person but if you like note driven classes don't take her!"
3572,1921080,1.0,3.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS WOMAN. This was the most boring class I've ever taken. I had to get up at 8 am to go and listen to her drone on about nothing. Power points don't match the lecture, lecture doesn't match the test. Terrible class."
3573,1921080,5.0,1.0,"Yeah she can be boring, but I was actually interested in the stuff being taught and that's probably why I enjoyed her class. If you just attend class, show that you're interested, and try you'll make an ""A""!"
3574,1921080,1.5,4.0,Very boring. She has a very monotone voice and doesn't really explain anything. When you ask questions or talk at all she gets passive aggressive. Just pass the top hat questions and do semi-fine on the exams and your golden. 
3575,1921080,2.0,3.0,"She is a VERY boring teacher. Every time I went into class I dreaded it. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK, it is a waste of money. Each week you have online exams, she drops 4. Usually very easy exams, just use google and quiz let to find answers. Test: Only 2, lecture basedtophap. Attendance is part of your grade. Not a hard class but boring. "
3576,1921080,1.5,4.0,trails off in every sentence. 2 hour exam every friday night. longgggg and boring lectures 
3577,1511490,4.0,2.0,Great teacher after you get used to her accent.  Works examples through class and answers any and all questions.  Would take her again
3578,1511490,4.0,2.0,She can be difficult to understand but you catch up with her accent fast.  She does problems on the board that are almost identical to the ones on the test.  You do need the book because she assigns homework problems from it.
3579,2641995,5.0,1.0,I can not think of good enough words about Dr. Lindley.  I would simply die for him.  He makes every student feel special. I have told multiple people to take him and they all think the same! TAKE DR. LINDLEY!!!
3580,2641995,5.0,1.0,Dr. Lindley s class is the only class I have ever looked forward to. He is so incredible and gives great feedback on how to improve interviewing. I wish I could take his class over and over again!
3581,2641995,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Lindley is one of the best profs I have ever had. He is caring &amp; makes an effort to truly get to know everyone. His interviewing class has prepared me for the real world, &amp; I looked forward to going to class every day because of him. Not overly challenging, but incredibly beneficial. 1000000/10 recommend taking Dr. Lindley for whatever you can!"
3582,2641995,5.0,1.0,Interviewing with Dr. Lindley is such a fun and helpful class. Low stress and high impact class! 10/10 recommend.
3583,2641995,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lindley is a great professor. His interviewing class taught me so much, and he tailored our last interview to our chosen fields, which was very helpful. He is kind, personable, and gives detailed feedback. He is a preacher but never pushes his religion onto others. He goes out of his way to help students and gave me an extension when I asked."
3584,2011245,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Jordan is a great professor and person. Pathogenic Microbiology is an extremely hard course, but she explains the material well. It is imperative you put in lots of time studying for this course."
3585,2011245,1.0,5.0,This is the hardest class I have ever taken and she did nothing to help her students. She sees us failing and struggling and did nothing to change her ways to help us even a little bit. RIP to me. DO NOT take her. &#55357;&#56899;
3586,2011245,1.0,5.0,Dr. Jordan is the worst professor I've ever had at Mississippi State. She mumbles to herself during lectures and doesn't relay the information to the class. She also reads directly off the slides. She also puts WAY too much information on the slides. Barely had time to study for other classes. Horrible professor. Take literally any one else.
3587,2011245,4.0,3.0,"Heather is a phenomenal teacher in my opinion.  Very sweet and helpful if you go see her outside of class.  She answers any questions you have and does a pretty good job at explaining.  Majority of test questions come from her PowerPoints, the rest from the textbook.  If I could, I'd choose her to teach all of my classes."
3588,2011245,3.0,4.0,"I got an A in lecture. In order to make an A, you MUST supplement the notes with the textbook. The captions under diagrams are very helpful for hard concepts.  There r usually at least 2-3 questions not from the notes. Sometimes she throws ?s out. The info in parenthesis in the notes that seems insignificant is ALWAYS on the exam verbatim. GoodLuck"
3589,2011245,2.0,4.0,Tests are tough and you may run into material that you have not seen. She throws out problems that many people miss. In order to properly study for tests the book is a must have. You will have to work hard for decent lecture grade and hopefully your lab will bring your grade up. Wouldn't recommend her if another instructor is available. 
3590,2011245,4.5,2.0,"Reads off the slides. Notes with blanks in them. If you miss class, its hard to get blanks filled without a friend. Shes very willing to help with very clear (but flexible to your schedule) office hours. Tests are off the notes, but study the diagrams!! Textbook not needed. Pop quizzes usually hinted, lowest one dropped. Very intelligent and nice"
3591,2011246,2.5,2.0,"Teaches off an exorbitant amount of handouts, all of which are outdated. Fill in the blank notes. Extra credit offered, but requires you to work outdoors hard for it. Class may or may not be in the class room, and it'll probably be 20 degreesF when she decides to have an ""outdoor lab"". Very giddy with little useful information. Attendance15 ptday"
3592,1888384,4.5,1.0,He gives a lot of extra credit.
3593,1970316,5.0,3.0,Dr. Fisher is amazing! She is truly one of the best professors in the Communication department. She lays out what she excepts and you can make an A in the course. The cases are recent in her class and she makes them very interesting.
3594,1970316,5.0,4.0,Case problems was a fun class! She makes it interesting but make sure you read the article before class. She grades tough-ish on papers but really make sure you look at the rubric and do EVERYTHING on there.
3595,1970316,4.0,4.0,She a great professor and very knowledgeable about all things PR.
3596,1970316,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fisher is one of a kind. She's super knowledgeable and makes what we're talking about really fun. The class is set up to feel really friendly and is always a discussion. There are no test, one group project, two small assignments, and one solo presentation. Super easy and incredibly laid back class. She means business but she's there to help."
3597,1970316,5.0,2.0,She was wonderful! Our whole class always joked around with her. There were no tests. Every other week you had a quiz and on the other week you had to do an analysis on a notecard but she's a pretty easy grader. There is a yearlong group project and paper but it is not hard. We met four times and made an A. She's very entertaining!
3598,2306193,2.0,3.0,Lecture was absolutely pointless. Plant science was the most boring class.
3599,2306193,5.0,2.0,Great Professor. Thoroughly enjoyed the class.
3600,2306193,2.0,4.0,He is a nice person but his lectures are terribly boring! His tests are far too difficult for a Freshman level Plant Science course. Do NOT recommend!
3601,2306193,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Stewart is a nice guy, but as an instructor it's rough. Freshman level plant class with test averages around 67. The lab along with the class is way too hard. Tests were horribly hard. Online quizzes were impossible. Most boring lecture I've ever sat through. I hope he makes changes in the future."
3602,2510997,3.0,4.0,Sometimes it was hard to understand the material but she does answer all of your questions and she'll even answer your questions during the exams the best way she can. The homework did have A LOT of parts to it but you get multiple attempts. Good luck trying to get outside help though because 10/10 no one knew what I was showing them.
3603,2510997,2.0,1.0,"A very interesting lady. She's very nice and you can tell that she tries to make class interesting and fun, but it just didn't work out in my case. Lectures were pretty boring and monotonously similar. She's disorganized and couldn't really articulate what she was trying to say and left a lot of people confused. Takes forever to grade but lenient."
3604,2207900,5.0,1.0,Dr. Barton really loves biology and wants his students to love it to. He tries his best to make the short class important and he gives good advice and few assignments. He tells you exactly what he needs from you and grades exactly how he says. This class is an easy A and Dr. Barton makes sure you succeed.
3605,2207900,4.0,1.0,This class was very easy and Prof. Barton had good resources for biology majors.
3606,2207900,5.0,1.0,Professor Barton was my favorite out of all of my teachers. He actually teaches things that you can use to better yourself and is quite funny and very understanding.
3607,2207900,5.0,2.0,Professor Barton really cares about what he is teaching. This class was online this semester but he would go out of his way to make it amazing for our class!! Take professor barton!
3608,2740382,5.0,1.0,She was a great teacher! She was caring and knew her material. Would recommend her to any student.
3609,2740382,5.0,1.0,She is a great professor and person. She genuinely cares about you as a person and how you're doing. I hope I have the chance to take her again in the future.
3610,1495214,3.0,4.0,unique
3611,1495214,4.5,2.0,I love her!
3612,1937583,4.0,5.0,She is a great comp 1 teacher and is very specific about what she expects for essays. She is a tough grader but she gives great feedback and advice when you go to her office hours and ask for help. Shes very sweet and understanding if you are clearly trying.
3613,1937583,1.0,5.0,Nice teacher but impossible grader. I took 2 AP English courses in high school and made A's on my essays but this teacher is impossible. Nothing is good enough for her. My first draft and final draft always made the same grade. If you want an A on an essay you better be a professional writer. Good luck if you get this teacher.
3614,1937583,2.0,5.0,"NO NOT TAKE. She's a nice person, but the toughest grader."
3615,1937583,3.0,4.0,"I thought she was a very nice person but she grades very tough for a comp 1 teacher. She definitely won't help if you don't show up to class and is very strict about due dates and having the proper materials, she kicked people out of class multiple times for not having materials. I am a decent writer but could never make above an 80 on an essay."
3616,1937583,1.0,5.0,She graded incredibly hard for a comp 1 teacher. I enjoy writing papers but I never made above a 78 on any paper in her class. Very strict on attendance and class participation. Wouldn't recommend at all.
3617,1937583,4.5,3.0,"She is always willing to help if you don't understand, but your papers have to be very good to get an A.  If you do the little readings she assigns, the pop quizzes are easy grade boosters.  She is really nice, and requires your participation for her class."
3618,1937583,4.5,3.0,"She explains your assignments really well and is very willing to help. In your papers though, she hardly ever gives As. "
3619,1937583,3.5,3.0,She is a nice person overall but a very hard grader. She likes to assign a lot of reading quizzes.
3620,1298609,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Armstrong is a great lecturer. I usually can't focus in classes that read off PowerPoints, she does use them, but she explains everything so well and uses real life situations to describe each slide. You actually need to study for exams, but the class itself is very enjoyable! She's very understanding and you can skip class if you need to."
3621,1298609,5.0,1.0,"As an engineer major I was not expecting to love psychology, but Mrs. Armstrong proved me wrong. She is an excellent prof and made the class very fascinating. While doing so, it was very easy as well. Each test is all M/C and about everything is in notes from class. She is going to as good as it gets if you're looking for a good psych prof option"
3622,1298609,5.0,4.0,"Go to class, most of the test material comes from those. Several test questions come from the textbook (ngl I didn't read it as there were good Quizlets out there). I did well in this class, but I also put in a lot of time studying. She's kind and approachable and was willing to answer ANY questions after class or even somewhere outside of class. "
3623,1298609,5.0,1.0,"This class was super easy, but that may be more about the class content than her teaching. However, you can tell she really cares about your success and is very accessible outside of class. I told her about my research interests and she helped me find a lab that aligned with those, and was excited for me when I got accepted into a lab."
3624,1298609,5.0,2.0,"My 1st semester at MSU I had Dr. Armstrong and she was by far my favorite (I'm a senior now). She is an amazing teacher that really knows her stuff and tests that are very straight forward (I don't understand why people struggle when you just listen and take notes of power points & talking points). Easy A, learned a LOT, and I don't even like kids."
3625,1298609,5.0,2.0,"I loved Mrs. Armstrong! She tries her best to make you understand the material, and always tries to incorporate the importance of certain concepts to real life. She worked as a clinical psychologist for a while which helps her keep her lectures engaging by incorporating her own work experinces into the lecture. "
3626,1298609,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor by far. I never really got bored in her lectures. She shared a lot of her personal experience with the subject, and at the end I felt like I learned a lot. I think you can get by without the textbook, but it helps, and attendance isn't graded but you don't want to miss class. She cares about students and wants you to succeed"
3627,1298609,5.0,3.0,"Armstrong is a great professor and you can tell she is very passionate about what she teaches. She tries really hard to get the class involved, the textbook is very helpful for better understanding and the tests sometimes can have questions she won't go over in class but are in textbook."
3628,1298609,5.0,3.0,"I highly recommend Mrs. Armstrong. She is one of my favorite professors ever. Her class is very engaging, even for those not super interested in psychology. She is always willing to help out her students and would go out her way to see us succeed. As long as you attend class and read the textbook you should be fine!"
3629,1298609,5.0,2.0,"Go to class, pay attention in class, buy the textbook, and READ IT. Her tests come from both. She is one of the nicest professors I have had, and her class was so thought-provoking and helpful to my life outside of school."
3630,1298609,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Armstrongs lectures are amazing! Shes clearly very passionate about what she teaches and always makes material easy to understand. Textbook used every class, and she doesnt post PPTs online so either come to class or ask someone else for notes. Overall an amazing professor and a fair grader. Lets you makeup missed exams after taking finals"
3631,1298609,5.0,4.0,Professor Armstrong was one of the best professors I have had here! Her lectures are amazing and she is always willing to help. I 10/10 recommend.
3632,1298609,5.0,4.0,I loved Professor Armstrong! She gave the coolest lectures and made psychology interesting. She gave a lot of real world examples which really helped. We did not need the textbook as much as she said we did. Her tests were difficult but once you figured out how to study for them it wasn't too bad. She was very clear about deadlines and test dates.
3633,1298609,4.0,4.0,Dr. Armstrong is an overall good professor. She does not post slides so if you miss class you are a little out of luck. She will also mention things on her tests that are only from the textbook so you should definitely be reading it if you want to have a chance at doing well on the tests. Overall her classes are really interesting though.
3634,1298609,4.0,2.0,10% of your grade is doing random survey research things which is an easy 100 start plus a little bonus if you want. Another 25% is easy quiz type things you have the answers too if you take good notes. The rest is tests with one drop grade if you take the final. They're 50 questions and almost everything she mentions in lecture. Just go to class.
3635,1298609,5.0,3.0,"As a STEM major, I wasn't thrilled about taking psychology, but Prof Armstrong definitely made it worthwhile. Her lectures are easy to keep up with and are often entertaining due to her personality. Tests are straightforward and assignments are due at the end of the semester, but don't let them pile up! I highly, highly recommend prof Armstrong."
3636,1298609,5.0,3.0,Awesome! One of my favorite professors at MSU!
3637,1298609,5.0,3.0,"Probably my favorite professor at MSState. Dr. Armstrong is very passionate and obviously cares about what she lectures to her students. It is very easy to recall topics she lectures about, and she is great about getting the general message across. The tests and lectures are designed off of the textbook. Reading the textbook gives you an A, def."
3638,1298609,5.0,2.0,"Such a great professor! Seemed very approachable, and if you do what she tells you to do for studying you'll be just fine. You do actually have to read the book and be present at the lectures because the tests cover both, but if you pay attention in class and keep up with reading as you go you'll make the grade you want. Gives bonus/easy points."
3639,1298609,5.0,3.0,Reading from the textbook is required outside of class. She's very engaging during her lectures. Tests are easy as long as you read the book and listen in class.
3640,1298609,5.0,3.0,"I love this prof. She loves what she teaches, and is very understanding. If you have to take psy, for sure take her."
3641,1298609,4.0,4.0,"Rebecca does do some extra credit. She is very nice and is very knowledgeable about Psychology. You do have to put in the work but she makes the class as fun and as understandable as possible. I took this during covid so the class was not mandatory, but we were responsible for getting the notes that class period we missed."
3642,1298609,4.0,2.0,She is an amazing professor and very down to earth. She made public speaking easy. She was very personable and she is the reason i'm a better public speaker. Definitely take her if you have the chance.
3643,1298609,5.0,2.0,She is THE BEST lecturer that Mississippi State has to offer. The other professors should take her class just to learn how to teach.
3644,1298609,5.0,1.0,"She is a genuinely good person who loves what she teaches. She does not give her classes the feeling of being there just to do work, pass, and leave. She goes into details about the topics and is often times quite funny in her jokes. Very down to earth with a helpful attitude. Definitely one of the best college professors I've ever had."
3645,1298609,4.0,1.0,"You have to go to class and fill out a worksheet about the presentation/ lecture, but she goes over the answers before the end of class. No tests or quizzes. Overall very easy class."
3646,1298609,5.0,3.0,She is a great professor. She gives you a great note taking outlines and as long as you study the information or just listen in class you will pass. Also attendance isnt mandatory but it is very helpful and funny.
3647,1298609,5.0,2.0,General Psychology was my favorite class this semester and im glad i had Armstrong as a teacher. She breaks down the concepts with examples that will help you with test questions. The only grades in the class are the test and the final is optional so going to class and understanding key concepts in the book will result in an easy A.
3648,1298609,4.0,3.0,She is such a good teacher she makes sure to make all the topics relatable and easy to understand. If students have questions she will answer them right away and make sure the student understands before she moves on. You need the textbook because test questions can come from extra parts she didn't go over and vocabulary words. Overall a great class
3649,1298609,5.0,1.0,I loved this class. Professor Armstrong makes the class very entertaining and tells lots of funny stories. If you come to class and listen you will make a good grade on the test. I would highly recommend coming to every class and reading the book. She also gives extra credit if you participate in class. She is a wonderful teacher.
3650,1298609,5.0,2.0,"The best Psychology teacher. Lectures are very interesting. Take notes in class and pay attention, and you will do great on the test!"
3651,1298609,5.0,2.0,"Very interesting subject and she made it so. Textbook is used for lecture and is required. Only grades were tests but she curved all of them at least 2 points and gave out questions for the test in class. SI is also important, as test questions were given out there as well. Definitely a smart lady and a good teacher."
3652,1298609,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Armstrong is my favorite professor I have had on campus. She doesn't try to try you up in her tests, if it's on the test she either talked about it directly in class or it was a major point in the book. Also, if most of the class gets a question wrong on a test and she can see how it could be confusing she gives everyone the points."
3653,1298609,5.0,3.0,"She's very knowledgeable and eccentric, making her lectures especially informative and interesting. Her tests come mainly from lecture notes with details sprinkled in from the textbook; pay attention to details. I never studied super hard for her class and got an A with mediocre effort. I'd definitely recommend her."
3654,1298609,5.0,3.0,Armstrong was a wonderful teacher. She follows the book and shows the best way to take notes. 50 question tests with bonus questions. Show up to class because she doesn't always want everything in a chapter and she adds some stuff to the textbook information. No attendance grade.
3655,1298609,2.0,4.0,"Most exams cover more information out of the textbook instead of lecture. Does not provide slides, only material used is textbook."
3656,1298609,5.0,4.0,Very good professor. Would take again.
3657,1298609,2.0,3.0,"Overall, she wasn't a bad teacher. She is very OCD about the way you outline her lectures. Her tests are pretty difficult, but they get progressively easier by the final. I wouldn't take her again because overall she just annoyed me, but she's not a terrible professor if you have to take her. Also, attendance is not mandatory."
3658,1298609,2.0,4.0,It is a lot to taken in and she's very tedious about writing a outline for ALL her lectures. her class gets kind of annoying after a while because she has a lot of information she wants to cover in 50 mins. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone especially a 1st year student.
3659,1298609,4.0,4.0,"Nice woman who made class interesting and fun; however, the tests can be difficult especially if you don't take notes in class or read the book."
3660,1298609,5.0,3.0,My favorite professor at MSU. All of the lectures are very interesting and as long as you go to class you will know the information for the tests. I did have to read the textbook in addition to the lecture notes to do well on the tests. Material is not difficult to understand.
3661,1298609,3.0,4.0,She gives extra so definitely take advantage of that because the tests are really hard.  She says stuff in class that are not in the book so you should really go to class.  She gives you note outlines that help but you have to read cause she doesn't say everything that is in the book.  Overall she's good and an awesome person!
3662,1298609,4.0,3.0,"Very great teacher to have. She offers an opportunity to get 4 points added to your OVERALL grade so that was awesome. You are required by MSU to do PRP points, we had 8 but it ranges from 4 to 8 each semester. The final is optional."
3663,1298609,5.0,3.0,"I loved this class! Mrs. Armstrong is so passionate about the material, very open with students, and keeps class interesting. No homework, but I would definitely recommend keeping up with the textbook reading because that's what mostly on the test. Tests are fairly easy if you read, pay attention in class, and study a little. Definitely recommend!"
3664,1298609,4.0,4.0,I love this woman! You can tell she loves her job.
3665,1298609,5.0,2.0,She's very down to earth and easy going! Looks pretty good too!
3666,1298609,5.0,2.0,She's really good at explaining the material and makes the class very easy to understand.
3667,1298609,3.5,2.0,Mrs. Armstrong is a great teacher but if she falls behind in class she rushes through the rest of the material that is going to be on the test which makes it hard to take notes. You definitely need to read the textbook if you want a good grade on the test because the tests come straight from the book.
3668,1298609,2.5,4.0,I really did not like this class. She does not post notes. You learn only from reading and listening to her in class. You really have to read everything in the book to understand. The test are not easy.  I would not take this class again.
3669,1298609,4.5,1.0,I absolutely love Mrs. Armstrong. Her classes are enjoyable and she cover the material effectively. No homework and as long as you actually study the tests are easy.
3670,1298609,1.5,5.0,"Mrs. Armstrong definitely knows her material, but I would highly recommend to stay away from her class if you are a freshman. She teaches solely on a listening and note taking basis in a class of 300+ students and if you are not used to this method you will struggle in her class. I met with her regularly and still got a D. "
3671,1298609,2.0,5.0,Her class is hard and the test are difficult. 
3672,1298609,3.0,5.0,Her tests are extremely difficult because of the way she words her questions. She wastes a lot of time in class rambling. She has had to remove chapters from two of our 4 tests because she didnt cover the material. She only had 20 A's in a huge lecture class. I would not recommend her at all. 
3673,1298609,5.0,3.0,"She is a great teacher! She's very active in the school's extracurricular stuff and she is casually open with her students. Even if you don't like psychology, she will make the class interesting! Make sure you always do the book readings, tests incorporate that AND her lecture slides."
3674,1298609,5.0,1.0,She is really amazing! She keeps the class interesting and she is willing to make subjects clearer if need be. Her tests are very in depth so reading the book is highly recommended.
3675,1298609,5.0,2.0,She is the best teacher ever!! Extremely sweet and caring and really enthusiastic about the subject. Explains the material very well and on occasion acts out some concepts in class!!! I changed my major to Psychology after taking her class. I enjoyed every single day of the class and I wish she taught more classes. Definitely recommend her :)
3676,1298609,5.0,3.0,She is so outgoing and loves to teach! She is extremely helpful and willing to work with those who are willing to work hard.
3677,1298609,5.0,2.0,"I absolutely loved her class! She makes psychology interesting and easy to understand, and she is very helpful to any student with questions. Her tests are somewhat between easy and hard, you really have to pay attention in class. She doesn't test on facts usually, its more about understanding the concepts."
3678,1298609,4.5,3.0,Very enthusiastic about what she teaches. She is very smart and does a good job explaining things but she uses nothing from the notes on the test so going to class is basically pointless. Overall she is a good teacher and a very very nice lady
3679,1298609,3.0,3.0,"She rarely takes attendance on Fridays, and her finals are not mandatory, but the tests are completely out of the book. The lectures help almost 0 with the tests."
3680,1298609,5.0,1.0,Excellent teacher! Easy to understand and extremely enthusiastic about what she teaches.  The textbook is easy to read and  her lectures follow right along with it.  I definitely recommend her!!
3681,1298609,5.0,2.0,She is an amazing teacher who truly cares about her students and is always willing to help. She works incredibly hard to help her students succeed both in college and after graduation. I only wish that I was able to attend more of her classes. I definatly recommend her to anyone in Psychology for any class.
3682,1298609,5.0,2.0,"I wasn't at all enthused about taking intro to psychology, but had to because of my major. I absolutely loved this class and mrs Armstrong!  Tests come straight from the notes, notes come straight from the book. Bringing my book to class and hi lighting during lecture helped me a lot. I changed my major to psychology after taking this class."
3683,1298609,5.0,1.0,"SOOOOO AMAZING!!! Excellent teacher. She truly cares about her students and will help you no matter what it is. Tests are based on notes, so go to class!! You won't mind going though.. she is very animated and loves to tell stories! Favorite teacher at MSU."
3684,1298609,4.5,1.0,"Great teacher! Used great examples for everything which helped a lot! Recommends reading book a lot, but I did well with only referencing it. Very nice and helpful and definitely spiked my interest in psychology!"
3685,1298609,5.0,3.0,Great teacher! You will learn a lot from her.
3686,1298609,5.0,2.0,"Read the book, study your notes, pay attention and the tests will be easy for you. Interesting class"
3687,1298609,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic Teacher!!! She could get even the most bored students to love what she was teaching. She made me even consider changing my major to psychology for a while. She is clear and really good at explaining it, but at the same time you have to pay attention and take good notes or you'll have a problem in her tests. All in all a great teacher!"
3688,1298609,5.0,1.0,Great teacher!!!!!
3689,1298609,5.0,3.0,"nicest, most animated teacher I've had. very smart, very helpful."
3690,1298609,4.0,3.0,Great Teacher! Very interesting!
3691,1298609,3.5,3.0,The test can be really hard without studying well in advance
3692,1298609,5.0,1.0,"Attendance isn't mandatory, but going to class is the easiest way to pass the class. Buying the textbook isn't worth it if you go to class everyday. She told my class exactly what would be on the tests. Easy tests."
3693,1298609,5.0,4.0,"Wonderful teacher! If you don't understand something, just ask! Go to class because some of her notes aren't in textbook and you will understand the textbook more thoroughly with her explanations. Study a week ahead of test because tests cover a lot of notes!"
3694,1298609,4.0,2.0,"AWESOME, caring, fun, creative teacher! She definitely loves what she does. Test aren't THAT easy, but if you study, they arent hard! Take her!"
3695,1298609,4.5,3.0,"Great professor!  She's very animated and loves what she does.  I have learned a lot from this class thus far, and I really enjoy it!  I also love her grading system which is very fair."
3696,1298609,3.5,4.0,No Comments
3697,2142434,2.0,1.0,"For the most part, she's a really good teacher. But the tests are all open-ended to ""make sure you know the material instead of just memorizing it"". Her TA who's never in class grades the tests. And she screws you over on the final."
3698,2142434,4.0,1.0,She lets you miss classes that wont benefit you. she tells you exactly what's on exams. The tests aren't multiple choice so it isn't hard to pass. Its a nice environment and she encourages discussion. its a class none the less but it wont stress you out.
3699,2339052,5.0,1.0,Always there when you need him. He also streams on twitch for class days sometimes. Then there's the kahoots&#55358;&#56690;quality time. 10/10 would definitely go back and take again.
3700,2339052,4.0,3.0,"I loved this class and this professor. He was very funny and seemed to really care about the subject. The only issue I had was that in person class was canceled majority of the semester, but he would stream lectures on Twitch and answered the comments during the stream. He was very accessible as far as the streaming goes."
3701,2339052,5.0,1.0,"Professor Brandon is awesome!! Not only did I learn a ton in his class, but I had a good time doing it. He is very funny and makes the class super interesting. The quizzes and tests are not difficult."
3702,2339052,5.0,3.0,"Great professor Super fun guy, makes the course easy for you. Very helpful if you are struggling, he will help in whatever ways he can."
3703,2339052,5.0,2.0,"TAKE HIM! He makes the class interesting and overall is a great teacher. Loved this class and enjoyed taking it! Also no materials are required, so no money to spend on text books like most classes."
3704,2339052,5.0,3.0,"A very fun guy to have for a psychology lecture and makes it very interesting to learn about the topics at hand. Hes really chill and nice and is accessible outside of class. Tests arent too bad, mainly focusing on major points from lectures. Remember to get your 8 credits of PRP knocked out early in semester!"
3705,2339052,5.0,2.0,Russell is a great guy. He is very funny and wants to make the class enjoyable for everyone. There is a quiz/ free write posted online every week that do not take long at all and are very simple. He really cares about his students. Just tell him what's going on if you miss something and He is very understanding. Easy A.
3706,2339052,4.0,3.0,"Quiz due every week, attendance counts as part of your grade , the exams are every 5 weeks and are all written. One part is fill in the blank and then the second part is a couple of essays. To study for the exam you should do the end of chapter tests in the book , he gets questions from there and changes the names."
3707,2339052,4.0,2.0,Hilarious guy!! So easy to pay attention to. He gives free writes and quizzes every week that are easy grade boosters. He gives study guides before the tests and the final is optional and can replace your lowest test grade. Mandatory attendance
3708,2339052,5.0,2.0,"Professor Brandon is one of my favorite professors. Please take him if you can. Hell, wait for him. He's hilarious, and he explains concepts in ways that a college student will understand. He's very understanding about everything. All he asks is that you be respectful and pay attention. Exams are easy as long as you study the guides he provides."
3709,2339052,5.0,3.0,"Professor Brandon is the best PSY1013 professor possible. Lectures are engaging and he is hilarious, tests and quizzes are based off of powerpoint slides in class, and Kahoot Reviews give you extra credit on tests."
3710,2339052,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Brandon is hilarious and always makes the lectures interesting. He teaches efficiently, and I learned a lot from his lectures and class in general. He posts study guides for the test which basically mimic the test, but they are super long. One of my favorite professors  by far"
3711,2339052,5.0,2.0,"He's freaking amazing! His lectures are really engaging and informative, and he's hilarious! Everyone loves him, and we all learn a lot in his class. He makes everything very stress free, and the homework is not difficult. His study guides cover everything you'll need for the test, and he gives plenty of extra credit opportunities. 10/10 take again"
3712,2339052,5.0,2.0,"Brandon, by far, has been my favorite professor since coming to State. Every one of his lectures has never failed to engage me or make me laugh. Before each test we play Kahoot for bonus points. The freewrites are just 5 sentences or more and related to the chapter, and tests are JUST like the quizzes. He even gives freebie questions on it!"
3713,2339052,4.0,2.0,"Awesome, I loved his class last fall. He made everything entertaining and was an amazing teacher. I got to learn so much from him. I studied the study guides and made all As or high Bs on my tests. Highly recommend."
3714,2339052,5.0,3.0,"Professor Brandon makes his classes very interesting and engages with you. He will never let you get bored as he has quite the personality. Online freewrites/quizzes every week but they are easy to manage/complete. Tests are easy if you've studied a little bit. Overall, he is a great teacher."
3715,2339052,5.0,2.0,"Dude is hilarious and makes his lectures interesting. Plenty of easy short essays and quizzes to cushion your grade, and provides study guides that mimic the tests."
3716,2339052,5.0,2.0,This man is HILARIOUS. You will have an online quiz &amp; 2 freewrites per week due. 3 tests plus a final. The tests have study guides w/ the answers given. You can memorize the answers easily. He gives extra credit on review days before the exam. You get 3 free absences before you lose a point per day from participation. I changed my major Bc of him.
3717,2339052,5.0,2.0,"His class is quizzes, free writes, and the exams. The free writes are so easy. The quizzes come from the notes he gives in class. And the exam is questions off the quiz which he gives a study guide for. The questions are exactly the same too. He is really funny and knows what he is talking about. Attendance is mandatory."
3718,2339052,4.0,3.0,"Gives online quizzes due every Sunday, but they're not really hard. Most of the test builds upon what the quizzes cover. Reading is important to expand your understanding of specific terms. Good teacher."
3719,2552044,4.0,2.0,"He grades fairly, and I truly enjoyed this class. As long as you submit assignments on time you will have an easy ride."
3720,1187837,5.0,5.0,The class was extremely hard for a lower division class.  There was alot of reading and the exams were essay and short answer. You have to write good essays to pass the class.
3721,1187837,4.0,4.0,"Great lectures, difficult exams. I very much dislike assay style exams, but if you excel at them definitely take this instructor. He covers a lot of information, but delivers it well. He's like a living spark note (GOOD thing)."
3722,1187837,5.0,1.0,I learned so much in this class.Mr.Camper managed to take a class that covers 500 years and break it down in learnable parts.He is beyond fair letting you know when quizzes are being given and what to expect on the exams and give a review for the exam.He used powerpoint but you still have to take notes to succeed.The class is content driven heavy
3723,1187837,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Camper is a great teacher!He taught the course at a basic level. His quiz came from the book. Exams came from the lectures and were fill in the blank. He gave thorough reviews before each exam which was REALLY helpful. You do have to work to earn a decent grade, but he is such a wonderful guy and teacher that is will help you if you ask him."
3724,1187837,5.0,2.0,"One of the best teachers I have had, take him if you can."
3725,1187837,5.0,1.0,Very nice man.  Doesn't make you feel stupid in class and is encouraging. He presents a good balance of humor to keep you awake but is serious enough to let you know he expects quality work.  I really like him.  Just show up to discussion and make an effort to participate and you will do fine. He doesn't grade too hard and is easy to get along with
3726,1187837,5.0,1.0,wicked awesome!  he should be the lecturer instead of the professor we have.  I understand things alot beter when Professor Camper goes over the material.  He's not bad on the eyes and has a wonderful personality.  Take him if you can.
3727,1187837,5.0,2.0,"He is a very laid back teacher and is easy to understand. No homework, just read and discuss.I like him a lot and will be taking him again in the future. He is one of the few teachers I have encountered that actually likes teaching and being around students"
3728,1187837,4.5,5.0,"Professor Camper is a very nice, enthusiastic, and fun teacher and tries his best to liven up a very dull subject."
3729,1187837,5.0,3.0,Good Class.  Good Guy
3730,1187837,5.0,4.0,"I don't think words can describe how good Prof. Camper is. I didn't think I would like him, but he turned out to be one of my favorite teachers.  He is very demanding, but he is also very willing to help. Mr. C has the ability to explain history on a level that non-history majors can follow. He expects a thesis, supporting details and a conclusion"
3731,1187837,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Camper is wonderful and the nicest person I have ever met.I found it refreshing that if you asked him a question and if he didn't know the answe he would tell you &quot;I don't know.&quot; If you work hard, participate, ask questions, and go to him for help you will do fine.  He is the best professor I have had at MSU and really cares about his students."
3732,1187837,5.0,2.0,I highly enjoyed having him as my teacher. As long as you read and do the work you will breeze through the class and he likes the people who worked hard. he is easy to get along with and made class fun. make sure you read and know how to write thesis statements!
3733,1187837,5.0,4.0,Good class makes you work for your grade.
3734,1187837,5.0,4.0,"This guy is totally awesome!  I don't even like history and he made it enjoyable.  You have to read the textbook and reader for the quizzes. He is extremely helpful too.  Just to be around him he seems shy and lonely, but in the classroom this guy is funny. I love his discussion on WWI.  If you have the chance, take him you will learn alot."
3735,1187837,5.0,3.0,"This is the best proffesor that i've had at mississippi state. I would taked him for anything. His class isn't easy,  but you can easily make an a if you do the homework and pay attention in class. I'm usually a b or c student but I worked in this class and easily pulled out an A. Take the guy, he's funny too.e"
3736,1187837,5.0,5.0,"First off, the person who posted the &quot;sucks&quot; comment did not want to work. I want to mention that I only say he is hard because you MUST study. He will not hand out grades! If you earn an A that is what you get.  He is willing to help you if you ask. He really makes history come to life! He is the best professor of history I've ever had"
3737,1187837,1.0,5.0,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!  AVOID AT ALL COSTS
3738,1187837,4.5,5.0,Requires to much reading and grades really hard.  He seems like a nice guy.
3739,2207989,4.0,3.0,"Definitely not hard at all if you study and do your PRP points. She is very boring because she reads off the slides but a super sweet person and always willing to help if you ask or need to see her outside of class. She also gives lots of extra credit if you go to class, not hard at all. I loved her class."
3740,2207989,4.0,2.0,She is a nice teacher.  She has a monatone voice which makes the long lectures hard to pay attention. If you do not go to class you will not pass because she gives lots of extra credit for going to class study sessions.  If you pay attention and go to class you will get a good grade.
3741,2207989,3.0,3.0,"Pretty good professor, probably one of the most average teachers I've ever had. This class was literally just lecture notes, then you have to take more notes outside of class to be able to pass the tests and online quizzes. Don't worry about getting a bad grade, everything is scaled the same and you get extra credit for showing up."
3742,2167049,5.0,1.0,"Such an easy class. Great professor too. Can be boring. Grades pretty easy. Doesn't give clear criteria for writing papers, but I liked it that way bc it made the papers super chill. He wants you to pass. Sit at the front. Talk to him. He really is a cool guy. Usually got out of class early."
3743,2167049,5.0,2.0,Dr. Brandon is the best English professor you can get. I never submitted one paper or annotated bib through MindTap. He is just a laid back cool guy to talk to during discussion in class and loves to joke around. He knows college is stressful and tries not to make it even more stressful. By far the best professor you can get in the English Dept.!
3744,2167049,5.0,2.0,"One of the easiest professors in the English department! If you are lucky to get his class, just follow his instructions & you'll get an easy A!"
3745,2167049,5.0,1.0,"great teacher, funny guy, helps students a lot."
3746,1077520,4.0,2.0,"Mr. Walters does a good job introducing concepts, and his examples are a helpful starting point to practicing outside class, but he doesn't grade homework, which takes away any incentive to practice outside class. I had to take his class twice because I made this mistake. If you do the homework, you should be fine. Tests are similar enough."
3747,1077520,5.0,3.0,"Andy Walters is by far the best option you have for both statics and dynamics. Beware: he only has test grades. Those tests, though, are based off optional homework practice problems that will contain the same or very similar questions compared to the test. Do ALL the homework, pay attention in class, and you'll at least get a B. Easy grader!"
3748,1077520,5.0,3.0,"Walters was so great for statics. He gives great examples and is more than willing to answer questions. The only grades are the tests, but if you don't do the homework you'll bomb the tests. You have to have the book to do the homework too. Show up and pay attention and you'll be fine"
3749,1077520,4.0,3.0,Good professor. Sometimes concepts arent clear but reference the book and you will be fine.
3750,1077520,4.0,4.0,"Andy Walters is a great professor, but the class itself is pretty difficult. It really feels like he wants you to succeed. I was not great at any of the subject matter and managed to pass 3/4 of the tests. One thing: he works pretty easy problems in class and the test problems are harder/more complicated. I would definitely look over book examples."
3751,1077520,4.0,4.0,"Walters is a great professor, but the material in this course is difficult. If you do not attend this class, you will fail. My low grade shows that because I did not attend class as much as I should have, but my low grade does not reflect on Walters' performance. He is a great professor, but you will have to work for your grade in this course."
3752,1077520,4.0,4.0,"He words the content in a very clear and concise way. The honors Dynamics homework was mandatory and challenging, but it was directly related to the content from class. He told us exactly what problems to study and went over concepts multiple times for those who didn't get it the first time. Be sure to practice the concepts before the tests."
3753,1077520,4.0,3.0,"He teaches in a way that is very easy to understand. He is very straightforward with lectures and works through plenty of example problems with basically every scenario imaginable. The final grade is solely based on tests, so do what you can to study. Overall, he is an amazing professor, and I will be recommending him to everyone who asks."
3754,1077520,5.0,3.0,Great option for Materials. Recommend him for all the Engineering Mechanic classes.
3755,1077520,5.0,3.0,"Best Professor I have ever taken. He is very fair with partial credit on tests. The entire grade is based on tests and the final, unless you take him for Honors, where there are writing assignment. As long as you go to class and do some of the optional homework, you will pass. I am taking him again for two classes next semester"
3756,1077520,5.0,2.0,"Walters does a fantastic job at explaining the material of his course, even when it is complicated. His tests are very fair, and if you know the material you should have no issue doing well in his class. This is important because tests comprise the entirety of the final grade. I am taking him again next semester for another class."
3757,1077520,5.0,3.0,"Very good teacher who relays complicated material in a simple, easier manner"
3758,1077520,5.0,3.0,"Very kind and a Generous Grader. If you study for the test, you will pass. Only thing ,at least for statics, your grade comes straight from 4 tests and a exam. Homework is not used in grade."
3759,1077520,5.0,4.0,"I will take Walters for literally any class possible. He does not assign any homework, but he does give you access to many, many optional practice problems that you HAVE to do in order to be successful on the tests. The tests are normally 4 questions but he is very generous with partial credit and the the tests are very fair. Take him!!"
3760,1077520,5.0,3.0,Mr. Walters is a great professor for Mechanics of Materials. He did a good job of explaining the material and breaking down problems to make them easier. Tests were similar to class and homework problems. A very generous grader that does not count off a lot for simple mistakes. Would definitely recommend him over other professors for EM3213
3761,1077520,5.0,3.0,"Generous grader, will take off few points for wrong number/unit. Suggests problems from book to study for tests. Explains how to solve problems clearly and makes it seem easy, therefore boosting the students' confidence in solving problems. Open to emails and office hours. Tone of voice may seem negative at times but just want the best for students"
3762,1077520,4.0,3.0,"He is the single best test grader I've had. If you make an error with a number but get the process right, he'll dock 1-2 points (the problem is worth 20-30 points) for the number and still give you the credit for the process. Homework is optional, but is absolutely necessary to do well on tests. The hardest test is the final, so know your stuff"
3763,1077520,4.0,4.0,"Walters is definitely the best statics professor at MSU in my opinion. He really knows what he is talking about; he gives a lot of examples in class that are useful. Homework isn't graded, but it comes in handy studying for tests. He gives plenty of partial credit. Tip: on tests, if you mess up, leave him a note; he will count off less for it."
3764,1077520,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Walters knows what he is talking about and can teach the material in an effective manner. The homework is not graded, but it is basically a study guide for the test. The only problem is the stuff taught in class is not exactly the same on the homework... DO THE HOMEWORK"
3765,1077520,4.0,3.0,Dr. Walters is a great choice for Statics. His teaching is easy to understand and he takes his time through difficult material. He is also very helpful if you ask him questions. He gives tons of partial credit on tests too.
3766,1077520,4.0,3.0,"Prof Walters is an amazing professor for Statics. His lectures are always extremely specific, and the examples he does are straight from the textbook. The tests are 4-5 questions made up of examples he assigns for homework. 10/10 would take him again"
3767,1077520,5.0,3.0,"Walters gave extremely prepared lectures that helped learning along with very fair tests. All four tests were basic difficulty questions, but the final was slightly harder. Overall, a very fair test grader. He gives tons of partial credit even if worked entirely wrong. Accessible outside of class. No extra credit however. Good teacher."
3768,1077520,5.0,4.0,"I had Professor Walters for both Dynamics and Mechanics of Materials. He gave great detailed lectures, and he was always willing to help when asked. The best test grader I've had yet because of the partial credit he gives. All points taken off my tests were very fair. Fair tests and an average difficulty final exam."
3769,1077520,5.0,3.0,"Andy is one of the best instructors I've had, his lectures are clear and concise as long as you show up and pay attention. He will answer any question you have if he can. His tests can be challenging but they are similar to problems done in class or homework. He makes you work for your grade, but if you study and do your homework you will do fine. "
3770,1077520,4.5,4.0,"Mr. Walters is a good teacher.  His tests are REALLY hard, but if you do all of the optional homework to prepare, you'll do fine.  There little required homework but you will have to do the optional if you want to stand a chance in his Engineering Mechanics II: Dynamics class.  He is clear, works many examples.  He is a little bland but not bad."
3771,1077520,5.0,2.0,"He is a great teacher and is more than willing to help a student out if you are trying. However, don't expect to do well if you don't pay attention or ask questions. His door is always open, and he is always willing to show you how to work out the problems. I had him for statics, dynamics and Mechanics of Materials. Highly recommend"
3772,1077520,4.5,4.0,"He is very clear and concise. He usually tries to help you out if you need that one extra point. His homework is pretty hard, but you can ask him questions and he always gives great explanations."
3773,1077520,3.0,4.0,"I had him for Engineering Mechanics: Statics. Not a bad teacher, but I found it hard to pay attention in his class. Do your homework and STUDY."
3774,4368,5.0,1.0,show. up and pass
3775,4368,4.5,4.0,He is the best teacher in the College of Business at State. He will definitely push you and make you work for your grade but you will learn a lot and actually get something out of the class. 
3776,4368,3.5,5.0,His class was extremely challenging. He definitely knows what he is talking about however. I do feel that his exams aren't fair especially the final. The final was AJAX which was only covered once in class which killed a lot of peoples grade in the class.
3777,4368,2.0,4.0,I took him for advanced languages 1 and its a challenge. He is very knowledgeable of the material and you need to come to class. He wants us to the class message board. The homework was decent but the exams were difficult. You must pay attention towhat  he says cause he make a question on the writing part of the exam.
3778,4368,4.5,3.0,Great Teacher
3779,4368,2.5,5.0,"He has more reviews than any professor at MSU for a reason, he is very polarizing. Which will surprise you because when you first meet him he seems like the nicest professor ever. It kinda seems He he has favorites? (Why) and one time literally ignored me when I said ""Hey"" to him in McCool. (He was on a crutch for his leg at the time so maybe that?"
3780,4368,4.0,5.0,"Rodney Pearson is a very intellectual type. I took his class in Visual Basic programming and had little interest in it beyond being a prerequisite for my degree. I had difficulty at first but eventually applied myself, this class 'instantiated' my love for computer programming and I owe this man a lot. Thanks, and keep kicking ass!"
3781,4368,2.0,4.0,"Extremely smart, but difficult to understand if you're new to the subject.  He has &quot;pets&quot; in class that can do no wrong, and others that he seems to ignore.  When asking for help outside of class, he makes you feel as though you're stupid and wasting his time.  I think he's extremely smart, but has difficulty relating to students."
3782,4368,4.5,4.0,You will understand JavaScript and be able to make fun little applications by the time you finish this class.
3783,4368,5.0,5.0,"Some people must confuse ego with accomplishments. Should he apologize that he graduated from Harvard&#63; Should he apologize that he is intelligent&#63; In my experience, he obviously cares about students -- a lot. He is always prepared, and he goes WAY beyond the call of duty in helping everyone 24/7. Great teacher who prepares us for careers in MIS."
3784,4368,3.0,4.0,"I've been in college 3 years, and never have I met a professor as misleading. He seems so nice and upbeat during class, but when you meet him, he is an arrogant jerk. Reading all the reviews below, it seems like im not the only one. I see the word ego written alot, and I think that really nails it on the head. my advice- Drop his class!!!"
3785,4368,2.0,4.0,"Knowledgable, organized, and competent in his field, but extremely arrogant and unhelpful, which outweighs all the positives and makes his classes a drag. Do not be fooled my his friendly demeanor in class. In actuality, Pearson is as nerdy and introverted as it gets, which many students find out by the time it's too late to drop."
3786,4368,4.5,2.0,"One of the best teachers I've had yet. He makes class fun, tells jokes, but doesn't let it interfere with your learning. Tests a challenge but are very do-able. Goes over everything pretty much step by step. Very smart. If your a beginning programmer I highly recommend him. You get 3 points added to your grade if you don't miss class. I made a &quot;B&quot;"
3787,4368,3.5,4.0,He really has one of the biggest Ego's i've ever seen from a professor. He has a very &quot;ole miss&quot; like persona about him. avoid if possible.
3788,4368,2.5,4.0,"It was difficult to get around his HUGE ego. I was also not happy to be forced to take a COBOL class that is so outdated that it will not benefit me in any future endevour. You will learn something, but it will most likely involve how many miles he runs a day or his past educational experiences. Avoid him if possible."

3795,2838802,5.0,3.0,Amy was an excellent professor and passionate about her students. One time a student began choking on some food while in class and Amy took a ballpoint pen and performed an emergency tracheostomy. Another time my car broke down and Amy rebuilt the transmission on the side of the road with just a screwdriver and some duct tape. Best teacher at MSU
3796,1421619,1.0,5.0,Dr. Gordans test are the most difficult tests i've ever taken. There is so much material covered in class and she wont tell you what to study or about anything on the exam. I counted 184 slides of notes for a 48 question test. DO NOT TAKE HER COURSE
3797,1421619,5.0,5.0,"There are a lot of bad reviews of Dr. Gordon, and people purposefully wait until the Spring to take Dr. Kaplan to get around Dr. Gordon, but honestly, if you're going on to prof. school, take Dr. Gordon. Her Cell Bio gives you more than enough info for the MCAT, and she'll expect just as much from you as your prof. school instructors will. 10/10"
3798,1421619,1.0,5.0,Do not take her for this course! I literally read the entire textbook and still failed her tests!
3799,1421619,1.0,5.0,Donna Gordon was the absolute worst professor I have ever encountered. Does not respond to e-mails. Unavailable outside of class. Takes an easy subject like Cell Biology and purposefully over complicates the material. Her poorly worded tests are too long to finish. You can't hear her during lecture and only addresses one side of the classroom. BAD!
3800,1421619,2.5,5.0,She writes her exams at a graduate level. DON'T TAKE HER
3801,1421619,3.0,5.0,Donna Gordon is the hardest professor I've ever taken.  The material is a lot to remember and she expects you to know every detail. 
3802,1421619,5.0,4.0,Great teacher. 
3803,1421619,3.5,3.0,"Gordon is an OK teacher, but the material is pretty hard so extra reading after class definitely helps. The tests are tricky sometimes because of the wording. Read the questions thoroughly! If she does help sessions after class, go because sometimes other people think of questions that you didn't think of that help you understand the material."
3804,1421619,5.0,5.0,She is such a nice teacher so helpful and funny. BUT this class is really really hard. lots of material and you actually have to understand processes not just memorize things
3805,1421619,4.5,4.0,"If you are struggling, meet with her during office hours.  She is extremely helpful one-on-one.  Her class is going through powerpoints and tests aren't bad at all if you just study."
3806,1421619,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Gordon is hard.  You really need to go to class and pay attention.  Her tests are extremely straight forward and actually easy, if you actually studied (not just look at your notes).  She was completely fair and did everything to help.  I recommend her."
3807,1421619,2.0,5.0,advanced cell biology
3808,1487162,3.0,4.0,"Lecture heavy, but easy to communicate and make appointments with if you don't understand. Tests are in essay form but even if you miss class, reading the book has the same information. I honestly liked his class, I love essay form tests. However, attendance is mandatory and he never cancels class."
3809,1487162,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I have ever had.  You must read 5 entire books in a semester.  He grades subjectively so there is no way to gauge how to accurately answer discussion questions.  You will never earn an A in his class because there is no definitive answer to any questions. He will blame all technical issues on your browser and Blackboard.  Horrible!
3810,1487162,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! It is very hard to receive a good grade in his class. His exams consist of discussion and multiple choice questions. He will NOT award full credit for discussion questions even if you cover everything he asks for. The quizzes come from the test banks and will often count you wrong even if you have the correct.
3811,1487162,1.0,1.0,"The worst professor I have ever had. Completely unresponsive to emails, refuses to correct quizzes when they are wrong, and is all around an unpleasant person. I am a history major and have all A's in my other major courses, but got a B in this intro level course due to the professor. He is in the wrong profession."
3812,1020218,5.0,4.0,"He is pretty hard, you need to be very sincere in class and really have to know the subject very well to get an A. He is an amazing professor, I have ever had in my life. His class is full of energy and many seniors have got jobs due to his class. Very interesting class and topics are related to present day. I very much recommend taking his class."
3813,1020218,5.0,3.0,Will recommend to any students! He really takes interest to make you learn.
3814,1020218,5.0,3.0,"He is a very nice professor and helps students very much. prepares well before the class and if you study well, u will get an A for sure."
3815,2781510,1.0,5.0,"While some complaints of difficulty of coding problems from others in the class seem a little much, he doesn't teach the material the best and expects much more from students on the homework than what he's even taught. His dismissive and belittling attitude has been a bigger problem. I don't foresee a high class avg even with the high drop rate."
3816,2781510,1.0,5.0,"The class was EM4143 not ASE3823 but the complaints I've seen are the same ones my class has. Lectures are totally unhelpful and assignments are far beyond anything covered in class. He has a callous, dismissive attitude to student concerns and refuses even the slightest extensions no matter how much we complain. He is genuinely a terrible teacher."
3817,2781510,1.0,5.0,Spent heavy amount of hours self teaching ourselves because lectures and notes helped none. This is most certainly the worse professor. Grading has been horrendous with class averages being border line failing for every assignment. 10/10 do not recommend 
3818,2781510,1.0,5.0,Its clear that Dr Sun does not have experience teaching through both the way he approaches the structure of the class and how he delivers the material. This is a challenging course and his delivery doesnt aid in grasping content. He also is not empathetic to the class as he makes remarks saying things are easy and doesnt care about our grades.
3819,463176,1.0,5.0,Had him my sophomore year. One of the worst teachers at Mississippi State. Do not take this man as your teacher. 
3820,463176,2.0,4.0,"Honestly just stood there or paced back and forth and talked for an hour without stopping. Hard to keep up. The bulk of my grade was three exams which included a five-paragraph (minimum) essay and four short-ish answer ""ID"" questions. Tough professor, but he rounded my final grade up like three points to an A when I should have ended with a B."
3821,463176,2.0,4.0,"He is rather rude when it comes to participation and grading. He expects too much (multiple homework assignments, readings, and discussions) throughout the week for students that take this an a mandatory elective. Extremely harsh grader and the test is only an essay/term definitions. He does offer 4 dropped grades at the end of the semester."
3822,463176,2.0,5.0,"He uses PowerPoint in class and is good at describing PowerPoint, but he talks fast. He does not put the power points online. Tests are not super hard, but they are not easy. Things are graded difficult, and you have to put things word for word for tests and homework. "
3823,463176,1.0,5.0,"This class was the most difficult class that I have ever taken at Mississippi State. I would not recommend this class unless it pertains to your major, and you are required to take it. The class is very lecture heavy, requires a ton of reading, an extremely hard grader, unclear directions, and does not give any time for the weekly homework."
3824,463176,1.0,5.0,"By far worst professor Ive had at MSU in 3 years. His lectures are based around opinion, and if you speak up to answer a question and answer wrong he makes you feel like an idiot. Grades incredibly tough unless youve taken him before and he likes you. Does not care about his students, worst professor i have ever had."
3825,463176,4.0,4.0,"sure the class is hard but if you do your homework and take notes (of what he is saying, not what's on the slides), you can make an A"
3826,463176,1.0,4.0,Heavy course load. It is hard to follow his lecture because he makes few points and talks extremely fast.
3827,463176,2.0,4.0,"I do not recommend anyone take Dr. Messer for Early U.S. History. There is a lot of reading involved (3 to 4 documents a week) as well as homework. It just takes a lot of time and effort that you could be putting into a class more important. Although, he was helpful outside of class so he's not a bad guy. It is possible to receive an A if you work."
3828,463176,1.0,5.0,Terrible professor. Teaches his class like we are all about to get a doctorate in history. Exams are impossible to get a good grade on. Haven't met anyone in my class that has above a C. Do yourself a favor and don't even think about putting yourself in his class.
3829,463176,1.0,4.0,"VERY HARD class! He is super boring in class, which makes it very hard to pay attention. Reading is a must. Homework is not always easy, depending on the TA. Very strict about cell phones."
3830,463176,3.0,4.0,Not that bad if you pay attention
3831,463176,1.0,5.0,Please do not torture yourself.
3832,463176,1.5,5.0,"This is definitely one of the hardest classes i have taken at State. Messer is very scattered and does not stick with one topic or time period throughout a lecture. Last semester I received an A in Modern U.S. History, so I was expecting the same in this class. No matter how much I studied, I could not seem to succeed. 10/10 would NOT take again."
3833,463176,1.0,4.0,"Messer is probably the worse professor I've had at State.  He seems to know what he's talking about, but the lectures will not help you on the test at all.  The discussion class is helpful, but his lectures are unorganized and the multiple choice part of the exam is ridiculous and I don't know anyone that has passed it no matter how much you study"
3834,463176,1.0,5.0,"Avoid this professor at all costs. He is very intelligent but cannot teach at all. The documents you have to read don't make sense, the homework is stupid, and the tests are two essays with unclear prompts in 45 minutes. Don't take Early US with him. Just don't."
3835,463176,1.0,5.0,He is just to full of himself. Gets old listening to his asinine rants.

3839,1478996,2.0,4.0,"She doesn't teach. You read the book. If she does hold a class, extremely rare, she uses slides that come with the book. You basically are paying tuition for a book recommendation."
3840,2625884,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Bahler is a great professor who is very knowledgeable in French. I have a significant background in French and noticed that she had a very immersive learning style and taught the class mainly in French which is more suited for II/III, if you have no background in French you will struggle since immersive learning isn't beneficial if you're 18+."
3841,2625884,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bahler is a very easy professor as long as you take pride in what you're learning. She is very energetic and is genuinely interested in helping her students. However, participation is crucial and partner work is prominent, but the class is overall really fun and easy. Homework every night too, but again, really easy."
3842,2625884,5.0,2.0,Dr. Bahler made me love French! She taught really well and made me excited to go to class everyday.
3843,2625884,5.0,3.0,"I took her for French 1, and I'm so glad I had her again for French 4. Super straightforward, helpful, and always finding ways to make a difficult language make sense for English speakers. She does speak fluent French most of the class, but this helped me understand the language better overall. Solid 10/10!"
3844,2625884,3.0,2.0,"French I is a relatively easy class and a good introduction to the language. Dr. Bahler really knows the language, but she mostly talks in fluent french which makes it really hard to learn sometimes and pick up what she is talking about. Be prepared to do a lot of translating online and to sort of teach yourself. Attendance is mandatory."
3845,2625884,5.0,3.0,"This was my second time taking French and Dr. Bahler is the only reason I understood it this time. She explains everything clearly and takes it slow with new concepts and vocabulary. She is also very understanding. If you have a problem or need help, just go explain the situation to her and she will work with you. I wish she was teaching French 2!"
3846,2625884,5.0,2.0,"Loved taking French I with Dr. Bahler, and I hate that she won't be teaching French II next semester, as she's the only FL prof. I ever want to have. Great, entertaining lectures, and, despite having way too many absences this semester, was willing to help bring my grade up a bit because of my participation in class. Take her and you wont regret it"
3847,2625884,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors so far! Her class was very enjoyable and she made it easy to learn the language. Classes and attendance are very important, so make sure you try to make it to each lecture."
3848,2625884,5.0,4.0,Very caring and you learn a lot in the lectures
3849,2625884,2.0,4.0,"french I felt like french II or III. I was lucky enough to have high school french under my belt, but even with that, it's a very hard class. She teaches as if we already know french, and I'm leaving the class fluent in numbers and literally nothing else. shes nice but beware: you will NOT leave this class being able to write/speak much of anything"
3850,2625884,5.0,4.0,love her! she helps u with what u need and is very understanding! also the class is very interesting g and easy to listen too
3851,2625884,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bahler is so sweet! Her class is fun and relatively easy to understand. She's encouraging, wants her students to succeed, and very patient. French isn't easy, but she makes the class interesting and helpful! Given the COVID-19 situation, she made the best of our Zoom meetings, keeping them interactive. Love her class and would take her again!"
3852,2789729,5.0,3.0,"the coolest, most down to earth, hilarious teacher any1 could have. is always herself & not afraid to laugh at herself when she makes mistakes. responds to emails quickly & grades assignments in a timely manner. I took her for intro to African American literature & the class was fun & easy. Be sure to read the assigned readings & you will do well!"
3853,2412912,5.0,2.0,"He keeps class interesting but goes through notes quickly. If you show up to class and look over notes before a test, you'll probably get an A. He is kind, understanding, and funny. He helped me decide what I want to do after I graduate."
3854,2437489,1.0,5.0,The most boring teacher and reads directly from the slides. Does not answer emails. Gives practice problems for tests and quizzes but none of it is anything like the actual quiz or tests. Gives less time to take the quizzes compared to other classes. Basically have to teach yourself and go to other teachers SI sessions to actually learn something.
3855,2437489,3.0,4.0,"He's pretty mediocre. He reads directly from the slides and doesn't really try to make class interesting. He is always willing to help students, but sometimes struggles at explaining material effectively. This is also his first year teaching, so he doesn't have much experience and is still probably trying to get used to it. Class is hard, so study."
3856,2437489,2.0,4.0,"Professor Dowell is VERY boring, monotone, and hard to listen to. He does offer a lot of practice problems but they are nothing like the problems on the test which is much harder. GO TO CLASS. He adds fifty points to the mini exam if you don't miss class which helps a lot. I never even looked at the book. This class requires a lot of studying."
3857,2437489,3.0,4.0,"I thought he was a pretty average teacher, nothing special. He would help you if you went after class or to office hours, but other than that in lectures I learned almost nothing. I had to rely on myself reading the book and powerpoints to learn the material. The in class quizzes sucked and I did bad on most, but aced all the big tests."
3858,2437489,2.0,3.0,"Professor Dowell is just okay. Chem I and II are standardized across the university, so it doesn't really matter who you take. That being said, Dowell would not be my first choice. His lectures are a drag and the way he explains things and answers questions is not always the most helpful. Okay teacher for a course a lot of people struggle with."
3859,2437489,2.0,3.0,"Mr. Dowell is a grad student. First time teaching chemistry II, which obviously affects things. Quizzes come from the textbook, so read and work the problems out. He is so nice, but going to help sessions and other teachers' office hours saved my grade. Do not rely on Mr. Dowell's help for an A. You will have to work for it."
3860,2437489,1.0,4.0,"Chem 2 is hard how it is but taking dowell is asking to not learn and lower your gpa. I went to an SI where the student told us a problem on the quiz dowell never taught and is extremely difficult. he give no extra credit, doesnt answer emails, reads directly from the slides, and doesnt have the same expectations other the other chem 2 teachers"
3861,2437489,3.0,3.0,"Dowell is up and down in terms of lecturing. Some days he makes sense, others he doesn't. Would avoid if possible, but not the end of the world if you get him."
3862,2437489,1.0,5.0,"Wish I got payed that much to read slides as fast as I can. It wouldnt be a problem if he didnt skip over all of the practice problems. Also for someone who doesnt do much teaching, he is the slowest grader in the department."
3863,2437489,3.0,3.0,"Dowell's a good professor teaching a bad course. The way the material is presented in CH1213 makes it unnecessarily difficult. That being said, Dowell tries his best to make the class as painless as possible. He sometimes glosses over important topics, or takes too long on easier topics, but overall he does a good job with the materials he is given"
3864,2437489,3.0,4.0,"his lectures aren't that great tbh but it's because the chem department makes them teach so much material. 1 on 1 he is great at explaining material and he does care about his students. the chem department is pretty bad no matter who you take, but Mr. Dowell is at least aware that everyone hates it and how bad it is lol so he's not as uppity"
3865,2437489,3.0,3.0,"Chemistry is one of the hardest freshman classes. I think Dowell did a great job teaching this year, however the material is NOT EASY! There were many review sessions, however there was no SI. He reads directly off the slides the majority of the time and provides tons of practice problems. He is very nice and if you go to office hours, he will help"
3866,1626488,5.0,2.0,"Clear expectations and helpful if you have any questions. She may not use Canvas a lot, but she's willing to help you know your grades and get to where you need to be. She gives plenty of review for tests and quizzes and lets you know exactly what you need to know for all assignments and tests. Definitely would take again!"
3867,1626488,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Nigro is a great professor! She cares about her students and does everything she can to make sure you understand the material. While it is true that she doesn't use Canvas a lot, she is willing to help you in any way possible to understand the material, and she's hilarious and super reasonable. An amazing foreign language professor!"
3868,1626488,1.0,4.0,"I would never recommend her to anyone. Her lack of communication and rudeness is just astonishing. She refuses to really use canvas. We have no idea what our grades are. She does not provide any feedback on our homework, so we have no idea if we are actually correct or incorrect following her vague video lessons."
3869,1626488,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Nigro is very sweet and caring. She is patient and understands that you are learning a language for the first time. Assigns homework often, but it is short and easy. She doesn't post notes online so you must come to class and take notes to have reference material. Will call you out to answer homework questions, and despises phones out in class."
3870,1626488,5.0,3.0,Really enjoyed this class. My conversation isn't where I wanted it to be but I was able to pick up reading and writing quickly!
3871,1626488,3.5,3.0,"Mrs. Nigro is very funny, and she is a really great teacher. I highly recommend her if you want to learn Italian."
3872,1290617,2.5,3.0,He does not explain problems very well.  My dad helped me solve a problem over the phone better than Joe Jordan did in person.
3873,2494843,1.0,4.0,Worst teacher I have had in college. She does not provide adequate directions for assignments and then heavily penalizes you for not doing the assignment exactly how she wants. Also gives little to no feedback on drafts. The semester is spent writing a bunch of pointless papers on one topic just to write a final paper at the end of the semester 
3874,2494843,1.0,4.0,"Horrible will frustrate you, lose your papers, and not grade accurately."
3875,1077637,2.5,3.0,"Thought the class was fairly unorganized, difficult to follow and entirely too time consuming.  I absolutely spent more time on this class than I had EVER spent on another course, graduate level or undergrad.  A requirement to graduate but not particularly enjoyable, the grading was tough but reasonable."
3876,1077637,1.5,4.0,She is awful.  The content of the class is really easy but she is so unorginized.  Some times you dont even know something is due until the day of.  If you have a choice choose someone else.  I would never take her for anything.
3877,586132,1.0,5.0,"Professor Arnoldus teaches a very volatile and difficult subject in Physics. The way grades are calculated, you are set up for failure as it is up to random chance on homework and EXTREMELY picky partial credit on exams. He is sarcastic, condescending and unapproachable. I went to office hours and got belittled for lack of understanding. Please no."
3878,586132,1.0,4.0,"Truly the worst I've ever had. There were 15 assignments total, 12 HW, 3 tests, 1 Final. Homework is graded incredibly fast, but thats beyond made up for in fairness and useless feedback (none). He will select a single problem for you HW, grade it out of 10, that's it. Half my assignments he chose the ONE I missed and I got a 0. Avoid at all costs."
3879,586132,1.0,3.0,Overall a pretty bad professor. His grading is questionable. You can write out the correct work but still get points taken off because it was not worked out the way he liked. Tests are somewhat similar to homework. If I hadn't learned physics so well in high school my grade most likely would be much lower. 
3880,586132,1.0,5.0,"This has to be the worst experience I have had with a professor to date. Many of his lectures are started nearly five minutes late and end on average 15-20 minutes early. Exam questions are taken directly from his homework and lectures, but even then, they are often changed enough that if you use his method, you will only receive partial credit."
3881,586132,1.0,5.0,"Just terrible.  On more than one occasion a homework problem would be a question we worked in class, so I would simply submit what he wrote down, and still gets points taken off.  Tests do not relate to what is done in class/homework."
3882,586132,1.0,4.0,"Counts off a lot of points if you don't work problems his way, gives you a failing test grade even if answers are right. You can not hear him talk except through the microphone even though the classroom is the size of a high school room. He is from the netherlands so his vocabulary is very strange and does not make understanding him easy. DONT TAKE"
3883,586132,1.0,5.0,"he's so bad, I want to give him a zero. but that's not possible, so I give him a one."
3884,586132,1.0,4.0,Henk is simply not built to be a professor. His interactions w/ students are often rude &amp; sarcastic. The lectures are well-designed but poorly presented. Answering in class incorrectly makes Henk believe he can embarrass you in front of the class. His grading style is horrible: Correct answers on the homework only receive credit if worked HIS way.
3885,586132,2.0,4.0,"Not very good in helping understand harder material if you are struggling with it. Homework is a large portion of final grade, but not clear on how it is graded."
3886,586132,1.0,4.0,"Does not help you at all. He is rude and doesnt grade on a curve. If you have him, be ready to teach yourself. He is a sorry excuse for a professor. Going to office hours? He tells you to get out. Asking for help after class? Study more. If you can avoid him do so."
3887,586132,1.0,4.0,He is not friendly at all. He grades very tough in the test and wants everything done his specific way. He only grades one of the 10 problems on the homework . So hope you get that one problem correct.
3888,586132,1.0,5.0,"if it was stormy on the days of class, I wouldn't bring an umbrella because I'd rather be struck by lightning than go to this man's class."
3889,586132,4.0,4.0,"Henk is a strict grader but he is the best option for this class! Has good physics knowledge. He explains his content well and tests reflect exactly what you get on homework and suggested problems. Also, if you get stuck on a question, just let him know after class, and he will WALK you through it all. Expect an easy A once you have done all that!"
3890,586132,1.0,5.0,"He doesnt teach very well, doesnt answer questions efficiently and all around doesnt seem to care about your success. Very very hard grader. If you mess up a number, expect to automatically lose half"
3891,586132,1.0,5.0,I can't stress enough how terrible this guy is. He doesn't care about your success in his class all he cares about is giving you bad grades. His tests are almost impossible to do well on because he doesn't know what he's looking for when grading. If you ask for help you won't get it. I took him online and had to teach myself everything and got an f
3892,586132,1.0,5.0,Do yourself a favor and DO NOT take physics with Henk. Very hard to pass and he is very strict on grading. His slideshows and lectures are hard to follow and you can't pass the exams unless you study the textbook front to back.
3893,586132,1.0,5.0,He doesn't do any examples for you he only throws a pdf on screen and talks over it. On top of that he wants it done a specific way which he of course doesn't explain. A sad excuse for a professor STAY FAR FAR AWAY. Also really creepy and hard to understand.
3894,586132,1.0,5.0,He didnt care whatsoever about his students and we basically had to teach ourselves on a Calculus based Physics class so you can imagine how that went
3895,586132,1.0,3.0,Thinks that powerpoints are substitute for actual teaching. When you ask him for more he will tell you to stop whining.
3896,586132,3.0,5.0,"Tests are best 4/5 and come straight from class notes/homework, and he gives partial credit, but can be kinda strict about it. He only grades one of the homework problems, so if that's the one question you got wrong, then you failed the entire assignment. Tests aren't terribly hard if you understand the concept, and you're allowed a formula card."
3897,586132,3.0,5.0,Now I see why everyone warns against taking physics at State. Arnoldus is a pretty funny guy and he genuinely wants you to do well but... the class is stressful and it's a lot of material. His test are straight homework problems but if you don't understand the material you're doomed. It's very fast paced and he does nothing to ease the difficulty.
3898,586132,4.0,4.0,"Henk is by far the best physics prof Ive ever had. He gives lots of examples and has an awesome sense of humor. His tests are best 4/5 so if you dont know how to work a question, you can still do good. He give hw from the book and he only grades 1 random question from it though. He is ALWAYS in his office outside of class."
3899,586132,1.0,4.0,"Just dont even go there. The hardest I have worked in my entire college career has been for this class, and I still have to retake it. He doesnt care whether you have worked hard for your grade, hes not going to help you out."
3900,586132,4.0,4.0,"I liked Prof Arnoldus! He definitely makes you work for your grade, but it's because he wants you to understand the material. He made us put our phones in a basket, but I took him in the summer so maybe thats not always. He explains slowly and makes sure everyone understands. He's a goofy guy and I'm glad I took him for physics I."
3901,586132,4.0,2.0,"Before I took his class I was worried because of all the bad reviews, but he's really not that bad. He is a strict grader but it's mostly notation he's picky about, and he makes his expectations on that very clear. Just do the test problems exactly the way he shows you. Tests are not hard at all except for maybe one tricky question on each."
3902,586132,3.0,4.0,Dr. Arnoldus is not a terrible professor. He understands physics really well but I would recommend having a basic understanding of physics before taking this class. He is a tough grader and the criteria is not clearly stated but gives extra credit if you do all of the homework. I would probably take this class at a junior college.
3903,586132,1.0,5.0,"Rude and arrogant. He is not willing to put in any extra help to help you understand the material. He has very strict, non consistent grading criteria that you cant prepare for because he doesnt even know what he is looking for. Overall he should not be a professor cause he doesnt care about students or how well they learn the information."
3904,586132,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Arnoldus does not care about you or your GPA. While I feel he understands Physics exceptionally well, he also thinks you do. He grades one problem from the homework, with next to no partial credit. Tests are 4/5 . Next to no partial credit on the tests with no leniency, thinks Physics is your only class. 0/10 take Physics at a JuCo."
3905,586132,1.0,5.0,"Bad English. Very blunt. Only grades one or two questions off homework. Hard grader on tests, draw out diagrams and write out all your steps or youll get no credit. Helpful in office hours but youll need a tutor for sure. Lab for this is very easy. For test use your note card! Doesnt use blackboard to upload grades."
3906,586132,1.0,3.0,"He only grades 1 random problem from the homework and if that problem isn't worked perfectly, 0 for that homework. He grades tests just as tough."
3907,586132,1.0,5.0,If you take him for Physics 1 you will die. He is hard to understand and his test are 5 questions-- 20 pts a piece. good luck.
3908,586132,1.0,5.0,I would not recommend. He gives no partial credit. Our first test average was a 25. Only one person passed (70). Tons of zeros and everyone took it. He does not care. I took him in the summer so maybe that is why he did not care. If you have the chance take someone else.
3909,586132,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Arnoldus is an awesome physics professor. He's very clear, very detailed, very organized. He will not expect you to understand a concept that he himself did not go over or explain. Attendance and dedication to homework are absolutely necessary to pass his course! Plus he's Dutch, which is super cool."
3910,586132,4.0,3.0,"He's a really great professor. I took him for physics 1 during the summer. He is very blunt , but is always willing to help. I was in his office all the time. The exam has 5 questions and he takes the best 4 out of 5. To study rework the homework and in class examples and you'll be fine"
3911,586132,2.0,4.0,"horrible professor. took it in the summer did not curve or any slack. three weeks, 6 test grade"
3912,586132,4.0,4.0,"Teaches extremely well and give you all the information you need to do well in the lectures. All tests are usually 4 problems that cover one section each. All problems are modified HOMEWORK problems. Doesn't use blackboard or webassign, so you will be using the book for homework and turning it in. Possible to get bonus points by doing ALL homework."
3913,586132,2.5,5.0,The guy doesn't care about you. Your just someone he has to teach.
3914,586132,4.0,1.0,He is ok.
3915,586132,1.5,5.0,"If you can take someone else for physics, you'd be wise to do so."
3916,586132,1.0,5.0,DON'T TAKE HIM!
3917,586132,3.5,1.0,"His class is relatively easy as long as you go.  He lets you use your book on quizzes and tests you just have to know the material and where to look.  I don't think attendance is mandatory, but I would recommend you go because all of his notes are on Powerpoint, but he does not explain how to work problems."
3918,586132,1.0,5.0,Mr. Arnoldus is not a good  teacher. Avoid taking his class.
3919,586132,5.0,2.0,"His class is easy if you do your homework and are prepaired for the following class period. He has random quizes, so do your homework before the next class period. If you do your homework, your set. He even lets you use a 3x5 index card for formulas or anything else."
3920,586132,2.0,3.0,"If you do the assigned homework, you'll pass with flying colors.  He doesn't check it, but the test problems are the homework and examples with the numbers changed."
3921,586132,4.0,5.0,His class is hard if you don't do your homework. Probably won't pass if you don't do it.
3922,586132,1.0,5.0,No Comments
3923,586132,1.0,5.0,horrible! just horrible
3924,586134,5.0,1.0,The best teacher I've had in college.
3925,586134,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wolverton is one of the best teachers I have ever had! He has such a kind heart and really cares about his students. The class is easy, especially if you have some Latin experience in high school. Your only grades are a few quizzes and the Final; he drops two of those grades. Attendance isnt mandatory, but he notices when people dont show up."
3926,586134,5.0,2.0,"I have taken Dr. Wolverton for multiple semesters. Anyone who gets below a B in his class DID NOT try. If you have the opportunity to take him, do it."
3927,586134,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Wolverton is the SWEETEST old man. He's funny, and he tells stories all the time. However, he is EXTREMELY old-school which is not surprising considering he's 93. He just stands at the front of the class and talks. He is constantly switching between lecture and stories, so it's hard to listen to him. Lots of handouts and no visual-aids in class"
3928,586134,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Wolverton is funny and passionate. However, this is not an easy A in my opinion. There are no notes on the board during lecture, no slides, and no online material. You simply must listen to the verbal lectures and read the myths. I would recommend using your phone to record the lectures to study later. I think you will easily get a C or higher."
3929,586134,2.0,4.0,"He literally just stands in the class and talks. No visual aids or anything. If this is the type of environment you thrive in, go for it. He literally didn't even open the class online. The syllabus, schedule, nothing was online. He just stands and talks. He seems like a very nice man, Just very old school."
3930,586134,5.0,2.0,"I have been in college for 4 years and Dr. Wolverton is one of the best teachers I have had. If you have the opportunity to take one of his classes please do. He loves the subject and teaching. His lectures are fascinating  and his tests are simple, and are on material that was covered, no surprises. He starts each lecture with historical facts."
3931,586134,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Wolverton is a great teacher and very entertaining. The class was a little confusing because of all the names but if you pay attention, you'll do fine. This isn't an easy A. You have to actually study (unless you are previously obsessed with all mythology). But it's interesting material so it's not that bad."
3932,586134,2.5,2.0,"Cutest little old man ever. However, I have not learned anything all semester."
3933,586134,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wolverton is an amazing professor. I had him for Latin I,II,III,IV and Mythology. I loved every class. Just come to class and pay attention. If you do that there is no reason for getting lower than a B. He gives quizzes every other week, and rarely gives an extensive final."
3934,586134,3.0,2.0,Mr. Wolverton is a cute little old man and he loves mythology and corny jokes. Buy the book because his lectures tend to leave out details that are on the quizzes. And don't take his references to the Bible lightly! He will ask you questions about it on the quizzes.
3935,586134,5.0,2.0,"Great instuctor, reminds me of the days when teachers liked their students and vice versa.  Learned to love this class.  I recommend him highly."
3936,586134,5.0,1.0,Great professor and great guy. He will help you out with quizzes and grades. He makes classes quite interesting.
3937,586134,4.5,1.0,"i think he's a great professor.  If you come to class and listen at all, you will ace the quizes.  He has a quiz every other week or so, and they are just matching, so its nothing to worry about.  Just coming to class and listening was enough for me, i rarely ever studied."
3938,586134,5.0,1.0,I really enjoyed this class.  He was probably one of the funniest professors I have ever had.  He was very interesting.
3939,586134,4.5,1.0,"Mr Wolverton is an interesting teacher. He really knows his Mythology. If you read the book and take good notes in class, you should do well on tests."
3940,586134,3.5,2.0,No Comments
3941,1896855,1.0,5.0,Grades are 90% tests and 10% homework. Peebles test bank is unfair with a massive pool of questions. His textbook is required and written by him. The lectures are incredibly boring and he really doesnt care about the students or the class at all. By far the worst professor I have EVER had at State. Hope he retires soon for the sake of everyone.
3942,1896855,1.0,4.0,"This class is very poorly designed and organized, and the material is plagued with misinformation. He hasn't updated the course material in years, and it shows. He tests you on minute details, so it's an unnecessarily hard class. If you need this class for MCAT, you're better off self-studying. If you need this class for your degree, I'm so sorry."
3943,1896855,1.0,5.0,"This is by far the most difficult class I have ever taken. It doesn't matter how much you prepare and study; you will still come across questions on the test you have zero clue what the answer could be. If you take this class, make sure everyday you spend time preparing for this class. Good luck."
3944,1896855,1.0,1.0,This class is extremely hard. The lectures and following along the workbook make you feel like you are going insane. You get your hopes up for passing the exam and if your anyhting like me cant make about a 48 on any of the exams no matter how much you study and how much extra help you get.
3945,1896855,1.0,5.0,"Nearing the end of my third year of college and currently have C in this class. I made it out of Organic Chem I with an A and Organic II with a B, so this just sucks. The information isn't hard, but the tests are insane. The questions are pulled from a test bank, so everyone has a different test with different difficulties. So unfair. -100/10"
3946,1896855,1.0,5.0,This class is unnecessarily hard. Peebles feeds off of failing people. His lectures will make you think you will do amazing on the exams and when you take the exam you make a 50. He has no compassion and I hope he retires before you have to take him. You will not know how to prepare. His questions come from a pool and are unfairly dispersed.
3947,1896855,1.0,5.0,In my opinion this class and the proffessor are a perfect example of how someone can be good at research and bad at teaching. It was clear to me that when preparing for this course the professor just copied and pasted his old materials that he threw together last spring when COVID first arrived. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.
3948,1896855,1.0,5.0,"Im in this class now and I hate it. Apparently, he intentionally made the class more difficult because it's online now. I've never failed a class but this might be the first. Do not recommend."
3949,1896855,1.0,5.0,"I took this class during the COVID-19 thing, you would think online test would make this class a breeze? Wrong. The test require you to remember details in lecture that he mentions once and doing the homework barely helps your grade (10% overall) or helps you for tests. My condolences if you are reading this knowing you have to take his class."
3950,1896855,2.0,4.0,"The number 1 thing is that he adjusts the grading curve if you have PERFECT lecture and lab attendance. The lab is not a real lab, just more lecture with a TA. They don't always match, and it's sometimes more confusing. But if you study Peebles' slides and the workbook, it's possible to get a good grade."
3951,1896855,1.0,5.0,"do not take genetics at MSU with this professor. He has his TA's teach for him, and even they do not seem to understand what they need to cover."
3952,1896855,3.0,4.0,The class is set up in a strange way where your lab class is just another lecture just taught by a different person. The two are not always on the same page and sometimes they assume that one has covered something that they didn't. The class is pretty average amongst upper level science courses when it comes to difficulty.
3953,1896855,1.0,5.0,"You will study for this class or you will fail. If you are want to learn genetics and have the time and will to teach yourself, this is for you. Otherwise, take human genetics."
3954,1896855,1.0,5.0,Grade is 90% tests 10% homework. Test questions involve things only said in lecture so attendance is important. Review sheets pose over 90 questions for a 25 question test and are not very helpful. Lab is basically just more lecture. His lectures are all over the place and so unorganized. This class is a mess!
3955,1896855,1.0,5.0,"This was my first B in any science class (ochem,phy, bio, etc). Tests included random facts that you might not find in any assigned material, rather than testing your deep understanding of the science. My advice: if youre premed, learn MCAT genetics on your own. The time it would take to record/transcribe lectures to get an A isnt worth it"
3956,1896855,2.0,5.0,"I have never struggled with a class more. I received a B in Chem 1 and A in Chem 2 and barely made a D in this class. When studying the material will make sense but on the tests, the questions asks the most detailed questions on the smalls things, so understanding the concepts will not help that much. You have to memorize everything that he says."
3957,1896855,1.0,5.0,Avoid this class if you can. I took this as an elective and it was extremely hard. You have a workbook for the class except he lectures using his own slides. Tests are only 25 questions but you never know what he is going to ask. He gives a review online but it usually has around 100 questions on it. Completely unorganized and do not recommend.
3958,1896855,2.0,4.0,"I managed to ace BIO 1 and 2 with flying colors but really struggled to pull off A's and B's in this class. The material wasn't formatted in a way that made retention effective and the textbook was of no use at all! I did, however, see a massive increase in my scores after recording his lectures. Push comes to shove, ppl (me 2) will always complain"
3959,1896855,1.0,5.0,"Took this class as an elective and it was horrible. The non-credit producing lab is actually just 3 more hours of horrible lecture done by a TA. Avoid this class at all cost. For someone who gets A's in all other classes, this class was ridiculously, and unnecessarily hard. He will jump in and apply information without giving background to anything"
3960,1896855,3.0,5.0,"His test are very difficult.  He now offers quizzes that will help you on the test.  If you study the quizzes plus the material, you should be okay.  Make sure you go to lab.  My lab instructor, Katie, is AMAZING!! She explains things so well.  I go to her for clarification most times."
3961,1896855,1.0,4.0,"Presents relatively easy material in a very difficult and confusing manner. Workbook is required to buy, but it is just as scattered and disorganized as he is. Very monotone lectures that drag on. He only has one way of explaining the material, so if you don't understand, its not worth going to office hours. Hope you can teach yourself!"
3962,1896855,2.0,5.0,"I agree with what the other rater said. You think you get it for a little while but there's just so much information that he tries to cram into one test. And if you start out bad, you might as well withdraw because everything builds on everything else. And good luck getting a TA that speaks understandable English. Some people do well, but not many."
3963,1896855,1.5,3.0,Painfully boring. His tests are only 25 question multiple choice which sounds nice but you're almost guaranteed to miss 4 or 5 questions because he asks about little details that are easily overlooked. Not a good teacher and you can't teach yourself from the book because he follows his own study guide which doesn't explain things any better
3964,2724256,2.0,2.0,Arrives late for class and does expects students to stay late. Lectures are not useful. Does not communicate deadlines. Unorganized. 
3965,2724256,4.0,3.0,"He is very professional when it comes to interacting with people. The problem comes is that he is not organized when it comes to distributing HW/test/assignments. You might go 3 or 4 weeks of nothing then have 5 assignments due in a week. On the plus side he is extremely willing to help any who ask him, so expect to spend time asking questions."
3966,2724256,4.0,4.0,"TFL should be an easy A, but Omar grades pretty tough. He graded the first 2 labs within two weeks of the start of the class, but the remaining 7 labs were only graded the final week of class. Labs were easy during class, but the lab reports were tough, especially with his grading. Make sure you spend the time and energy on each one or will get B/C"
3967,2724256,4.0,3.0,"The way he lectures can be difficult. He tends to write a ton of notes and work very few actual problems. So, when homework comes around you don't know how to start or finish. On the plus side he is a generous grader and is willing to help any student that comes to him during office hours. Thermo 1 is a difficult course, but he made it doable."
3968,2724256,1.0,5.0,"Awful Teacher. Does not do any worked out examples during class time, yet expects to do homework without sufficient explanation on how to work out the problems given."
3969,2175394,4.0,5.0,"From what I have heard from my peers, Seay is one of the easier ones. DO THE CENGAGE TILL YOU GET A 100%. The cengage is worth basically 3 exam grades, which can make up for how you do on the test. The test are hard but study, do your best, and do the hw and you will be fine. I got a 60 &amp; 70 on exams and still got a mid-B! GO TO OFFICE HOURS!"
3970,2175394,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Seay gets a bad rap because the course is heavy and he doesn't baby his students. He's actually a great instructor and he will help you in anyway he can, if you ask for it. As long as you really know the material, his tests aren't that bad. BE SURE TO GET THE TEXT BOOK AND THE STUDY GUIDE BOOK TOO! This saved my grade for sure!!"
3971,2257323,1.0,4.0,Ms. Bostick is a pretty terrible teacher. She is not very approachable. If you have a question she will not answer it. You will have to completely teach yourself in her class. If you have any issue with your autocad she will tell you to go to the IT department. She is terrible with computers and seems to barely know how to function on autocad. 
3972,2257323,1.0,5.0,"She doesnt teach well, nor is she accessible outside of class in office hours. She doesnt seem to know how to use her email either, considering she never responds. She wont help you in class either."
3973,2257323,5.0,4.0,Ms. Bostick is a very nice lady. You will spend a lot of time outside of class doing her homework assignments. She is very willing to help. Does not have a not of office hours due to the fact she has another job. If you put forth effort you shouldnt have a problem coming out with an A or B
3974,2257323,2.0,5.0,"Lisa Bostick is far too old school to be teaching this class. It is heavily autoCAD based, and she is barely proficient. She gives lots of homework, and is very unclear about due dates. The homework is very time consuming. She is unreachable by email, as she doesnt know how to use it. She rarely shows up to office hours. Do not take this professor"
3975,2257323,2.0,3.0,"Mrs. Bostick is a very nice lady, but its time for her to stop teaching. Even though she had posted office hours she was rarely in her office during the times. She also gave an excess amount of homework without barely explaining he material and expected it the next class period."
3976,2257323,4.0,3.0,Bositk is pretty cool. She is really funny and wants her students to do well. She is kind of hard to understand at first though. AutoCAD is a pain to learn in the first place and she didn't make it any easier. If you talk to her in class and get on her good side you're set.
3977,2527670,1.0,4.0,"This professor talks in a very monotoned voice the entire time. He makes the class super hard. He doesnt really explain things in depth. If ask a question he basically repeats what he has already stated, which ends up not even answering the question. I would never take this professor again."
3978,2527670,2.0,3.0,Is a very by the rules type of guy. Gives a one point grade every class so you have to go. Talks in a very even tone that makes It hard to stay awake. Takes a typically relevantly easy class and makes it more difficult than it should be.
3979,1814988,4.5,3.0,He teaches at Delta State now and is an awesome professor. Easy to get along with and goes out of his way to help you if you ask for it. Really a great teacher.
3980,1814988,5.0,3.0,James McCormick is passionate about statistics and is one of the most helpful and friendly of MSU's faculty.  He gives his cell phone number to students and will even come to campus in the summer when he is off to help any MSU student even if they are not in his class.  He should be given an award. He should get an award.
3981,2544078,5.0,3.0,I had her for med term & foundations my freshman year. Mrs term is ridiculously easy. All of the tests are online & so are the quizzes. She will come in on halloween with mascara all over her face and tell you shes a tired grad student. That joke is awful but she is funny & her accent is cute. Easy A.
3982,2544078,5.0,1.0,"She's looks very young and a PhD student herself. She's also British so that makes things interesting. She's super nice. The class is super easy and everything is online, but don't skip class as she will give access codes at the end of the class for her online quizzes. The class might be big, but it's lively and a lot of fun. Also really easy"
3983,2011617,5.0,4.0,Dr. Woodroofe makes a challenging course even more challenging but not without giving you ways to adjust. He has these optional study sessions outside of class that are extremely helpful. This class would have been very difficult if I hadn't gone to them. He really wants us to understand the material and works very hard to make sure we've got it.
3984,2011617,3.0,4.0,"I like Dr. Russ. He's a great guy. I only went to class on test days and he didn't care. I didn't really like his teaching style, he seemed to make things more confusing. I ended up doing better than most people in the class, and learned straight from the internet. He's a grad student teacher, and has trouble ""dumbing things down"" for undergrads."
3985,2011617,1.5,4.0,"Pros: nice guy, accessible outside of class, wants students to learn, great mustache   Cons: creates unrealistic expectations. Tests are ridiculously hard to where  a 50 is curved to an A sometimes. If you are not good at the material he just assumes you are not working hard enough.  Homework is impossible. "
3986,2421218,3.0,4.0,"Dr. B's lecture is chill, you can do whatever you want during the time but you have to go b/c there are lecture quizzes almost every class (you can google the answers). The test are difficult but she allows test corrections ( you can google the answers). BUT the weekly lab quizzes are impossible to study for and basically makes it a latin class."
3987,2453989,1.0,5.0,There really isn't anything good to say. Unless a career in programming is your future this class shouldn't be required. Unless you're already fluent in c++ then this course is taught like an honors course. Very little explanation and not very responsive to emails.
3988,2453989,3.0,3.0,I think Aubrey gets a bad wrap. I think he is very clear on what material will be on the exams. You can ask him questions and he will tell you what will and will not be tested. All of his test are EXACTLY like his quizzes/exercises (and he tells you this). Programs can be difficult but he will help you generously when you need it. Ask questions!
3989,2453989,1.0,5.0,"Knight's lectures are easy to understand in class, but the information covered in the lecture is not what you will be tested on. Knight expects his students to be able to code for overcomplicated program assignments with little to no guidance. He makes succeeding in his class feel impossible. He loves being the smartest person in the room. "
3990,2453989,1.0,5.0,The first test was extremely hard and is a scare tactic to get people to drop. Programs are harder than they need to be. He humiliated a girl in front of the class cause she didnt understand BSTs. Doesnt understand personal space either. Someone on here said he pauses at random times he does and class is hard to understand majority of the time.
3991,2453989,1.0,4.0,"If you have any auditory processing disorder, this class is not for you. The notes posted are awful, with little to no real code examples. In his lectures, he makes pauses at awkward points in his sentences, making it virtually impossible for me to understand what he is saying. I am using google as my teacher for this class."
3992,2453989,4.0,4.0,"When it comes to CSE, Aubrey Knight is definitely one of the more difficult professors you can have. That being said, he is genuinely a good teacher and cares about his students. Though he is prone to unrelated ramblings and dry humor that doesn't always hit, there is no way you can blame the professor if you don't understand the material."
3993,2453989,5.0,3.0,"This guy is a real gem. Very fun to learn from, and he makes material easy to digest. He may seem a little bit hard to read at first, but once you go to a few classes, you start to understand that hes *always* joking."
3994,2453989,5.0,5.0,His programs took me literally 3 solid days every time (always got 100 but the program grades are very important). Dropped another class to have enough time. NEVER could have done them without so much of his help which he patiently and infinitely provided even on the weekend with quick replies. So hard but awesome teacher and learned a lot.
3995,2453989,5.0,3.0,Fair grader. Clear and understandable presentation of the material. Nice man who likes answering questions and helping students. Felt bad when he uncovered the cheating going on (cutting and pasting hello world level code like idiots). Gives fun labs that half the class didn't do
3996,2453989,1.0,5.0,"Aubrey is horrible. He does not have a good way of explaining material. He expects you to already be proficient in C++ when you arrive on the first day of Data Structures, and always makes sure to remind everyone that he is the smartest person in the room."
3997,2453989,4.0,4.0,"Mr. Knight's class wasn't very hard other than the tests. You really have to study everything you've learned for the tests. The labs and notes were kind of vague at times, but he told us that he will be changing that next semester because of the poor class evaluations he was getting. He cares about the class and knows what he is talking about."
3998,2453989,3.0,4.0,"Semester split by COVID-19. Every week is a programming lab, some are quite challenging and should be started as early as possible. If taken in person he is a fine teacher, though boring and hard to follow at times. He is always in his office, use this. Online he has terrible communication and lectures, grade went from an A to a C going online."
3999,2453989,5.0,4.0,"There is no doubt that Knight will make you work. The programs are difficult enough that they will make you think. However, he is very fair. He is willing to answer questions and is willing to work with you as long as you are willing to put in the work and are willing to ask the questions. He will even answer the most basic questions for you."
4000,2453989,5.0,4.0,"He's a solid teacher. I took him for Discrete Structures and Data Structures and while there are easier teachers, he makes sure you know the material. By far the most accessible teacher I've had if I needed help and would basically give you the test problems if you went to his office and asked him for help. He gives weekly quizzes but drops lowest."
4001,2453989,3.0,3.0,"Really good for access outside of class. Answers questions well. Treats you as inferior in terms of knowledge and can be offputting. Programs give good programming experience, but can be challenging."
4002,2453989,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Knight excels at explaining the concepts of data structures so that the student understands exactly what the algorithm is. The catch is that when it comes to actually programming that algorithm, he does not give the code. He is, however, very helpful in office hours, where his policy is if he's in his office, he can help. I would recommend him."
4003,2453989,1.0,4.0,"The best way to describe Aubrey Knight is that he has to be the smartest guy in the room. If his knowledge is ever in question, his ego puffs up like a dragon about to unleash hellfire. He definitely knows what he is talking about, but he also knows he is smarter than you and does not let you forget that. He is easy to reach outside of class."
4004,2453989,3.0,5.0,"Took his class as an introduction to programming in C. Very thankful I only had to take one. The clarity of his lectures were sometimes great, and sometimes you would find yourself very lost very quickly. He was very unorganized and I found myself feeling very dumb when I would visit during office hours."
4005,2453989,5.0,3.0,"Programs were easier than most and had ample amount of time to complete them. Tests primarily came from slides/study guides. Be sure to do the homework and come to class for quizzes. Class is definitely not hard, only because the The Knight makes it that way."
4006,2421242,5.0,1.0,"This class is a wonderful course for freshmen to take. Summerlin is a very caring guy who wants you to succeed. I learned a lot about the university and different resources, and Im very glad I took him. Its also a GPA booster for those who need it. This guy is a real gem at MSU"
4007,2421242,5.0,3.0,the best
4008,2421242,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher, clear directions and explanations. His lectures are enjoyable and full of dry humor. He uploads videos that walk you through how to work some of the software he teaches which is EXTREMELY helpful. Great guy 10/10 I wish he taught all of my LA classes."
4009,2494976,5.0,3.0,"all around amazing teacher. she makes the class interesting, and she is very understanding. as long as you put in the work, you will definitely pass."
4010,2494976,5.0,3.0,"Would highly recommend. She genuinely cares, she's young so she's a fun teacher. If you show up and do what she asks then you should be fine."
4011,2535939,3.0,2.0,Very straightforward. Just stay on top of work and you will be fine.
4012,2535939,5.0,3.0,Loved taking ADS 1111-01 with Dr. Blanton. Hes a great teacher and really cares about his students.
4013,2716166,5.0,3.0,"Her assignments and tests directly reflected the material learned in class. She praised participation in class and never made someone feel bad if they gave the wrong answer. I was also nervous to take this class because of my public speaking fear, but she never pressured us or dropped our grades bc of nervous mistakes. Overall great teacher!!"
4014,2208266,1.0,5.0,"He knows his material; he just can't teach it well. The midterm tests count for 69-70% of your overall grade. If you don't do well on the midterm tests, don't even worry about passing. You can make all of the A's on assignments and complete all extra cred, doesnt help much. Do yourself a favor and take it elsewhere. "
4015,2208266,3.0,5.0,"This class was very hard for me because I never knew exactly what to study for the tests, which are a huge chunk of your grade. Weekly online homework. Tests are honorlocked. Lectures were hard to understand because he talks really fast with an accent."
4016,2208266,5.0,2.0,"There were weekly assignments due each week that were not hard at all. All assignments had unlimited attempts. There are 4 exams. Since I took this class online, all of the exams were online through Honorlock. He gives extra credit after each test. Do not buy the book. I would definitely recommend taking this class online, not in person."
4017,2208266,3.0,2.0,"Very knowledgable but his accent makes things difficult. The tests are pretty close to together and are weighted very heavily. A ton of studying is required for this class and if you don't, you won't pass. He does offer a plethora of extra credit to recover points (the only reason I passed). Super sweet guy, wouldn't want him as a teacher again."
4018,2208266,1.0,5.0,"This class was terrible. I took it online and the only grades were homework and tests. Even when I studied and did the homework, the tests were almost impossible. I ended up having to drop that class so it didn't ruin my GPA. I had to take macro at my town's community college. I do not recommend this class. "
4019,2208266,2.0,5.0,"So hard. This class was online and the tests were about 80% of your overall grade but they were literally impossible. The questions were so different from the lectures and had multiple correct answers. Coming from a straight A student I STRUGGLED. He gave out extra credit though, probably because everyone needed it. Tests are honorlocked!!"
4020,2208266,2.0,5.0,Dr. Gonzalez is very nice however he is not the best teacher. His lectures are very confusing and not well explained. The tests are very different from what he goes over during lecture. This class is extremely difficult and you will basically have to teach yourself everything. Overall I would not take his class again. If you do good luck.
4021,2208266,2.0,4.0,"IThe tests were weighted heavily, and they were very hard. Everyone had different quesitons, so some people's tests were harder than others. The questions are confusing, and there are ones that seem like they have multiple right answers. He gives his in person students a lot more special treatment when it comes to bonus than his online students."
4022,2208266,2.0,2.0,"No one goes to class. All tests were online, except the final. Extra credit quizzes were given for students who showed up. Tests were the main assignments worth around 25% a piece. Homework was easy and multiple tries were given. Easy to reach out to for help."
4023,2208266,1.0,4.0,"I could not define macroeconomics. I finished with a B somehow, after reading the textbook and teaching myself enough to do well on the final. This man lives and breathes economics, but he is not a great teacher for the non-economic minded. Take a different social science if you have a choice."
4024,2208266,1.0,3.0,had a 89.45 in the class. Asked him if there was anything I could do to round it up. He said he cant discuss that and now has been ignoring all my emails and now its too late to change the grade.
4025,2208266,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Gonzalez was not my easiest class, but he wasn't my hardest. He said we wouldn't need a textbook, but I definitely needed it to pass his tests. I had to teach myself everything once we got past the first test. He is sort of difficult to understand, but he was nice and easy to reach out to. He did offer extra credit for those who went to class!"
4026,2208266,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Gonzalez was a solid choice for macro. He made going to lecture enjoyable by keeping the class engaged with jokes/videos explaining the topics in class. Toward the end of the semester offered 3 pt extra credit quizzes in class that added onto test grades, as well as an optional final to replace lowest test grade."
4027,2208266,3.0,3.0,"He mostly taught off of powerpoints. It wasn't a hard class if you do alright teaching yourself the material. The tests will sneak up on you if you don't study for them, but he did offer extra credit if you went to class &amp; we got a chance to replace a test grade at the end of the semester. Overall, it wasn't a terrible class."
4028,2208266,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Gonzalez pretty much lectured right off powerpoint slides. You do somewhat have to teach yourself the material. He is a very nice man, and offers some extra credit if you go to class. If you are not used to his accent or sit in the back, he can be hard to understand."
4029,2208266,1.0,3.0,"Worst prof. I've ever had. Good luck reaching him at all. Class was asynchronous online and he didn't respond to a single email I sent him, and everyone else in the class complained about the lack of communication. He also makes canvas hard to navigate. Save yourself the effort and DO NOT TAKE HIM."
4030,2208266,1.0,3.0,"Honestly, I haven't seen or heard from this man personally all semester. He does not teach. This class is easy if you let Quizlet take it for you. If you intend to learn anything DO NOT TAKE HIM. The modules tab on canvas would randomly disappear and all of the powerpoints would just be unassessable, especially right before a test."
4031,2208266,2.0,5.0,"Lectures don't include many problem basically a repetition of the book. Tests are hard, you won't find the answers online most of the time. So it is best to be prepared and study hard before them. Even though attendance is not necessary, you should go. Because sometimes he has extra-credit pop quizzes in class"
4032,2208266,3.0,4.0,This class was difficult because math &amp; economics aren't my strong suits. It was very hard for me to understand a lot of what he said because of his accent and the thick mask he wore. He was also very slow to respond to emails like I asked about an assignment I had not completed and he responded 3 weeks later... but otherwise he was a good teacher!
4033,2208266,5.0,1.0,"took for micro and macro econ online, was super easy. he posts some material on canvas and a couple of lectures. He has weekly canvas meetings. His quizzes and homework on canvas are easy."
4034,2208266,4.0,2.0,I could barely understand him because of his accent but his class is easy. Or at least online it is.
4035,2208266,4.0,2.0,He does not really interact with his students and sometimes I had a hard time understanding the information in his lectures but I managed to get an A. The tests are pretty easy.
4036,2208266,2.0,2.0,"The online version of this class is not great. While the test, quizzes, and homework are all fairly simple, he does not put in much effort to actually teach the class. He barely puts any information on canvas. The final is not optional!!! 3 tests and a final."
4037,2208266,3.0,3.0,"Basically, he posts some material on canvas and adds a couple of lectures. He has weekly canvas meetings. His quizzes and homework on canvas are fairly easy. The difficulty of his tests just depends on if you studied or not. Sometimes he offers extra credit to make up half of your missed points on tests. The final is NOT optional."
4038,2208266,4.0,2.0,"Failed the first test, but he allows for extra credit to earn back at most half the points you missed. The next test I studied just the short handout he posted on Canvas to review for the test and made a 100. He does not tolerate scanning and leaving class and demands your attention when you are in class (no phones/earbuds)."
4039,2208266,2.0,1.0,"The material itself is very easy. Mostly just common sense. He was okay as a lecturer when we were actually going to class, but I was so disappointed with how he handled the online aspect. I thought he cared about his students, but I guess I was wrong. Is it that difficult to record lectures even just once a week?"
4040,2208266,3.0,2.0,"This class is an easy A, but I didn't enjoy it very much. I had to teach myself everything with youtube videos and the textbook. His tests aren't hard, but I don't think I would have been well prepared if I relied solely on his lectures and slides. In short, I did fine, but I don't think it was very valuable and I wouldn't take the professor again."
4041,2208266,5.0,4.0,"Not a hard class if you study. The textbook isnt required, but I used it and it definitely helps to make an A. Ive made a 100 on every test so far and I normally study the quizzes he puts out (take it 3 times because the questions change), the end of the chapter textbook questions, and memorize all of the formulas in the notes and youll be good"
4042,2208266,2.0,3.0,"Not that this means a lot to anyone beyond this semester, but his COVID-19 class plan is literally just to not teach. He is making us do HW and tests without his guidance, using only the textbook, and no supplemental material from him. He isn't doing lecture videos or Zoom or anything. He could not care less about his students tbh"
4043,2208266,3.0,2.0,Boring but easy. Just read the book a little and do the homework and you should be good. He gives a lot of extra credit on exams.
4044,2208266,4.0,3.0,"As a teacher, he's great. Lectures the entire time. Go to class because extra credit is tied to attendance and he sometimes does WS for points. The test are tough but with extra credit you can make an A if you studied. HW is online and on Quizlet. He says that you don't need the book but you need it if you want an A."
4045,2208266,4.0,2.0,"The only bad thing I have to say is that he is very monotone. Otherwise, he gives many examples in class to back up his lectures. Hes great!! Yes, he has an accent, but after the first few classes you can easily understand him."
4046,2208266,4.0,3.0,Respectable. Hard working. Exams are easy if you use Mr. Cliffords supplementary material. Recommend.
4047,2208266,3.0,5.0,"The homework is on Quizlet. The exams are impossible. I studied the homework, practice quizzes, lecture notes, and quizlet and still made a 70s. IDk what else to study to do better. Lecture is extremely boring and hard to pay attention to. If you get it you get it, if you don't you don't. Some people did good and some people did bad, no in between."
4048,2208266,3.0,4.0,Had for macroeconomics. He does have an accent and the lectures are very boring. He had study sessions before some of the tests that did help a lot. At the end of the semester he bumped up my grade a decent amount. He is very nice if you approach him outside of class.
4049,2208266,5.0,3.0,Dr. Gonzalez is a very fair professor. Textbook is not needed since he only tests off of his lectures and online homeworks/quizzes. You can purchase a later version of it if you would like. His extra credit is above and beyond what most professors are willing to provide. Once you can get past his accent his class is a breeze.
4050,2208266,3.0,5.0,"The tests are really hard so just study basically everything. He gave extra credit after the first and second test which saved my grade. He's available outside of class but his accent is super thick so I couldn't understand much in class, just get a tutor honestly and it pulled me up a lot."
4051,2208266,2.0,4.0,He just can not teach in my opinion. The test are very hard and material covered in class does not match. It is hard to understand him in. I went to him multiple times seeking out assistance on how I can better improve and how to effectively take his. Studying the way he told me to study &amp; that still was not enough. Would not suggest him to anyone.
4052,2208266,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Gonzalez is a fair teacher who gives out  helpful practice and extra credit opportunities all the time, which literally saved my grade. The textbook is good to have for the homeworks as all the questions come straight from there. He does have a thick accent which can be difficult to understand at times, but he is willing to help and explain."
4053,2208276,3.0,2.0,"Goodridge is a good enough teacher. His lectures can be a bit boring, but they are very informative, and he always posts the slides. I never used the textbook for this class."
4054,1364505,4.0,3.0,"Very good teacher. Helpful, and willing to meet after class or during office hours to give extra help."
4055,1659421,1.5,5.0,"This guy is an awful professor. For intro to real estate, I figured we'd get a taste of material. Really wish I would've been able to take these classes before he came to UW Whitewater. He makes the class WAY too in depth for an introductory finance elective. Extremely unhelpful out of class. Incompetent with technology. Going to class is pointless"
4056,1593901,4.0,2.0,While the rest of the chemistry department seems to be out to get you this professor actually went out of his way to explain things in ways that made since he also gave helpful test taking tips and provided access to supplementary instruction during lecture. 
4057,1593901,5.0,3.0,He is very dry and sarcastic but in a good way. He will makes learning the material easy with entertaining lectures. The class isnt hard if you pay attention. Most of the low reviews are people who dont have a sense of humor or asked stupid questions and got stupid answers.
4058,1593901,2.0,4.0,"Emerson is very knowledgeable and well prepared for his classes. However, he goes through lectures quickly and rarely allows for questions. I often felt unprepared for his tests and the class test average was rarely above a 66%."
4059,1593901,4.0,3.0,"Emerson is a solid choice for Chem 1. He posts the lecture slides online along w a copy of the textbook. While attendance isn't mandatory, he does work out practice problems in lecture. He is normally quick to respond to emails and is always willing to help. Overall a good choice."
4060,1593901,5.0,4.0,"You have homeworks for every chapter, but its nothing crazy. He does a really good job of explaining the material. Pretty chill dude from my experience in class."
4061,1593901,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Emerson always delivers quality lectures while still managing time to work through all forms of practice problems. He's very accessible outside of class, and is very helpful and obviously wants to see his students succeed. If you show up to lecture and try, gen chem with him really won't be hard."
4062,1593901,1.0,4.0,"Don' take him, but all the chem professors suck."
4063,1593901,1.0,5.0,Hes very rude and doesnt care at all. Please take someone else! Test are extremely hard and he doesnt thoroughly explain problems in his lectures.
4064,1593901,1.0,5.0,Take it with someone else and save ur self the stress
4065,1593901,1.0,4.0,"He's dull and rude if you ever try to talk to him with an ego out of this world. If you can, take Nettles because she is better. Chemistry is hard, no need for it to be even harder because the teacher could care less if you pass or not."
4066,1593901,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Emerson definitely had high expectations for this class, and there are constantly homework assignments and take-home quizzes due. What's frustrating is that he often does not post the homework online to where we can submit it when he says it will be due. moves test dates around; tricky test questions; not personable or a good communicator"
4067,1593901,2.0,4.0,"You will not walk out of this class with a solid understanding of inorganic chemistry unless you teach yourself from the textbook. He has a pretty good understanding of the material he teaches, though I believe he could convey the information in a more effective manner especially when compared to other instructors. Average prof at best."
4068,1593901,5.0,3.0,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Dr. Emerson's class. He is very caring and devoted to his job and students. He is easy accessible after class and keeps his office door open. Make sure to seek him down because he will not answer emails. He is willing to go above and class is not mandatory but if you do not attend you will be lost.
4069,1593901,5.0,5.0,"His class was great! I took him over the summer, and while we were covering a lot of material, he was always accessible. He worked so many example problems that I felt comfortable with the math and with the concepts. I made an A in his class, and studying and reading the textbook is a must. I would definitely take his class again."
4070,1593901,4.5,4.0,Was very thorough with examples and was willing to help anyone who asked for it.
4071,1593901,3.5,3.0,He is a good teacher.  Chem II is a really tough course. I went to his office hours a few times and he was helpful.  The homework is online and picky about the answers which gets annoying.
4072,1593901,3.5,3.0,"This class went well. I like this teacher; he isn't as bad as everyone says he is. He's a good teacher; works a lot of problems. Sometimes his tests have unfair questions, but for the most part they are good and fair."
4073,1593901,1.0,5.0,"Avoid this teacher at all costs. Everything about him and this class is hard and difficult. The homework is difficult, the tests are near impossible, and he is not a very good teacher. He does not explain things very well and he goes way too fast. DO NOT TAKE!"
4074,1593901,1.5,5.0,"He is a tough teacher. If you want to pass his class you will have to go find help some where else, because he is no help. His homework assignments are way too long and extremely difficult. If you have the choice to take someone else take someone else. "
4075,1593901,5.0,2.0,"I dont understand the bad reviews, I took him Summer13. Summer is ofcourse fast but he restructured and had 11 quizzes and 2 test. This helps your grade dramatically, and 40 points for attendance. He was always in his office to answer my questions. No MC test in summer, he just explained it so well and worked so many problems. Take him in Summer."
4076,1593901,3.0,1.0,Emerson does not really go into any detail other than what's on the slides and his tests were hard as far as content but the scale made it a class where you can obtain an easy A. He drops your lowest test grade (including final) and replaces this with your highest grade. I would definitely recommend him.
4077,1593901,1.0,5.0,"Emerson is an awful teacher. On my first day of class he told us he doesn't care what grade we make because either way he gets paid. He does not care if you understand the material, and he obviously does not do well at explaining. He expects you to already know all of the material. Take ANY other teacher if you can."
4078,1593901,1.0,5.0,"Mr. Emerson is a terrible teacher. He doesn't make his own slide shows and doesn't know what is on them. His was of showing how to do something is copying whats on the slide EXACTLY on the board. You are basically on your own to learn the class, the book is not used unless you use it And his tests are very hard. I would suggest a different teacher."
4079,2683445,5.0,1.0,Loved him as a teacher! He was understanding. The group project and tests were majority of your grades. If you do bad on one of those it was your own fault.
4080,2683445,5.0,1.0,"Very easy class and a cool professor. The group project is fun and easier if you get it out of the way at the beginning of the semester. It does count for a large chunk of your grade but he's lenient on grading. Discussion questions and quizzes every week but fully online, including exams. "
4081,2683445,5.0,2.0,His lectures were always laid back and interesting to listen to. 
4082,2683445,5.0,2.0,He's a very nice professor. He gave extra credit opportunities for attending class.
4083,2683445,5.0,2.0,He gave extra credit and always put the course in a very easy way to navigate. quizzes and discussion boards were due every week but very easy to understand.
4084,2683445,4.0,1.0,Just do the assignment ago. This class is really easy! I didn't ever have to ask the proff for anything but his assignments were fair .
4085,2683445,5.0,1.0,"took for mang. info. systems online, was super easy. quiz and discussion every week that are very easy. mid-term and final exam that are super easy. would definitely take over any other professor doesn't get much easier than this professor"
4086,2421306,5.0,2.0,"Ming Hong is incredibly laid back with cool asian-mom energy. Shes super kind, energetic, encouraging, and genuinely helpful. You can infinitely resubmit any drawing you complete and get full credit, so long as you submit it on time the first time. In addition to being a lenient grader. The class itself requires some patience, but if you try its ez"
4087,2421306,5.0,4.0,"Ming is so helpful when it comes to not knowing how to draw. Shes a very easy going person is always willing to help. If you do not finish a project by the due date she still allows you to turn it in, critique it, grade it, and then you have until the end of the semester to bring up the grade on that project."
4088,2421306,5.0,2.0,"Ming was amazing as my drawing professor. She really does care about helping you succeed and does not expect you to have prior drawing experience. As long as you put forth the effort, you will make a good grade and because everyone in the class is on a different skill level, the grading is based on personal achievement."
4089,2421306,5.0,3.0,Ming is an incredibly cool Drawing 1 teacher. You do not have to know how to draw to be in this class. Ming is very willing to help and encourages you to do your best. I can honestly say my drawing skills have improved and helped me in my major.
4090,2421306,5.0,4.0,"Ming is a great professor! I was scared of taking drawing at first, because I thought I could not draw, but with each project, Ming helped me get better. She loves to help you on your project if you are struggling and she is a literal gem. She knows what she is doing and I wouldn't be as prepared for drawing 2 as I am now if it wasn't for her."
4091,2593342,4.0,3.0,"Ms. Creel is a very sweet teacher and is willing to help. She always wanted to do what was a best for us! Her classes and lectures may not have always been the most enjoyable to listen too, but she never kept us the whole class time which was nice! Turn in and do all your work and you will get a good grade!"
4092,2224710,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor. Actually cares about her students. Gives great lectures and is realistic when it comes to writing papers. Would highly recommend her for anybody needing EN1113
4093,2224710,5.0,2.0,Great teacher! Gives great feedback and is really funny! Had for comp II and would take her class again if given the chance
4094,2224710,5.0,1.0,Best english teachee for comp 1 explains what to do on papers thoroughly! Would absolutely take again.
4095,2224710,5.0,4.0,Wasn't an easy class but everything was graded fair and very quickly. Had my doubts at the beginning of the semester but they were gone by the third week. Definitely would recommend.
4096,2224710,3.0,4.0,"I really liked this prof. as a person, but she graded kinda hard. easy class but you have to work for it."
4097,2749000,1.0,4.0,Basically just teaching yourself from the textbook. Don't take a class with her if you want an actual professor.
4098,2749000,1.0,4.0,Loves to hear herself talk.
4099,2749000,1.0,5.0,BUY THE BOOK if you take her (even if she says you don't have to)because it is the only way you will pass. Had to curve EVERY SINGLE test at least 30 points. Her tests do not match the lecture she gives which her literally reading off a powerpoint. rambles about pointless things. She makes this class way too difficult and I advise to never take her
4100,2749000,1.0,5.0,"READS PRESENTATIONS WORD FOR WORD! TERRIBLE TEACHER OVERALL, GRADE SUPER HARD! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL! TEST AND QUIZZES ARE ALL THROUGH HONOR LOCK!  "
4101,2749000,2.0,4.0,"Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss. Her tests were very difficult and she had to curve them by like 30-40 points. She told us we would get open note/two attempts/and a drop test to improve our grades. She then tells us she never said anything about a drop test grade. Tests=HARD and textbook based after telling us to not get it if we couldn't afford it."
4102,2749000,2.0,5.0,Uses honorlock for every quiz and exam. Makes it way harder than what needs to be. 
4103,2749000,1.0,4.0,"Horrible teacher! When I took her for learning she said don't buy the book, but on the test there was material that she didn't lecture on because it came from the book. She rambles a lot about nothing during lecture. Test are very unorganized. Instead of teaching rambled (abt 30 minutes) about how she hated groupme and quizlet instead of teaching"
4104,2749000,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this professor. All tests and quizzes are honorlocked. The study guides are all very long and often do not have anything to do with the test, or they have wrong answers on them. More people fail this class than pass this class so I recommend not taking this professor if you want a good grade."
4105,2749000,1.0,4.0,She is absolutely the worst. She is horrible at teaching and gives incredibly hard tests. Her study guides do not help at all. Her quizzes every week are honorlocked. Good luck if you take her.
4106,1405531,1.0,5.0,"Huge ego. Doesn't cover the material well. Attempts to cover entire chapters in 1 class period. Does not return the graded homework before testing on the same material. Success on the homework does not indicate success on the exams. Poor attitude. Dismissive of student concerns, questions. No extra credit, no projects, no practical application. "
4107,1405531,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Wahidi is the hardest choice you'll have for fluids, but stick it out with him. I went into the final calculating what I'll need to even pass, and with an A on the exam, he curved my (at best) barely a B- to and A. The lectures do not help (filled with irrelevant info about his research), but the HW and practice problems do."
4108,1405531,1.0,5.0,Dr. Wahidi creates test that are unreasonable to complete in the time given. He expects you to read the book and be prepared for heavy lectures but does not explain well. The tests given are extremely difficult with a class average of about 40%. He is unwilling to help outside of class and is unreasonable with his expectations.
4109,1405531,1.0,5.0,He is the worst professor that I have come across in college. His tests are difficult even if you read the entire book he is using. He is never available in his office for questions. He grades tough. Class average (30’s). I would stay away from him at all costs. It’s amazing he is still employed at a university. His goal is to tank your GPA. 
4110,1405531,1.0,5.0,"If the solution isnt like the way he teaches, hell give you hard time when grading your test. In all: this is just a entry level course for undergraduate but he treated us like were in graduate school."
4111,1405531,1.0,5.0,calculation steps when sloving the problems and ask you to solve it out when you back home. A lot of the time we were so confused back home when tried to solve the problems due to lack of class problem notes. Hes got awful attitude towards to students who question him in class where we took it as a way to learn. If the solution isnt like the way
4112,1405531,1.0,5.0,"We don't know if he will curve the grade at the end of the course. Even if he does, it won't help many people. Most of his class time were boring. Not that the lecture was but the way he presented. He just sit there the whole time and talked through the slides and examples, rarely works out the whole problems. He will skip a lot of the calculation"
4113,1405531,1.0,5.0,"people from the beginning of the class to roughy only 30 people remained. I also have other friends who read the ratemyprofessor's comments here before the semester began, and then changed a professor immediately. Now they all have an A. I wish I had done so. I heard from the class that there were less than 5 people are known to have Bs We don't"
4114,1405531,1.0,5.0,"Choose professors who are also skilled for this course but will not deliberately be too tough and harsh to unwritten rule, so called : &quot;university filter&quot;. I chose him as my fluid teacher together with other friends I know. The truth is, we have failed, and the average score in class was only 48 points. After the midterm, we went from more than 90"
4115,1405531,1.0,5.0,"Thiss gonna be a very useful suggestion: If you want to really study in this field, for example, if you want to become a college professor in the future, take him. If you are not required to apply a lot of fluid mechanics high level knowledge in your future career, then don't take him."
4116,1405531,1.0,5.0,Class average for the first test was a 47. Dude gives almost no partial credit and told us if we got a 35 or above hes not worried about us. He talks down to students who both dont ask questions and ask questions.
4117,1405531,1.0,5.0,He is condescending towards his students and accuses people of cheating if the method they used was not his own. Wahidi responds to emails very late and is unwilling to work with students.
4118,1405531,1.0,5.0,Terrible teacher accuses people of cheating even because method used to get answer was not what he taught.
4119,1405531,1.0,5.0,Dr. Wahidi expects things of you as a student that he does not vocalize and then penalizes you for not knowing that he expected it. He also has a very condescending tone and is not helpful when you visit him within office hours. Our test averages were constantly at a 50% and he would blame the students instead of trying to help.
4120,1405531,1.0,5.0,This professor is absolutely horrible.  I have him for statics at Bama and he is by far the worst instructor I have had.  He works problems in class which take him 45 minutes to work and then expects you to be able to solve them using his methods exactly in 5 minutes.  DO NOT TAKE HIM IF AT ALL POSSIBLE
4121,1405531,1.5,5.0,I had him for statics at Bama. He is extremely hard. His tests are ridiculous and I honestly feel like he wants as much people to fail as possible. His curve is way below the other static's class as well. I highly suggest taking someone else if available.
4122,1372779,1.0,5.0,Please avoid Dr. Olson at all costs. He made my first semester of college a miserable experience. Dr. Olson is condescending and overall rude. I was barely able to work on assignments for my other three classes due to the enormous work load. English Comp 1 was incredibly hard on my mental and even physical health. 
4123,1372779,1.0,5.0,Professor Olson’s class was the hardest class I have ever taken. His grading is very inconsistent. You never know what to expect. There was 3 assignments a week that require a ton of reading and then 4-5 paragraph essays due. The assignments took 12-15 hours to complete a week. I do NOT recommend this class Avoid at all costs. 
4124,1372779,1.0,5.0,Dr. Olson expects entirely too much from his students. He expects each student to spend around 12-14 hours a week on readings and papers. We had 3 papers to do a week and did not have one week off. Even on 2 day holiday weeks we were still assigned all 3 weekly assignments. Avoid this professor at all costs. Worst professor Ive had at MSU.
4125,1372779,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Olson comes off as if EVERYONE taking the class has a doctorate in literature. Sure, I enjoy writing papers, but Olson was just too much! If he doesn't like your opinion, he suggests not to give opinions in your papers, but then GIVES HIS OWN as if they are Gospel. Also, made us read House Seven Gables and Thoreau, most boring as* books ever!"
4126,1372779,3.0,5.0,Professor Olson is difficult but very concise on what he grades. He does give feedback on every assignment and gives tips on improvement. Prompt grader and lenient. He extends assignments if need be.
4127,1372779,1.0,5.0,The worse teacher I've ever had in all my years of school! Avoid him like coronavirus. This guy is the worse. His assignments are long and drawn out and everything you have to read is 20 pages. Then he wants you to right another 20 and that's just 1/3 daily assignments. His work takes about 15 hours a week to complete. DON'T TAKE HIS COURSES!
4128,1372779,2.0,5.0,"This professor is an extremely tough grader. Expect to read A LOT, almost every assignment requires you to read an essay and coordinating paragraphs on writing. He has several due dates throughout the week, ie. weekly assignments appear Sunday, the first is due Tuesday. His critiques on assignments come off as rude, condescending, and pretentious."
4129,1372779,1.0,5.0,"This is the hardest class I have ever taken. Whoever said English Comp II was a joke never took him as the professor. He gives daily assignments that take almost 5 hours a day to complete. Then grades them hard, like we have a PhD in writing papers. I would avoid this guy at all cost."
4130,1372779,1.0,5.0,"You could do everything right and still not get a 100. SO much reading. Minimum 1200 words for DAILY assignments and again you will not make a 100. Not an easy professor, would not take again."
4131,1372779,2.0,4.0,"I spend 15 hours a more a week doing homework for this class. Dr. Olson's class requires more time and work than all of my other classes (12hrs) combined. He spreads out mandatory due dates throught the week. A typical week consists of a projects (Journal, Discussion w/ 2 replies, Report, + 1 addtl assignment) due on Tues, Thurs, Sat, and Sun."
4132,1372779,1.0,4.0,"Just straight out horrible, he doesnt answer your emails correctly or will take forever to answer that its pointless. However, when he does answer it will literally be short and it doesnt pertain to your previous email. The class is a lot of work. Assignment are due tues,Thurs&amp;friday and will take about 2-3 hours to complete. Hes a tough grader"
4133,1372779,1.0,5.0,"His grading is super inconsistent, I would usually spend about 3-4 hours a day on the assignments. Most of the things he asks students to do is pointless."
4134,1372779,2.5,4.0,"There is A LOT of work in this class. You will be using your textbook and reading a ton. The assignments can be a little unclear, but if you take the time to ask him to clarify or to help, he is more than happy to do so. His grading is a little inconsistent and I never knew what to expect, but overall, it wasn't too terrible of a class. "
4135,1372779,1.0,4.0,Horrible professor. I'm an English major and all I wanted to do was to change my major after taking his class. Avoid at all costs.
4136,1372779,1.0,3.0,I hated this class. Hated. Inconsistent grading and so many assignments. He seems to think he knows everything and is very opinionated (and not afraid to say his opinions). DO NOT take his class if you can help it.
4137,1372779,1.0,4.0,Rambles off topic about things that are not related to English. Never stops talking. Condescending about everything. Never heard a positive word from this professor. Inconsistent grading. Think he is intellectually superior to anyone and everyone. Do not take this class.
4138,1372779,4.5,2.0,Mr. Olson is a nice guy and is always willing to help.He does talk for very long periods of time so his class can be very boring at times. He is very philosophical about things. You do have quite a bit of writing exercises but overall it is a pretty easy class.
4139,1372779,4.5,1.0,fun & easy class! you need to purchase the textbook because that is where all of your case studies come from but they arent hard and you go over all of them in class. class is super easy! definitely take him if you get the chance!
4140,438894,5.0,5.0,"It's not so much that he was a hard teacher--he just expects so much of people around him.  He's the greatest encourager I've ever known.  He could see greatness in me before I had a clue of that, myself.  He didn't use textbooks so much; rather, he made it possible for us to meet and know the authors of the leading texts.  That's much better!"
4141,438894,5.0,3.0,I had Mr. Anderson in 1987.  He was a great teacher.  Very understandable and had a sense of humor.  He knows what he is talking about.
4142,438894,5.0,1.0,He is the #1 professor I have had in my LIFE! I have my Masters & more than half of my PhD done so that is saying a lot! He has such a big heart. He will make you critically think & make you EARN your knowledge! MSU is stupid to lose such an AWESOME Prof!
4143,2634352,5.0,3.0,Phil is one of the best teachers I've had. His class feels like I'm the main character in a movie who is attending class. He always makes you think past what you learn and his lectures are very engaging and interesting. I love Gen Psych and Newlin is an AMAZING choice if you are looking to take the class. I genuinely look forward to class with him!
4144,2634352,5.0,2.0,"Professor Newlin is good at his job. He explains the material very well and in ways that are easy to understand. Not only is his class easy, but you actually learn a lot. If youll reach out to him, hell work with you. Highly recommend!!"
4145,2634352,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors Ive had at state!! He makes every lecture so lively and really goes into detail about psychology!! If you have to take gen psych TAKE NEWLIN!!!
4146,438900,1.0,4.0,"Never take this class, worse professor at MSU."
4147,438900,1.0,4.0,"She is a pretty good teacher, but she assigns too many assignments and too many tests. You must read every page in the book in order to do well in her class. She does not have realistic expectations of her students. She forgets that we have lives, jobs, and other classes besides hers."
4148,438900,4.0,4.0,Very challenging class. It went very fast and was very intense. Do yourself a favor and take the class in the spring. It is not meant for a 5 week summer class. Dr. Morse was very humorous and was helpful more often than not. I think she is probably great in a regular semester.
4149,438900,1.5,5.0,"Dr. Morse was one of the worst professors I had! She was demotivating, rushed through material and actually lied to students in front of me. She did not admit when she was wrong & I had to prove it to her. She demand way too much & was demotivating."
4150,1839747,1.0,5.0,She is not a good teacher. Did not enjoy it.
4151,1839747,1.5,4.0,"DO NOT take her class! In class, she reads the book to you(in the form of a PowerPoint) and still makes you attend. She likes to add her own opinion into the lesson as well. The worst part about it is you learn little to nothing. Don't waste your money on her class. If you have to take something she teaches, fine a different teacher."
4152,2536068,1.0,5.0,TLDR she made me switched majors. Made my second semester insufferable. Save your time and great effort for a good professor. Please
4153,2536068,1.0,5.0,"I had her for my very first art class as a freshman and I dont think Ive ever been more miserable in a class. She doesnt let you talk or listen to music as you see in class working on your art for 3 hours. During critique, she will give the smallest suggestions but then compliment the rest, and then fail your assignment. She is not very helpful."
4154,2536068,1.0,4.0,"To put it plain, shes not a good teacher. Shes a good at art for sure, but isnt able to properly teach students that have different learning methods. She pushes ideas onto you and gets very picky about the way you do things, things the final artwork wouldnt show (such as how your layers are organized). Just focus on being happy with your work."
4155,2536068,1.0,5.0,Do not take this class unless you want to feel self-conscious about everything you do. She grades based on her opinions whether your work is great or not. I wanted to cry every time I had to go to this class. She is so rude and does not take your feelings into consideration. I am an ID major and I am not an artist. Her way or the highway.
4156,2536068,1.0,4.0,"This teacher made me want to drop out of my program. She grades horribly hard and counts off for personal opinions. If she doesn't like the style of art you chose, expect to be counted off even if you made a masterpiece. She doesn't critique,she nags and doesn't tell you how to improve only what you are doing wrong. Would never ever recommend her."
4157,2536068,1.0,5.0,I have never felt more self conscious than I did when i was in her class. I had just switched my major to ID and she made me anxious and I hated going to her class. I tried my absolute best. I had never done anything with art or design. She criticizes every tiny thing and its her way or no way. She doesnt care how much work you put in.
4158,2536068,3.0,4.0,"she gives very good feedback on assignments and makes her expectations pretty clear. She does have very high expectations but as long as you follow them, you shouldnt have a problem. She demonstrates everything for you in class and explains projects step by step. Overall I liked the projects, just expect to spend a lot of time on them!"
4159,2536068,1.0,5.0,"She is the worst teacher I have ever taken at this school. She thinks everything is funny, especially when she is being SO rude! She will dock your grade if its not up to her standards. She critiques down to the littlest detail and then fails you on your assignment based on HER opinion of &quot;good art&quot;Its either her way or the highway. don't take her"
4160,2536068,1.0,5.0,"I would not take this class. Like seriously. Unless you love spending 36 ours on only one of your 6 projects, then I would not take this class. The work level was way too much and too hard for a beginner level design class. While she is a fine person, her class is not fine. Other classes do way less projects with way less intensity."
4161,2536068,3.0,3.0,This is her 1st year teaching. She grades kind of hard. You will spend a lot of outside time on your work. She is horrible on replying to emails. She does give vocabulary quizzes which are easy. During critique you must participate to receive credit. You will always stay the full time she never lets out early but 1 time. She never misses.
4162,2536068,1.0,5.0,"This professor made my semester absolute hell. I would advise nobody to take her. I learned absolutely nothing in the class, and the only reason I did somewhat decent was because I had previously taken a graphic design class in high school. I spent 30-40 hours on each project and put a lot of effort into it, only to get a B."
4163,438920,5.0,5.0,Good prof

4169,2437775,3.0,5.0,"I enjoyed Dr. Blank, and felt that he cared about us, however the tests were extremely difficult, so be prepared to study a ton. He offers a good bit of extra credit at the end of the semester, as well. I think he is preparing students for the real world, and it can fall short on some. Do the homework and project and you will get at least a C. "
4170,2437775,1.0,5.0,Do not take him if any other professor is available!!! His lectures do not prepare you for what you need to do in his class. He also talks down to you if you ask any question. I suggest taking class in summer when he is not teaching it.
4171,2437775,1.0,1.0,"His reviews and homework does not prepare you for the exams. I never made a D before this class. He will answer questions, but his exams are the hardest I've ever taken"
4172,2437775,1.0,5.0,His lectures do NOT prepare you for the tests or homework! He is nice and will answer any questions. You'll have way too many questions to ask him though. The final was a little easier than the other exams. I have never made Ds until him. He will add points to tests and grades at the end of the semester. Email him when questions seem unfair.
4173,2437775,2.0,5.0,Get ready to be doing homework and studying for his extremely hard tests all the time. Don't take this class with any other hard classes either
4174,2437775,2.0,5.0,"Good guy but not the best teacher. He tries to make finance as interesting as he can. The class is difficult. Expect hours of studying. If you go to class and do the homework, you should at least come out of the class with a C."
4175,2372246,5.0,2.0,He is a great teacher and wants to see everyone do good! He makes class fun and knows what he's talking about. You don't have to worry about his test that much as long as you come to class and do the coloring sheets you will have a good grade.
4176,2372246,5.0,4.0,I don't know why he has such a low rating on here. He is such a nice guy and hilarious too. He doesn't understand technology but he is very knowledgeable and you can access him easily during his office hours. He always gives extra credit coloring sheets that really help. It's a tough class but worth it to take with him.
4177,2372246,3.0,4.0,"Lamberth is very smart and really cares about the future of his students, but he's not good with technology which makes his class difficult. It's hard to figure out what information will be on the test &amp; his test dates aren't clear. Not a super hard class bc you can use your notes, but its stressful trying to figure out what is being asked of you."
4178,2372246,1.0,2.0,"Grading criteria very unclear. Questions on tests don't even make sense, and the only grades are tests and coloring sheets. If you ask for a clear study guide other than notes from his rambling lectures, he will say &quot;don't worry, I bump your grade at the end of the semester.&quot;"
4179,2372246,1.0,2.0,"Easy material and should be an easy A class, however he is very ditzy and doesn't know what he's doing. He puts stuff on the test that he didn't lecture about. He knows that everybody fails his tests, because the questions and answers don't even make sense, yet he doesn't think that it's his fault that people do bad."
4180,2437785,5.0,3.0,Great professor. You definitely have to study but it is not terrible. The group project at the end of the semester brings up your grade! If you go to class that will also help your grade a lot. It brought my score up 3 points alone. 
4181,2437785,1.0,4.0,Hate her she does not care about you. She will straight up lie and tell you do not worry about taking notes then make you take a quiz before she posts the slides. Those are pop quizzes btw. She posts the slides after she is done talking about them. What sense does that make? NONE This is an elective for finance majors so take a different class.
4182,2486946,5.0,4.0,"The class was tough, but Moss is an excellent professor. He is really nice, and always happy to answer questions. There's an assignment to do before each class, but he grades them easy. Those assignments are really helpful study tools. Tests always have curves of at least 5 points."
4183,2486946,5.0,4.0,"He is caring and really wants you to learn. He encourages questions, but it is also one of the toughest classes. I advise people to take a computer programming class because it really helps with his assignments and definitely read the textbook because the material is heavy. His tests are short answer, so you really need to know your stuff."
4184,2486946,4.0,4.0,"This class was very challenging for me, don't expect to just show up to lectures and be able to pass. You will need the book to complete the prep guides every week. The quizzes have some test questions on them so study those."
4185,1184426,2.0,4.0,"While Dr. Potter may seem cold, he actually does care about his students and wants them to learn. His lectures focus mainly on discussion, but in this class he didn't give enough time to answer his questions. He expects answers to his questions, before even discussing the material in class."
4186,1184426,5.0,4.0,Dr. Potter is a great professor. You will learn German in his classroom. The expectation for you is high. He is caring and invested with his students. He is completely 100 % fair with his students.
4187,1184426,1.0,4.0,Worst professor!!!!!! No wonder he got in trouble with the department head a couple of semesters ago. He was horrible. Will never ever take him again.
4188,1184426,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Potter is the worst professor. I've noticed most complaints are that he's too hard, but I didn't think so. He is so distant it's like speaking to a wall of ice. He has absolutely no sympathy for students, and his behavior towards some, mostly students of color or low income students, is disgusting. I wish I could report him to someone."
4189,1184426,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Potter normally teaches only teaches upper levels, and he teaches my German II class like we're more advanced than we are. When we ask what he's talking about because we don't know any of the words he's using, he keeps repeating himself in German. He's super rude to the only people of color in the class, and one actually dropped due to that."
4190,1184426,1.0,5.0,"Dr Potter normally only teaches German IV and above, and it doesnt seem like he knows how to speak at a lower level. Literally no one in my class understands what hes saying, and if we ask what something means he either repeats it in German OR begins to describe similar things in GERMAN. He never uses PowerPoint even tho it would make things easy"
4191,1184426,1.0,4.0,"This professor assigns so much homework and readings, it's hard to complete half of it if you're in any other classes. Also shows no sympathy with grading."
4192,1184426,3.5,4.0,"Alright, to be honest, Dr. Potter would do anything to help one of his students. I know its hard to get the courage to ask a foreign language professor for help because they're definitely going to speak the language with you, even though you're clearly having trouble. He is extremely patient and has a sense of humor. Smart guy, would recommend."
4193,1184426,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Potter is an incredibly intelligent man. He is very mild mannered and is easy to work with.  The material in a lot of his classes is difficult but he's pretty good about setting a workable pace with the material, whether German is your forte or not. If you're serious about German, I'd recommend taking at least one class from him."
4194,2347706,1.0,4.0,I took this class during the summer online and I wish I would have at least taking it in class. She is a tough grader and has no sympathy for any excuses whatsoever. I thought I did an assignment correctly but she sent it back and barely gave me any credit for my mess up. Her instructions are very vague on assignments as well.
4195,2347706,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Musser is the only professor I've had so far that legitimately intimidated me. She was strict and only smiled maybe once every class period. However, I appreciated that she only made us write 3 papers for the entire semester. A lot of our grade came from participating in the group discussions we had almost every class period."
4196,2372288,1.0,5.0,Worst prof ever. You have to listen to a 2 hour long video per chapter and do homework that is long and doesn't reflect the test or class videos at all. He does nothing to prepare you for the 12 step word problems (no multiple choice) that are on the test. He had to curve everyone's total grade by 10% points because everyone failed. DONT TAKE HIM!
4197,2372288,2.0,5.0,"Not very helpful outside of class. Material in class doesn't reflect the text. Videos in course are not up to par with other courses in the program. Be prepared, his class is unavoidable."
4198,2372288,2.0,4.0,"Only a midterm and a final for tests 50% of your grade which are graded RIDICULOUSLY hard, 1 quiz a week for 25% of your grade, 1 project for 25% of your grade (easy grading). Don't expect to make a B on one of your tests and end up with an A in the class. Get ready if you are taking this class."
4199,2831044,1.0,5.0,"Nice guy, but the stuff he did was outrageous. I dont think I have had a worse teacher in my life."
4200,2716362,3.0,3.0,"Mr. Crowson tried his hardest and was a super chill guy who cared about his students. However, he often would go off on tangents or let ungraded assignments pile up. The tests often were somewhat broken and could differ heavily from the material covered in lecture. Make sure to do and read through Zybooks as it is the best way to learn the material"
4201,2716362,4.0,2.0,"Took him for intro and enjoyed it. Lectures did tend to get on a tangent (although still programming related) so make sure you also read the book. Not the best at communicating, but a super chill guy who does care and want you to succeed"
4202,2716362,3.0,3.0,"Professor Crowson tries his best and I respect him for that. This does not stop his courses from occasionally become quite discombobulated. Quite often things will not be graded in a timely manner and tests will not be properly written in due time before their assigned date. However, he does offer plenty of extra credit if you opt to go to class."
4203,2716362,4.0,4.0,"Overall he's a good professor, he gave credit to the people actually trying to do well in his class. Though class is optional I discourage missing class because he gave extra credit often to the few people who would show up to class. A cheat sheet was allowed on every test including the final, Don't cheat in this class he will catch you"
4204,2716362,4.0,2.0,"Not a hard class if you did alright in Intro. His lectures are all over the place, so you're basically just teaching yourself the material with Zybooks. Tests are nitpicky and can wreck your grade, but he'll tell you everything that's on them so it's not hard to study. Overall a fairly decent professor, but most of his class felt very independent."
4205,2716362,1.0,4.0,"He started writing one of the tests the afternoon before the test, so it was full of errors and impossible to understand. It's been almost two weeks since we took that test, and he still hasn't finished grading it. So far, the average on that test is a 39. He also doesn't even know what labs he assigns, which makes it hard for him to help. "
4206,2716362,3.0,2.0,"I would say this teacher is your average computer science teacher. They offer help but you really end up learning how to code yourself. He has a good amount of homework, but his tests aren't difficult. His lectures are a little boring, but what can you expect. To sum it up... decent class."
4207,2716362,1.0,4.0,He doesnt teach very well. And for a beginner class he treats it like we already know the material enough to not have similar codes between other students. He doesnt often respond to emails in a timely manner and if he does he is very vague.
4208,2716362,1.0,1.0,"I agreed with most of the reviews here for the majority of the semester. The class is easy to pass, however, as a professor, Crowson is not great. Hardly teaches book and test material during lecture. Will also wait to report you for cheating during finals week if you have similar code to someone else on a previous assignment. Very unreasonable."
4209,2716362,4.0,2.0,"Mr. Crowson is overall a good teacher. He is super nice and really cares about his students, and is available outside of class if you need help with homework or labs. His lectures do get boring at times because they comes straight from the online textbook and homework, so you learn everything twice. Labs can be challenging but tests aren't too bad."
4210,2716362,4.0,2.0,"Chill dude, lectures can get seem like they devolve into unrelated (but still programming) topics. You'll mainly be teaching yourself through the online textbook though. Optional final exam with a drop grade."
4211,2716362,5.0,2.0,"Sometimes it seems like his lectures aren't related to the coursework, but if you pay attention it can teach you some tips and tricks that the textbook won't. All of the homework and labs have unlimited attempts, and the final exam is optional but can replace your lowest exam grade. Not a hard class, but the labs can be tough, so start them early."
4212,2716362,4.0,2.0,"He is a pretty solid intro professor. He doesn't just show slides or pointlessly explain new concepts, but actually codes things out and shows real world uses of said concepts. Labs were somewhat challenging, but interesting. He does seem slightly disorganized at times, but I would still recommend him for an intro class."
4213,2716362,4.0,3.0,"Obviously knows his stuff, but sometimes its as if he doesn't exactly know how to communicate that to Intro students. Lectures can be very informational, but some of the labs are seemingly completely unrelated. A solid choice for intro, just be ready to learn about turtles. :)"
4214,2716362,5.0,3.0,"Good intro class to programming. Lectures are great and easily understood. The labs are fun and challenging, but not impossible. He is super helpful with any questions you have. I recommend taking him if you get the chance."
4215,2683595,5.0,4.0,Easily one of the best professors on this campus. Highly recommend taking any of his courses. Very easy to get in contact with if you are having any issue with the coursework.
4216,2683595,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Kang is one of if not the best professor on campus. I had him for two classes and he is always so clear about assignments and grading. He doesnt take attendance and he records the lectures for those who miss class. He is very caring of the students success in and out of school. He offers help to improve resumes, job applications, and essays."
4217,2683595,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Kang is an incredible professor. I took him for my senior seminar and can truly say I've learned more this one semester from him (as far as real-life skills are focused), than most of my college career."
4218,2536141,5.0,3.0,Great Professor!
4219,2536141,5.0,2.0,"A lot of lectures, so it's kind of repetitive, but the class is super easy. He's kinda quirky, so the lectures themselves are interesting. I really enjoyed the class personally. Tests are pretty easy. He's super nice and an interesting guy, I'd really rec taking him."
4220,2536141,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed his class. It's not a difficult class by any means. He's funny and he tries to make the lectures interesting. The tests aren't hard as long as you study the lecture notes/slides. Other than tests, he has weekly quizzes and film quizzes. If you need and/or want to take Intro to Anthropology, I definitely recommend Dr. Lambert!"
4221,2536141,5.0,4.0,great professor!! fun class easy tests. if you listen you will do fine
4222,2536141,4.0,2.0,"okay first of all, this is a good looking man. homeboy wore green converse to class. class was pretty easy and interesting; however, lots of reading outside of class was required. easy A"
4223,2536157,4.0,4.0,"He offered help sessions on Monday nights and was eager to help. chem just isnt my strong suit so if youre similar definitely try to attend those and go to SI(textbook online for free, posted hand written notes online as he went)Hes very nice & easy to talk to imo so ask questions! He offered extra cred for answering questions during class"
4224,2536157,4.0,2.0,Provides plenty of examples and instructions on how to do them. Gives up to 5 points of test credit for getting in-class problems correct so make sure to go to class. Is very helpful for any homework questions.
4225,2536157,5.0,4.0,"Just go to class and ask questions. Dr. Creutz is very approachable and he makes time for his students. Tests are hard, but he goes over the material a lot and in good detail. "
4226,2536157,4.0,4.0,"This class is difficult and moves fast, but Mr. Creutz was pretty good at explaining the material. Attendance isn't mandatory, but you definitely need to go to class. He also held extra office hours one night a week for homework help. Overall, he's definitely one of the better choices for chem I."
4227,2536157,3.0,4.0,lots of homework. It's a difficult class but he does a good job teaching it. expects you to read ahead and know a little bit about the material before class. tests are hard. 
4228,2536157,3.0,4.0,"this is just a hard class. sid is a good professor, goes really fast. would recommend going to class, but not mandatory. he does use vevox to answer questions and ""take attendance"" but it gives you extra credit on the tests. "
4229,2536157,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Creutz is an excellent professor. Like any Chemistry 1 course this course is challenging, but Dr. Creutz really tries to help in any way he can. He responds to emails quickly and even had an extra help session for homework outside of recitation. There's a lot of work and it is a hard course, but Dr. Creutz really tries to help you."
4230,2536157,4.0,5.0,"I recommend taking chemistry at any other college. Dr. Creutz was a good teacher, but the curriculum was absurd. Expect hours of homework each week doing nothing but copying examples straight from the textbook and then doing 20 more problems. Also, be prepared for difficult tests."
4231,2536157,4.0,4.0,"I give him a 4/5 not because he is amazing, but because he is a good choice for the options available in the chemistry department. He speaks extremely fast in lectures. There is lots of hw, but no more than any other prof gives in Chem I. There are two practice exams per test, which REALLY help. I would best describe him as solid."
4232,2536157,4.0,5.0,Provides multiple practice tests for each exam and those are great practice. Homework isnt too bad but he talks really fast. He posts the notes online before each lecture. Tests are tough but the practice tests help a lot.
4233,2536157,2.0,4.0,"I did not enjoy this Professor's class at all. He was teaching at a level way over our heads, and expected us to know it all. Plus, there was like over 250 students in the room, so one on one time with the teacher was impossible. He does grade fairly, but his test were no joke. I would definitely not take him again unless absolutely necessary."
4234,2536157,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely amazing class. As long as you pay attention during the lectures (You get +3% to your final grade if you miss only a couple) and do the reading you should have no problem. Great thorough lectures and just generally an incredibly nice guy. If you need to take general chemistry, take this class."
4235,2536157,5.0,4.0,"Chemistry is a very difficult subject, but Dr. Creutz made it as easy as possible. He talks fast, but his PowerPoints were very helpful. He also uploads extra practice problems and practice exams, which are very useful for review."
4236,2536157,1.0,5.0,"To put it simply, this class was awful. This was his first semester teaching, and it showed. He goes way too fast through PowerPoints, and the slides dont help when you look at them after class. Very nice guy, but really an awful teacher."
4237,2536157,4.0,3.0,"He uploads his powerpoints before class, and he gives extra practice tests and problems if you need them. No accent or anything, but I would sit in the front because sometimes it's hard to hear. It is chemistry, so be prepared to do some work outside of class."
4238,1766118,5.0,4.0,Everything you've heard about Sean is true. He is a god. Best organic professor. The material is extremely hard but he is so patient with us and I'm very thankful for that. 
4239,1766118,5.0,5.0,"Had Stokes for Organic II. He is the BEST organic professor out there. If you pay attention in class and study the material each day you will get an A. Organic chemistry is just a learning curve. It is not a class you study the weekend before. I recommend not getting the ""required"" textbook, but do buy the ACS study guide book!"
4240,1766118,5.0,3.0,Dr. Stokes is the best professor I have ever had. Organic is a very difficult subject but he makes it as easy as possible. His lectures are great and he gives lots of examples. He is very easy to contact and get help from. Best option for Organic by far! 
4241,1766118,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Stokes is the best organic teacher.  Organic is still so difficult, but he does good trying to get you prepared.  He cares and is a very nice teacher.  He is funny and helpful too.  I highly recommend him!"
4242,1766118,5.0,4.0,10/10 Would recommend
4243,1766118,5.0,2.0,"Best professor organic chemistry teacher I could have gotten! The class, in general, is difficult but his lectures are nicely paced and easy to follow. n"
4244,1766118,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Stokes made Organic Chemistry understandable. He will always answer a question, even if it is something he just said, and he is always nice about it. Cares about the students enough to review and overall knows the material so well that he can teach it at anybody's level. Does not leave you behind and does not treat students disrespectfully."
4245,1766118,5.0,4.0,"I love this man, and would do anything for him. The best chemistry teacher I have ever had, and I have taken so many chemistry classes. Don't take anyone else for Orgo."
4246,1766118,5.0,4.0,"Stokes is by far the best professor for Organic Chemistry. The material is hard, and you will have to work hard for a good grade. He wants his students to do well in his class, and there is an adjusted grading scale to help with that. Buy the ACS book for the final, and use the practice tests to study. You can pass the class, I promise."
4247,1766118,5.0,5.0,Great Teacher. Cares a lot for his students. Best option in entire Chemistry department by far.
4248,1766118,5.0,4.0,Best professor in MSU Chemistry department hands down. Made Organic 2 very easy to understand.
4249,1766118,5.0,4.0,Stokes is easily one of the best professors in the chemistry department. He makes his lectures easy to understand and gives lots of hints for what will be on the exams. This semester he gave lots of extra credit through chapter quizzes and a 25+ point extra credit assignment towards the final. He also lowered the grading scale at the end. BEST BET
4250,1766118,5.0,4.0,Dr. Stokes is literally the best professor in the entire chemistry department. He really cares about his students' success and truly wants them to learn and do well on the assignments. It is a difficult class so be prepared to work for your grade but overall he is very understanding and helpful. Cannot recommend him enough!
4251,1766118,5.0,4.0,"He answered all of the countless questions I emailed him. He uses tons of examples in his lectures. My biggest struggle wasn't understanding the material, but remembering the vast amount of it you are taught. Highly recommend; never made below a 90."
4252,1766118,5.0,3.0,Dr. Stokes is the hidden gem of the MSU chem department. He helped me and my friends even though we werent in his class. I truly would not have passed if it werent for him. Everyone that takes him loves him &amp; I cant recommend him enough. He does not make you feel stupid for asking a question &amp; he is encouraging &amp; hilarious. Truly the best.
4253,1766118,4.0,4.0,"Stokes's lectures are not the most interesting in the world, but he still does a great job at conveying very difficult information. He cares about the success of his students, and he will help you out where needed."
4254,1766118,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Stokes is the best professor I have had in the chemistry department, and I will be taking him again for Organic 2. Extremely knowledgeable, knows what to talk about in lecture to best prepare students, and gives many outside resources to use to study. Extremely friendly and understanding, and engages the class and gets the tough subject across."
4255,1766118,5.0,4.0,"This man is an angel. Organic is the hardest class I have had yet, but he is very passionate about the subject and makes it enjoyable to learn regardless of difficulty. Compared to other instructors for that class, he has been the most helpful. Can not recommend him enough!!"
4256,1766118,5.0,3.0,Dr. Stokes is honestly the BEST thing to happen to the MSU Chem department. He explains concepts really well and does not make you feel stupid for asking a question. He will go out of his way in his free time to help you and I think that says a lot about his character and how much he cares about students. 10/10 would recommend him to anyone.
4257,1766118,4.5,2.0,"Of course Chemistry is a difficult class, so rating the difficulty of the teacher is difficult, although with Dr. Stokes resources there is no reason to fail his class. You have a great chance of success in his class if you try. My friends and I pulled off an A with pretty consistent studying. Overall, great professor."
4258,2101990,5.0,4.0,"Professor Webster was a great professor. He cares about his students and takes the time to get to know everyone's names. He is always available to ask questions and willing to help. The quizzes once a week are based off of the lecture. Tests are pretty hard, but if you go to class and take notes you should fine. Be prepared to put in a lot of work."
4259,2101990,5.0,4.0,"BEST PROFESSOR EVER. He truly cares about his students and will do whatever he can to help. Study sessions before tests even till 1 AM before the ACS final. He bought pizza and donuts for the final and continually ask for reassurance that you understand, and if you do not, he slows down and explains more. Go to class and do your homework."
4260,2101990,3.5,5.0,He expects you to read the chapter BEFORE he goes over it in class. His idea is that he cannot teach you ALL of it so you must read ahead and he will answer any questions you have and try to make the information make sense. If you don't read ahead you will be way lost in lecture. Test are hard. HE WILL GO WAY OUT OF HIS WAY TO MEET AND HELP YOU.
4261,2101990,1.0,5.0,"Charles Webster is one of those professors that give you blank notes and expect you to write the note yourself as he speaks in high speed.  His notes are at best comical, with childish font and cartoons implying that you are little babies who like funny looking stuff, but his quizzes are always detailed.  Basically, you have to learn by yourself."
4262,2101990,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE!!! His lectures are very confusing, gives one example problem and expects you to know how to work it out. Powerpoints are given to you with only pics so you have to fill in all the sentences while you try to keep up with him. Constanltly says ""basic gen chem 1 knowledge"" except it's not. Very hard, get ready to teach yourself"
4263,168691,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Oppenheimer for Foundations of Higher Math. He's a quality teacher who cares a great deal about his students; he tries to give as many good grades as possible. He can make difficult topics understandable and provides very fair assignments. His grading is rough at times, but never unfair. He often goes on tangents, which is bad for some."
4264,168691,2.5,5.0," His handwriting is TERRIBLE, so it is sometimes difficult to take good notes. He uses different notation than the book. Tests were easy except each time there was an impossible theory question that had nothing to do with the other  material. Funny and approachable guy though. Ask him questions. You can shave a whole chapter off of the semester. "
4265,168691,3.5,5.0,He's very intelligent and he means well. He's nice and genuinely wants students to succeed in his class. But he is not very good at teaching. He doesn't explain things simply. I had to work very hard to receive good grades.
4266,168691,5.0,3.0,"I had fun & learned a lot. He explains difficult & complex topics  clearly & simply so almost anyone will understand.  He is fair.  To earn an &quot;A&quot;, do all the homework & learn the topics he says will be on the exam.  He is very approachable & helpful out of class.  He may not like students asking him for a lot of help the day before the exam."
4267,168691,2.0,5.0,he was very hard and didnt do a very good job of answering our questions. he often made the comment that he assumed we already knew what he was about to teach us because we had access to the book. his tests were also very hard and he did not prepare us very well for them...no study guides or questions about the test beforehand. i dont recommend him
4268,168691,4.0,4.0,"He's a great teacher. I didn't do so well in the class, but that was my fault. He's not the clearest teacher I've ever had, but he's very helpful if you ask questions. I'd definitely recommend him to someone. Make sure to do the work and study if you take him. If not you'll surely fail."
4269,168691,4.5,3.0,"Great professor, sometimes a little difficult to keep up with.  Overall I would recommend him for any class at the Diff Eq or higher level."
4270,168691,4.0,2.0,"Good teaching style, sloppy hand writing, funny guy though.  I would reccomend him for another course, Dif Eq was hard, but he was a good professor."
4271,168691,5.0,3.0,a funny guy
4272,2388732,2.0,5.0,"One of our classmates had a dream that Dr. Smith threw her off of a building. So if that tells you anything yeah. Shes super tough and kinda mean! Her class is quick and confusing, and her practice sets are hard just to be hard. Its hard to learn anything when all she does is quiz you on what she barely teaches. And I mean BARELY TEACHES"
4273,2388732,3.0,5.0,"Shes rough with her testing, and she contradicts herself often. She knows the material, but she cant teach it well. Would not recommend."
4274,2388732,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Smith is not a good teacher. She is too smart for her own good. She does not give second chances on tests and she does not give study guides. I do not want to take any of her classes ever again. Please save yourself, and take any other professor."
4275,2388732,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Smith is one of the best professor I've ever had. She knows how to teach material clearly, but her class is still challenging which is a good thing. You will have to read the textbook, but she covers any questions you might have in lecture. Her Linguistics course is one of my favorite classes in my college career."
4276,2388732,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Smith was an absolute gem! I loved her class, and she genuinely cares about her students. While parts of the material are difficult, she is very willing to work with you and answer questions. She wants you to be successful."
4277,2388732,4.0,4.0,"The course material is rather difficult, but she will work with you to help you better understand. I had no problem meeting with her outside of class, she and I worked together to find a time that would work for both of us. I am very appreciative, she took the time to help me find out where I was getting lost in the material. Very good teacher."
4278,2388732,3.0,4.0,"Professor Smith is a fairly new professor, but the woman knows her material. She has very high expectations for her students. She comes off as &quot;cold and unapproachable,&quot; but she's just very firm and doesn't show compassion. She's not really flexible with office hours and she doesn't slow down for any reason; but you'll quickly learn a lot in class"
4279,2740990,5.0,4.0,This is a tough course- but it is so worth it if you want to be a field biologist. You HAVE to keep up with the lab work and you have to know your latin or you wont pass the course. Stay on top of the lab and lecture work and study it a bit every night and you will survive! He always gives extra credit if you come to class- so don't miss lectures!
4280,1078015,1.0,5.0,"Hard to understand. Homework is hard! He only goes over problems in class that majority of people missed. For every try on the homework, he takes off points. Not unlimited tries. Tests are taken in a very short amount of time. I dont think Ive ever completely finished in time. Just overall... no bueno"
4281,1078015,3.0,4.0,"Anatoli is hard to understand and his lectures can be dull because of that. His homework is nearly impossible to solve on your own, I recommend using Chegg to complete it and then go back to study the process that it used. However, it is pretty easy to pass with a decent grade, he helps you out. Learn when to use certain equations, you'll be fine."
4282,1078015,1.0,5.0,Horrible class. There is hardly any partial credit on the tests. One of our class test averages was 23. Hard to understand his accent and writing.  Solutions manual or Chegg is needed to complete the homework. Attendance grade is given. There was a slight curve given on the final averages though.
4283,1078015,2.5,3.0,"Nice guy. Sometimes hard to understand. Covers material well, pretty easy tests. Fair teeacher"
4284,1078015,3.5,4.0,"fair grader. gives weekly quiz and weekly homework. solutions manual was helpful, not to copy homework but to LEARN how to work it because homework problems were on tests and quizzes."
4285,2642687,2.0,4.0,"Honestly, I think that professor Erck has good intentions. However, I do not really understand how she expects her students to succeed in her class when she does not have a canvas so there is no access to any of the information and power points gone over in the lecture class. This class is very difficult and would not recommend. 3 grades=3 papers."
4286,2642687,2.0,5.0,"Unless you like philosophy then take it, otherwise I would not take this class if I were you. None of the lectures or breakout rooms make a lick of sense. This semester us students only had to rely on 3 papers, no test, no canvas, no extra credit, nothing else. So, unless you are good at doing papers do not take this class. "
4287,2642687,3.0,2.0,"No actual business ethics, the whole class is learning about philosophers and their ideals. Only 4 grades which are 2 tests and 2 papers(or 1 paper and presentation), tests are long and worth A LOT of your grade but aren't bad if you study and not a hard grader on papers. Attendance not required but heavy lectures and doesn't post notes"
4288,2642687,5.0,2.0,"One of my favorite professors I have taken at this school, Professor Erck is a ball of joyful energy as soon as she walks into class. Her genuine passion for the material is reflected in her teaching style. Though there is a lot of reading (or sparknotesing) involved, you will not only learn the material but question your own philosophies."
4289,2642687,2.0,4.0,"Is not very accessible outside of class. Only 4 grades (2 tests 2 papers) and lectures by talking - no powerpoints unless many students beg for them. Very knowledgeable and makes you think, though!"
4290,2642687,3.0,3.0,"Honestly, her lectures weren't my favorite, but they weren't terrible. You definitely will get more out of the class by attending it and honestly with the notes she gives in class, the tests are very easy. You have to do 7 discussion posts by the end of the semester and then there are two debates that if you participate, she'll give extra credit"
4291,2388733,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely loved this class. He makes class fun &amp; interesting no matter how uninteresting the text may be. He is open to discussion in his classes, and he explains the material in a way that everyone can understand. Its plenty of reading, 3 tests and 3 papers, but he isnt a tough grader if you tried and read the material. Books were very cheap."
4292,2028285,1.0,5.0,"He does not teach. You just do a ton of homework, then in class he calls on people to answer the problems."
4293,2028285,1.0,5.0,This is a self taught accounting class. Anything he says in class might as well be foreign language because I never understood anything he said. He randomly calls on students. Tutoring is your best friend. Homework is due every class and almost always take more than an hour to complete.
4294,2028285,2.0,5.0,"He is not very clear with his lectures. He is too smart for his own good. When explaining the lectures, he expects you to understand everything he is talking about like it's common knowledge instead of really teaching you. Super friendly guy and will try to help you if you ask, but his help is a lot like his lectures... Very ineffective. "
4295,987915,1.0,4.0,She was very into the material. I ended up pulling a B in the class just because she gave a ton of free points. Online work was difficult and mandatory but the website worked half of the time. She was not a very good lecturer in my opinion but she was just confusing overall and all over the place.
4296,987915,4.5,2.0,I loved her class.  I took her for Economic & Social Issues.  She was a sweetheart.  Her family is amazing and she's very approachable.  She's very welcoming.  She even invites you into her home for additional help.  Her husband Cade is also amazing!
4297,987915,4.5,3.0,Very helpful. Encourages students to learn and do well.
4298,987915,2.5,1.0,"She is completely insane, and a runner/bicyclist."
4299,987915,5.0,3.0,"I enjoyed Dr. Campbell's class. If you keep up in your outline, you should be fine. You can fail the in-class exams and still pass the class because of the bonus opportunities Dr. Campbell offers."
4300,987915,2.0,2.0,No Comments
4301,750348,2.0,5.0,"Does not like to answer questions, and is reluctant to clarify any explanations she gives. Very difficult test and homework. Cal II was a full time job... even the second time I took her class. The saying was that she made quick business majors out of what would have been fine engineers. "
4302,750348,2.5,4.0,"She works through the problem at the speed of light and does not like to have to answer questions about the problem once it is worked.  She will help during her office hours, but there is a recitation that she expects you to attend before you go to her directly for help.  GIVES A LOT OF HOMEWORK."
4303,750348,1.0,5.0,I would not recommend her class for anyone. She is not a good teacher. 
4304,750348,2.0,5.0,"Hughes is the worst Math teacher I've ever had. She's discouraging from day one, and loves to take up class time by bragging about herself. She HATES cheaters, and takes out her anger on the class by making lots of mean spirited remarks. She gives lots of online homework and only gives you 5 tries, and it'll be due on School holidays and weekends."
4305,750348,1.5,4.0,Ms. Hughes is a nice lady but an awful teacher. She is also fond of telling you that you can't pursue whatever degree or career field you're interested in.
4306,750348,4.0,4.0,"Hughes is a hard teacher. She gives lots of homework... 2 were due every week when I had her, she also has true/false quizzes, which are really tricky. Her tests are really hard, and difficult to study for cause she gets them from the numerous homeworks and notes, related rates is an awful topic! spare yourself the stress and take an easier teacher"
4307,750348,1.5,3.0,"Awful teacher! Gets bothered by asking too many questions, and she doesn't take interest in students. Feels like students should already know all the information."
4308,750348,5.0,2.0,Awesome teacher!!!
4309,750348,5.0,3.0,Awesome teacher!!
4310,750348,5.0,2.0,No Comments
4311,750348,4.0,2.0,"good instructor, i came in the class knowing nothing about Cal and did just fine, buy the solutions manual and learn all the problems she goes over and you'll be fine"
4312,750348,4.5,3.0,Mrs. Lorriane Hughes is very helpful. Her class can be very easy if you do your BCA homework and the practice problems she assigns you. Now don't get me wrong the problems are not hard and I recommend that if you are not good in calculus BUY THE SOLUTIONS MANUAL!!!!!!! I PROMISE IT IS THE BEST INVESTMENT YOU CAN MAKE AT THIS TIME IN YOUR LIFE!!!
4313,2315023,5.0,2.0,"I LOVE Mrs. Mabry. I had her for Voice and Articulation and she was honestly the bright spot in my semester. Shes very caring and easy to learn from. I honestly think shes adorable, like a grandmother. Her tests are easy and she always gives good feedback on presentations. If you dont miss any days, she gives you a surprise at the end!"
4314,2495252,4.0,3.0,Online homework isnt the easiest. Gives all the questions to homework and tests in class. Gives partial credit on tests. Doesnt round grades.
4315,2536212,1.0,5.0,"Final grade is only made up of 2 tests, homework, and final. The homework was nothing but watching clutchprep videos which took up more time than the class itself. Exams were online (due to covid) and barely enough time was given to answer all the questions."
4316,2536212,1.0,5.0,"Tons of online homework that don't matter. She says half of the test questions come from the reading quizzes, but they don't. She always gives her tests during everyone else's test weeks. I ended with a 79.45. She rounds a 79.50 though... I worked super hard, and I just could not understand her lectures. She doesn't even show up on test days."
4317,2536212,2.0,3.0,Reads straight off the slides so the lectures were boring. The tests weren't that hard and she is nice. The class is just extremely boring
4318,2536212,3.0,4.0,"There are hundreds of slides per test and just a lot of information. The homework was a lot of math, but there is no math in the lecture or on the exams. Get old exam questions if you can."
4319,2741014,5.0,2.0,I love Dr Wells!! She is great about responding to emails and really helping outside of class. She really cares about her students and as long as you do the homework its an easy A
4320,2741014,4.0,1.0,"very easy class. a lot of busy work. lots of projects, no tests only quizzes. "
4321,2741014,2.0,1.0,"This class was super easy, but I did not enjoy Wells' lectures at all. Her and all of our guest lecturers were extremely political. For a class all about opinions, I wish I could've seen more opinions than just a Christian/ Conservative view. One guest lecturer literally used the bible as evidence in one of his lectures."
4322,815898,5.0,4.0,Most loving and caring teacher you'll ever have. Works hard to teach you. Awesome dude.
4323,815898,5.0,3.0,"I definitely recommend him. Very accessible outside of class and an easy grader in my opinion. He had a help session before almost every homework that was due, as well as help sessions before tests!"
4324,815898,5.0,3.0,"You learn a great deal, he gives opportunities to redeem yourself, and he is extremely helpful. You get help sessions, old exam practice tests, full homework solutions. He is understanding and awesome!"
4325,815898,5.0,4.0,"Gotta pay attention, but a really generous and good guy. Knows who works hard and rewards those who do."
4326,815898,5.0,4.0,"He sometimes has a bit of a teach from the slides style, but thats just because theres a ton of material to cover. When you look at the notes while doing the homework, youll find that theyre meticulously detailed and actually quite helpful just by themselves. He offers help sessions and is accessible far beyond what is required. 10/10"
4327,815898,4.5,3.0,He's the dean of the aerospace department. He teaches 8000 level courses. He definitely knows his stuff. Super helpful and can dumb it down to whatever level you're on. Tests were always easy problems. Always a pulley problem though.  
4328,815898,4.0,5.0,"Be sure to be ready to work hard in his class, but you sure will learn a lot."
4329,815898,4.0,4.0,No Comments
4330,2388771,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Gentry was an amazing instructor! He does a great job teaching and allowing the class to participate. There were a lot of essays and papers to write, but they are of reasonable length and were not super hard. There were a couple of pop quizzes but you could get away with missing a reading or two. He also had a good sense of humor."
4331,2388771,4.0,4.0,His class is very laid back. Make sure to read assignments before class as we talk about them in class. His 1 page paper assignments are required before the reading is due. It would be helpful to read in advance and ask any questions before you write. His 3 page paper assignments are a little more difficult.
4332,2388771,5.0,3.0,"Very wonderful teacher, connects with students easily and funny. He is amazing at explaining things and gives students plenty of opportunities to participate and ask questions. Explains assignments very well and is accessible outside of class if you have any extra questions. Grades and gives feedback within a few days of submitting work. Amazing."
4333,2388771,5.0,3.0,"10/10...... Whenever I emailed him, he always emailed me right back."
4334,2388771,5.0,4.0,Great Professor super nice and helpful.
4335,2388771,5.0,4.0,"Very funny man, makes you work hard for your grade. Make sure you show up to class or you won't pass!"
4336,1274677,5.0,5.0,Tims a great professorhe pushes hard but provides great feedback and really supported my class. He also has some fun stories! I learned a lot from his Design II class and felt very inspired to work hard and have fun with my art.
4337,1274677,3.0,4.0,"He gives good feedback for art projects. You have to show up to class in order to pass his class. Its not an easy A, but he does everything he can to push you to succeed. Don't take his criticism to heart, he is only trying to make you better as an artist."
4338,1274677,5.0,4.0,"Excellent teacher, very helpful and involved. He won't do any work for you, but he will push you until you succeed, and he'll be honest with your work, but it's all constructive. I highly recommend him to anyone doing design or painting concentrations, as those are his strongest suits."
4339,1291065,2.0,4.0,"This class is disorganized & clearly just a copy-and-paste rehashing of semesters past. She posts a bunch of PDFs with no real instructions about what to be doing with them or how to be pacing yourself. There were 8 assignments for the whole semester, including the midterm and final. She is available via text, but you really need to be proactive. "
4340,1291065,1.0,2.0,"Has the knowledge, but she didn't want to teach. Was more interested in discussing her personal matters in the class. She doesn't say anything about how she is going to test you. Don't post notes or grades. Never check emails. One of the worst experiences."
4341,553788,5.0,3.0,I took him for Poetry Since 1900 and you can tell that he loves what he does. Sometimes he does ramble but he genuinely cares about his students. He let me take a test early when I told him I would be out of town and he's super helpful about meeting during office hours.
4342,553788,4.0,2.0,"Very nice professor, passionate about literature and cares for his students. Gave me a detailed explanation when I asked about a grade I received on a paper and told me how to improve."
4343,553788,5.0,2.0,Dr. West was the best professor I had this semester. I felt as if I knew him even with the class being asynchronous. He is super understanding and cares deeply for his students' wellbeing during the pandemic. As long as you take notes over the lectures and do the reading you will be just fine. He responds to emails asap and helps a lot.
4344,553788,5.0,3.0,"I took this class online and he seems to really care about his students especially during the pandemic. When writing the first paper, my computer crashed and deleted my paper that was 3/4 of the way done. He was understanding and asked if I could turn it in the next day. I ended up finishing it the day it was due. There are discussions on readings."
4345,553788,5.0,3.0,"His lecture style was more lecturing and less discussion which is different than most English classes I've taken at State, but he was still really passionate and wanted the students to be so as well! It was an interesting class, and not one that I was particularly fond about the subject with, but he was helpful and explain things well."
4346,553788,3.0,3.0,"This professor is super boring, but it's not hard to pass his class. I recommend always coming to class, and be prepared for pop reading quizzes."
4347,553788,5.0,3.0,"Dr. West is VERY nice and was very helpful to me. I worked very hard for my A. He was always willing to meet with me about my papers and address my concerns. He really knows what he's talking about, and I think he really wants his students to learn. If you're not willing to work, don't take him. Otherwise, I'd recommend him!"
4348,553788,4.0,4.0,"Go to class everyday, be on time, take lots of notes, read every night, and study your ass off.  He'll make every effort to help, but will expect you to make every effort, as well.  You'll have to REALLY work to get a B, and you'll have to REALLY be dedicated to get an A.  A little boring, but a really nice guy who wants feedback from the class."
4349,553788,5.0,3.0,No Comments
4350,553788,4.5,2.0,"He's so nice and helpful, but he grades hard. If you're used to As expect Bs. We worked in small groups, which made writing papers much easier. If you want a challenging honors class, go for this one, but be prepared to work hard for a just a B!"
4351,553791,1.0,3.0,"She was super unorganized. I never knew what was going on. I basically taught myself. If you don't know the material already, you'll have trouble understanding and learning and you'll do bad on the tests. You can find all the quizzes on quizlet."
4352,553791,2.0,4.0,"Took her class during spring 2021. Never responded to messaging, often forgot what material we had already covered, and canvas page was a mess of misinformation. However, she was lenient with due dates and late work and would be helpful if you were cheery. If you aren't already familiar with the subject, find another professor."
4353,553791,1.0,4.0,"Every single day we went into the classroom she had a new assignment for us to do, which she never told us the day it was due. Often times she would just say &quot;Okay, pass your papers forward.&quot; You basically get a lot of assignments and go to your room to teach yourself. She also does not work well with technology, so you do not expect responses."
4354,553791,1.0,3.0,"Moody doesn't know how to work technology in the classroom, her mycourses page is unorganized, and she hardly ever tells you due dates and just says ""turn your worksheet in now"", her lectures are slow and hard to follow, doesn't show up to her office hours. You will be fine in this class if you have taken chemistry before, if not do not take her."
4355,553791,1.0,3.0,"I despise this woman. If you had chemistry in high school, you'll be fine. If you're like me and DIDN'T have chemistry in high school, beware. She's old, not helpful, gets confused a lot, and occasionally gives inaccurate information which I attribute to her age. Her lectures are long and disinteresting. SHE DOES TAKE LATE WORK THOUGH! "
4356,553791,1.0,1.0,No Comments
4357,553791,4.5,1.0,"This class is so easy. Just show up and take notes. There are some major projects, but they aren't graded hard at all. If you remember anything at all from high school chemistry, you will be just fine in this class."
4358,2724679,1.0,4.0,"John Poros is perhaps the wort professor I have had the opportunity to take since being at Mississippi State University. If you are preparing to take one of his classes, prepare for a unprofessional professor who is willing to help you little to none and only reads directly from a powerpoint. In one instance I was cussed out for no good reason."
4359,2167632,3.0,3.0,"Overall you learn a lot in the class. You do not have to go to class but at least scan in. For me, going to class helped because he gave hints on what was on the test. As long as you read over the chapters thoroughly you should do fine."
4360,2167632,2.0,3.0,"I currently take him for Individual & Family Nutrition and all he does is TALK! The class could be a lot shorter if he didn't go off topic. Aside from the lecture, he talks about his favorite foods, where they can be found, his meal for the day, and how he loves the taste of Olive Oil"
4361,1504085,1.0,2.0,"Dr. Smith is a nice lady, but this was a terrible class. She approaches a class of honors freshmen as if she were teaching a kindergarten class. Most of the class is spent making posters and taking personality questionnaires from the internet. On assignments, her expectations are unclear and her grading is arbitrary. Do not take unless you have to."
4362,1504085,1.5,2.0,"She's a lovely person, but I hated this course. It was not what I expected. It was very boring. I took it only for the Honors credit, and I honestly dreaded the class each Tuesday. I really recommend taking a different course. If you must take it, make sure you go to class and participate. It's really dull but also easy if you show up."
4363,1504085,1.5,2.0,"Worst class ever.  Literally just an economics class.  She never really seems to know what's going on, and I hate listening to her talk.  She's nice and seems smart but probably should not be teaching."
4364,1504085,1.0,3.0,"DO NOT take her unless you have to!!She is very unclear on what she wants from our paper and she grades them very hard plus she changes her mind all the time,very hard to keep up with whats due and when is it due.Quizes have 25+ questions!(more like tests to me)She is cool but not a good teacher AT ALL"
4365,1504085,1.0,3.0,"WORST teacher EVER!!Do not take her unless you have to!!She is very unclear on what she wants from our paper and she grades them very hard plus she changes her mind all the time,very hard to keep up with whats due and when is it due.Quizes have 25+ questions!(more like tests to me)She is very sweet and nice but not a good teacher AT ALL"
4366,1504085,2.5,2.0,"She is a very sweet teacher, but this is one of the worst classes I've taken. I hardly learned anything in class. You'll have to learn a lot on your own, from your book. Lots of online homework. Some test questions come from hw questions. For every test, you'll get 15 min. to use book. My class had to take every test at least twice. DON'T TAKE!"
4367,2560854,2.0,4.0,Ms. Raden overall is a decent professor. The only reason I didn't like her very much was because of how hard her tests are. She has essay questions and will fail you if you are caught plagiarizing so just be aware of that. I found her lectures to be boring but she does post her powerpoints so if you skip class you should be good.
4368,2560854,5.0,2.0,"I loved Ms. Raden! She was very understanding, especially amidst all the chaos surrounding school during a pandemic. She aims to help non-psychology students understand and enjoy the subject. Her tests were online but covered the material appropriately and were fair. If you're looking for an easy, yet interesting class, TAKE HERS!"
4369,2560854,5.0,3.0,"Shes great! You dont need a book b/c she posts short PDFs. Multiple attempts on quizzes that you can literally read the answers off PDFs. Come to class, b/c she does fun in class activities which give you a good grade boost. Read her PowerPoints, study the quizzes, and go to class. Its interesting stuff, and she makes it more fun!"
4370,2536280,5.0,1.0,"All the work for the class is done online. There is so much work for the class, but if you stay on top of it you'll be fine. Mrs. Hudson was awesome! If you have any problems, just email her. You can leave early every class as long as you're caught up on everything."
4371,2536280,5.0,1.0,She is a wonderful teacher. You do most of the assignments on your own time but she will let you use class time. You pretty much have to walk in and say here and you can leave. You can work ahead and do all the assignments way before due. There are around 70 assignments for the semester but you only have like four due a week. very easy A
4372,2437980,3.0,1.0,"All of the work is online, so no need to buy the textbook. She let us out several minutes early every time. I highly recommend for an easy A. She lectures using a powerpoint. Classwork and group work does not exist. A review is given before each test, including the final exam."
4373,2437980,4.0,1.0,"She just reads off of slides. It takes a few class periods to get used to her voice, but overall the class was super easy. I didn't use the textbook and all hw is online. She does test review the day before the test so MAKE SURE TO COME THAT DAY. She also lets out early almost every day, which is super nice."
4374,2437980,4.0,2.0,The lectures are boring but the information in the lectures is useful. The tests/quizzes are online. Show up because she will give you the answers to the test. Also be prepared to participate she loves class discussions. She truly wants you to pass and I would definitely take her class again.
4375,2306930,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Potter is overall a great professor. He strongly believes in the philosophy that learning is a choice. His lectures are interesting and his tests are online, taken at home, and open book. He doesn't take attendance regularly, but he does randomly do attendance quizzes. I will be taking him again for future political science classes."
4376,2790264,2.0,5.0,"The main thing is, If you don't do well on midterm, you may as well drop the class. His midterm tests is about 70% of your grade. It doesn't matter how well you do on assignments, those barely count for anything. There are about 2 maybe 3 things labeled midterm. Not a good instructor; although he knows the material well. Extra cred doesnt help much"
4377,2790264,3.0,3.0,"Very knowledgable but his accent makes things difficult. The tests are pretty close to together and are weighted very heavily. A ton of studying is required for this class and if you don't, you won't pass. He does offer a plethora of extra credit to recover points (the only reason I passed). Super sweet guy, wouldn't want him as a teacher again."
4378,2724744,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Krish, although he may not seem like it (especially at the beginning of the semester), really cares about his students and their success. My class in particular did not do well on the first exam, and he really put in the effort to help us in areas that we performed poorly. Protein methods is a difficult course- work hard and you will be fine."
4379,2339726,3.0,3.0,"There was nothing exceptional about him. He wasn't bad, but the lectures were mind numbingly boring. The tests and discussions were super easy, but the papers were graded ridiculously hard. This was his first year to do a group project, but he said he'll do it again. Hopefully, he'll do it better next time cause it was not fun this semester."
4380,2339726,3.0,3.0,Gives a lot of assignments but they aren't really weighed anything so they don't really help or hurt your grade. Gives weekly quizzes and discussions. Usually takes late work on discussions. He is a very very very hard grader when it comes to essays. The essay means everything to your grade. If you don't do well you are screwed.
4381,2339726,1.0,3.0,"Easy quizzes and weekly discussion board assignments. However extremely tough grader on Essays. You can write an amazing paper and I don't believe you would make over a 90. Lectures are dry and humorless, I often drifted off in thought because of how unengaging they were. Class attendance is graded and that is the only reason I showed up."
4382,2339726,5.0,4.0,"Class was definitely challenging, but I learned a lot about myself as a student. Dr. Chamberlain always seemed to genuinely care about how we were doing as students and would make an effort to ask us how we were doing before each class. He is a tough grader for papers, but gives great feedback to help you improve. Reading is a MUST in his class!"
4383,2339726,5.0,4.0,"I would take Dr. Chamberlain a million times over. He's a great professor who genuinely cares about his students. This class is tough, but he does a good job making it manageable and helping you understand difficult concepts. In my mind, he's more concerned about an enriching academic experience than anything. I'd recommend him to anyone."
4384,2339726,5.0,2.0,"This class was awesome, and Dr. Chamberlain is excellent. You will have some texts to read, and there are four tests and two papers on the readings. The tests/papers are a breeze as long as you do the readings and PAY ATTENTION TO HIS LECTURES! Dr. Chamberlain is brilliant and passionate, and he gives great feedback and is happy to help."
4385,2339726,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Chamberlain is a political theory maestro. He doesnt use textbooks, instead you get a few small books and read them. His class is easy, if you do the readings and want to learn. He grades papers for knowledge on the topics, not for grammar or MLA formatting. An all around good guy."
4386,627603,5.0,1.0,"Literally THE BEST professor at Mississippi State. He is super funny and truly cares for his students. Curves all of his tests and throws out questions the majority of students miss. No assignments other than a couple tests and a final. His class is strictly lecture, but he gives a study guide for every test. SERIOUSLY THE BEST TEACHER"
4387,627603,5.0,1.0,Friendly and a pleasure to follow in lecture.
4388,627603,5.0,2.0,Best professor at MSU despite what his fellow professors say about him.
4389,627603,5.0,1.0,He knows his stuff and is interested in your opinion. He encourages debate and respects everyones opinion. Gives you some great need to know facts. Very helpful.
4390,627603,5.0,1.0,Good ole' boy and very helpful
4391,2700195,3.0,5.0,"Mr. Ferguson was a nice and understanding person when I spoke to him. I struggled in accounting. I ended up passing it in the winter, but if you are looking for a teacher that gets to business but can be understanding this is a good teacher for you. Just communicate with him."
4392,2700195,4.0,4.0,"Intermediate 2 is a hard class no matter who teaches it. Dr. Ferguson was a pretty good teacher, but the lectures were extremely monotonous and boring. He does give study-guides which are really helpful when preparing for the test."
4393,2700195,3.0,4.0,"The exams are departmental so he didn't make the exams. Accounting in general is difficult, but he was pretty good. TONS of homework tho. But do it and do the chapter reviews before each exam and you should be okay. I heard that other ACC2013 profs didn't give the chapter reviews, so for that, take this guy. Nice enough too"
4394,2290596,5.0,2.0,Super nice guy who really cares about what he's talking about. He goes over what things you need to know before the tests and will answer questions about the material during the review.
4395,2290596,5.0,4.0,Really good teacher with a really good personality that makes lecture less painful to sit through. Tests are somewhat hard but youll make it.
4396,2290596,5.0,4.0,"He is a really awesome teacher. The more you pay attention, the better you will understand what is going on. His tests are somewhat difficult, but nothing that studying hard won't help. I really recommend him."
4397,2290596,4.0,4.0,"Harder than I expected, but it was interesting, at least. He's enthusiastic about the subject. He gave us study guides but they weren't all-inclusive. Tests are pretty hard but sometimes have extra credit. I didn't open the book once but if I missed a lecture I felt really behind. Labs were graded kind of hard."
4398,2290596,4.0,3.0,"This is a pre-req so I did not expect it to be as hard as it was. The lab was super easy, but the tests that we were given during lecture were not. For the first few tests, he gives study guides, but they do not include everything that is on the test. For the last tests, though, he does gives direct information that will be on the test."
4399,2700196,5.0,4.0,I absolutely love Dr. Davis. Hes only 27 so hes not far removed from where we are. We had 4 tests and 4 homework assignments. I took the Honors Section which came with a final paper but he broke it up into sections and gave us great feedback. Hes really good at explaining and I can wait to take him again.
4400,2479014,2.0,2.0,"She uses lots of outdated terminology. Also, she tends to make inappropriate comments and can make people feel uncomfortable. She is a good teacher and is very accessible outside the class I just can not get pass the inappropriate comments. "
4401,2479014,4.0,1.0,She is very accommodating and easy to communicate with. You can tell that she really cares about you as a student and wants you to do well. Very homework and quiz heavy but they're easy and she grades leniently. The  class I took was asynchronous but she was very interactive and tried to make it interesting and engaging for us.
4402,2479014,5.0,1.0,"took online for human growth and develop. was very easy but alot of assignments. one project during the semester, other than that its just easy quizzes and exam. she post powerpoints for everything and everything on powerpoint is on exam and quizzes."
4403,2479014,5.0,3.0,Gainer is passionate about what she does &amp; expects the same from you. There are quite a few assignments scattered about throughout the semester and 2 tests. Class is always interesting and she makes understanding the content as easy as she can. She can be a little kooky but it is always in the best way. She is probably the best professor I've had.
4404,2479014,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Gainer is an okay teacher. She has lots of homework and expects a lot from you. There are times when she will say something awkward or that might make you feel uncomfortable. she is the only one that teaches this class or evaluating learning, so thats why I marked that I would take her again. Shes not terrible. Be prepared to be called on."
4405,2479014,1.0,3.0,"Most education majors cant get around Gainers class but honestly if you can find a way to take it online, do it. She says inappropriate things almost every class and still uses outdated terms. I really think they should bring in a younger professor for this class."
4406,488355,3.0,3.0,Overall ok class. Lots of homework and graded speaking.
4407,488355,3.0,3.0,"Attendance is graded so you need to go every day. You will need the book, she uses it every day and you will need it to do homework. She expects you to speak Spanish every class period but that really happens a lot. Her accent might seem a little difficult to understand for some people. Tests don't align that well with what's taught."
4408,488355,4.0,3.0,"Professor Vozzo is so sweet and caring! She's Dominican and her accent is thick, so if that's going to be a problem, don't take her. I took her for Spanish 3 and I think she taught us very well. The only tests you'll take are the midterm and final."
4409,488355,4.0,1.0,"I had Mrs. Vozzo for First Year Seminar! It was a super super easy class that was one hour a week. If you need a GPA boost take this class. The lectures aren't very prepared, but she doesn't get paid extra for teaching the class. The school gives the class a budget, so we got free Starbucks."
4410,488355,4.0,3.0,"I enjoyed this instructor's class. She's very down-to-earth and knows her content well. She claimed that she'd teach the course mostly in Spanish, but didn't, which was a let-down for me. Do what's assigned and know your vocabulary and you're set to get an A."
4411,488355,4.0,4.0,"Rosa is so so sweet and refers to you as her family. However, her accent is super thick and she speaks very quickly, but she is still the best spanish prof I've had. Tests are hard and homework is excessive and she expects you to speak in every class period."
4412,488355,2.0,4.0,"All around this teacher is a hard grader &amp; her tests are very short, only one page. If you dont read the book for the class you will not pass, also write notes on what you have read. Ask classmates if you need additional help. She wants you to do good but has a weird way of showing that. She doesnt reply to emails really &amp; her English isnt great"
4413,488355,4.0,2.0,"Mrs. Vozzo's super fun and nice (she brought chocolate coffee beans to our 8 am test once) and really wants you to do well. If you put in the effort, she'll help you out. If you can make her remember you (for good reasons), you're set. Do the homework and try in class and you'll get a good grade. I can and will take her again."
4414,488355,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Rosa is THE BEST teacher I have had at Mississippi State University... Hands down! She is super nice and very funny. She is truly concerned about helping each student grow at their own pace and at their own level. If you have the opportunity to take one of her classes, do it! You will absolutely love her!!!"
4415,488355,4.5,1.0,Great teacher! For Spanish 3 she made the class interesting and overall it was very easy. She takes time to help you if you need it and she really cares about each of her students. The tests are very easy and she grades projects easy.
4416,488355,5.0,1.0,She's wonderful! Very funny and interested in you as a student. She's one of those professors you'll still talk to long after you've finished her class! Love her!
4417,488355,5.0,1.0,very sweet
4418,488355,4.0,2.0,"Not too hard of a class, but Senora Vozzo makes it interesting. She's a wonderful teacher and great person!"
4419,488355,4.5,4.0,No Comments
4420,488355,4.5,1.0,"Her English is hard to understand, but not too hard.  She really tries to help you understand."
4421,611245,4.0,3.0,"She is a decent lecturer, she moves quickly so you have to pay attention. There is 1 homework and 1 quiz due at the end of each week, 4 tests total. The tests are the majority of the grade, so always do the test reviews they are very similar to her tests. Her class made me good at coll. alg. but I would contribute that to the time I spent studying."
4422,611245,1.0,4.0, 
4423,611245,1.0,4.0,"She's a chill person but not a great professor. She rushes through lectures and doesn't clearly explain each problem. There are problems on exams that were not covered in class. The class itself is hard but with Walters, it's unnecessarily difficult. I retook the class with another professor and passed with a B. Avoid her if at all possible. "
4424,611245,4.0,5.0,"Ms. Walters is actually a great teacher. She can help you and explain anything you have to ask and she breaks down her explanation so good. It is just on the tests especially the final exam, there are gone be so many questions your not going to remember you went over. She also takes attendance seriously!! and she will report you if you scan/leave."
4425,611245,3.0,4.0,"She gives you her PowerPoint to print out and fill in, but she rushes through the material. You need to go to class but be aware all the questions on the homework and quizzes are not covered in class, so you have to teach yourself. The test reviews are helpful for the tests, but, again, not all the material on the test is covered in the review."
4426,611245,4.0,3.0,"Mrs. Walters is a pretty good teacher for business calculus. She's too enthusiastic for my taste, but she cares about you. You will have to go to the Math Domain for 10 quizzes that you can use notes for, and there are 4 exams. Just do the exam reviews she posts on MyLabs and you'll be fine. Pretty much, just do your work, and you'll be fine."
4427,611245,5.0,4.0,"Sweet, lovely lady. I took her synchronous online, so she'd teach a live lecture and also uploaded a second video lecture. So she taught each section twice, which is very helpful in BCal. If you had to miss a lecture, you're given the materials necessary to be successful. She's happy to answer questions and made sure everyone's on the same page."
4428,611245,5.0,1.0,"As much as I hated the class I took with her, Mrs. Walters was one of my favorite professors. She is so kind, and really makes sure you understand the material. I had a smaller class, so she also made sure she had a relationship with all of us and made us feel welcome in her class. She was really great and I recommend her."
4429,611245,1.0,4.0,I wouldn't recommend anyone take her for business calculus. There's no TA so that sucks. She teaches extremely fast and teaches in a way I can't comprehend. I'm going to have to retake this class. I recommend taking someone else that is easy to learn from. Also she probably used to upload notes but not anymore so if you miss a class you're screwed.
4430,611245,5.0,3.0,"She made college algebra feel easy. She made sure that she was clear and easy to understand when she was teaching us. The way she structured her class made it really easy to learn. She was generous and accommodating and allowed quite a few drop grades. There was a lot of homework and a quiz due every week, but she always gave us plenty of time."
4431,611245,4.0,4.0,Shes an awesome teacher and explains everything well. If you dont pay attention to her lectures you wont do well. Shes not the best at answering emails
4432,611245,3.0,4.0,"We had quizzes and homework every week. I struggled in this class, but probably because it wasnt in person. You have to pay attention and do the work to do good."
4433,611245,5.0,1.0,Definitely take her class! Yes there's a lot of homework and her lectures are definitely mandatory. But she's a real sweetheart and she made this class SO easy. And yes she will keep you the entire 50mins. But if you do your work you'll get an A and she doesn't mind helping you.
4434,611245,5.0,4.0,"One of the best math teachers I have ever had! Math does not come easily to me, but she made it easy to understand and conveyed the material very well. She truly cares about her students. The homework load is heavy, but doing it really helps on the quizzes/tests. I highly recommend this class."
4435,611245,5.0,4.0,im not a math person at ALL but she made the class so fun and somehow made math easy for me. going to class is CRUCIAL. she has a wonderful personality. i wish she taught subjects other than math so i could take her again lol. tests are not hard IF you know the homework &amp; study.
4436,611245,5.0,2.0,A great professor! She breaks down the math problems very well and she is always interacting with students. Shes very nice and is always willing to answer any questions. Do the homework and go to math lab and you should be able to get a A in her class.
4437,611245,4.0,3.0,She is one of the best math teachers I have had because I actually understood calculus after taking this class with her!
4438,611245,1.0,4.0,"Wouldnt advise this professor to anyone breathing. She gives ridiculous amounts of homework, and test have almost nothing to do with class materials. If you have a pulse, PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS LADY!"
4439,611245,4.0,4.0,Good Teacher
4440,611245,5.0,3.0,One of my favorite professors I have had so far. She is very sweet and is willing to help you out if you need help. She gives a lot of notes so definitely go to class.
4441,611245,3.0,4.0,"She is a nice lady but can get off topic sometimes. Her class is tough but if you study a little bit everyday and dont miss the labs, you can get an A. Print out your notes online before class so you just have to fill in the blanks and can listen better and not have to write so much down."
4442,611245,3.0,4.0,"Attendance is mandatory. Even though she does post the lectures online, you will still be completely lost if you dont come to class. The amount of homework every week is ridiculous and the tests are graded very hard!"
4443,611245,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Kim is the best college algebra teacher at Mississippi State. She really cares about her students and she is passionate about what she teaches. Go to class, print the notes, and do the work and you should do great in her class!"
4444,611245,3.0,3.0,"I love Kim , but math made me very sad this year. It was very hard and I was not focus til the end of the semester cause I was trying to get my grade up. I blame all the trouble on myself but Kim does teach very fast you look at your phone or anything and BOOM you basically lost, she adds the notes online though, I believe going to her office help!"
4445,611245,4.0,4.0,"Good teacher, but dont expect her to respond to emails if you have a question. Also you better show up to class AND lab every single day if you want to pass. The only thing is the RIDICULOUS amount of homework every single week along with a quiz and maybe even a test. Very unnecessary, but helps you learn I guess."
4446,611245,4.0,2.0,"She's a great teacher. Lectures are mandatory, but she gives good notes and examples. The book is not needed, but the access code is required for quizzes and homework."
4447,611245,1.0,2.0,Kim Walters is the worst teacher I have ever had. She would be a great high school teacher but is a horrible professor. She gives assigned seats and makes the TA take roll every day. She does not allow you to leave early and if you decide to leave early she will call you out or mark you absent. She talks a lot about everything but the math.
4448,611245,5.0,4.0,"I loved Walters for Algebra, but do not recommend her for real numbers. She tests very harshly, and goes into unnecessary detail for this course. If you're looking at her for Real Numbers, do not take her. Take the other professor."
4449,611245,5.0,2.0,"Walters is very straight-forward with her lectures, and will help in any way she can if you don't understand something. She's very passionate and has plenty of office hours if you need extra help. She gives random easy extra credit through the year. There's homework, but it's easy to solve if you have the notes, which she teaches step-by-step."
4450,611245,4.0,2.0,"She is a really good teacher. If you take notes in class and study old homework, you should have no problem getting an A. She is always willing to answer questions and gives the short cuts for as many types of problems as possible."
4451,611245,5.0,3.0,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED MRS. WALTERS. She was by far the best math teacher I have ever had. College algebra was a breeze with her. She is quirky during class, helpful during lab, and all 4 tests were multiple choice. Print off the outline for the notes, take them to class, pay attention, and you'll do fine on the tests and quizzes."
4452,611245,2.0,4.0,"IF you are taking structure of real numbers, take the other teacher available. Walters makes this class way harder than it should be. Her tests aren't multiple choice but the other teachers is. also- cant use a calculator so learn your multiplication facts again"
4453,611245,4.5,4.0,"Ms. Walters is always excited and happy. The class may appear to be easy since it is grade school concepts however, you must review and study the material to do well on the tests. The two group projects are fair and they must go on for at least the minimum amount of time to even get a decent grade on it."
4454,611245,4.0,3.0,"Mrs. Walters was a very pleasant instructor.  She was extremely helpful in the Math Domain if you had an issue with homework or a quiz, and she was very methodical and detailed in lecture.  If you just show up, do your homework, and do the math, you'll make an A.  You don't have to be a math major to make an A."
4455,611245,1.0,5.0,Kim Walters is by far the WORST lab instructor/teacher I have ever had.  She gave the class a quiz on something we had not even learned yet.  Awful teacher.  She never emails you back if you have a problem and I have never seen her in the Math Domain.  She also takes attendance way too seriously.
4456,611245,1.5,5.0,Not good teacher. Made all A's in high school in math and taking her I make an F. She is all over the place and goes off topic all the time. I am here to learn algebra not hear about her kids or her personal life.
4457,611245,4.5,4.0,i had her for 3 semesters and worked my tail off but she can tell if you are trying and will help you any way she can. Best teacher that I have had at state
4458,611245,5.0,1.0,"she was awesome and really funny. you need the book but not a bad thing. i really liked the textbook and its integrated with a learning website were you can recap if you don't understand, never happens shes really good at explaining, and for doing hw."
4459,611245,5.0,3.0,nicest lady in the math lab.
4460,611245,5.0,1.0,"LOVED HER CLASS! She does everything in her power to assist the students, she's a very very nice teacher.  You miss a test, she'll let you make it up. Missed homework, she'll let you make it up. She's very very nice!"
4461,611245,3.5,3.0,"Overall, the was a good teacher. She was friendly and gladly welcomed questions."
4462,611245,1.5,4.0,her voice... ugh
4463,611245,5.0,2.0,LOVED HER! Very helpful and easy to understand. Explains the material thouroughly. I would definitely take her again!
4464,611245,5.0,2.0,I love her class. She keeps up awake with her enthusiasm.I wish I could take her for all of my math classes.She has no problem explaining or helping you out.She has mad my experience in college algebra a lot more intresting than it would have been.
4465,611245,1.5,3.0,Very Hiper !!
4466,611245,5.0,1.0,Good teacher.
4467,611245,4.5,3.0,The Math Lab sucks!!!
4468,611245,5.0,1.0,"I love Mrs. Walters. She's a really good teacher and she's always full of energy, so she keeps your attention."
4469,611245,4.5,2.0,No Comments
4470,611245,5.0,1.0,She is one of the best math teachers I have ever had. She is willing to help you in any way. She is very clear  and makes sure you understand what she is talking about. Always willing to help you if you are having trouble understanding.
4471,611245,4.5,2.0,Pretty straight forward. lots of outside work. not too hard. she is loud!!
4472,2192302,4.0,4.0,She is an extremely nice professor with a strong accent but easy to understand. She prepare yourself for exams with more questions and office hours. If you are willing to work for your grade she is the best teacher. Most exams gonna be MCQ style and you need to study well. I took the same class with Dr Hollis before and Dr Kuragama is 100 x better.
4473,2192302,4.0,4.0,"Lectures everyday by writing out notes and examples on the board. ALWAYS wiling to help you and makes sure that everyone understands because sometimes she can go a little fast, but will slow down if you ask. She provides extra office hours and help sessions too. Does lot of questions. VERY GOOD PROFESSOR. VERY NICE TOO"
4474,2192302,2.0,5.0,Do not take this professor. She has a very strong accent and is impossible to understand. You have to interpret what she is trying to say as her English is not very good. She does not know how to teach at a basic level; she is not a good teacher for an introductory Organic Chemistry class. She should be teaching higher level courses.
4475,2290608,5.0,4.0,"I love his style of teaching, and very informative. Take notes and don't miss his classes, you will do great."
4476,2290608,1.0,5.0,"The material in this class is difficult and with a professor that normally does research and was his first time teaching this class it was a mess. Over 70% percent of the class failed the first test. The second wasn't much better, but people did improve once they started teaching themselves as the prof. wasn't. I feel like I didn't learn anything."
4477,2331569,5.0,3.0,His lectures are very slow but much needed. Everything is open book so notes are IMPORTANT! Overall the class is laid back and an easy A class.
4478,2331569,4.0,3.0,Dr. Brown was a great teacher. He was funny and you can really tell he cares about his students. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you don't show be sure to watch the recorded lecture to take notes for tests and quizzes. assignments arent hard as long as you take notes and listen in class.
4479,2331569,3.0,3.0,"Despite the clear criteria, he tends to be subjective with the grading. Get ready to write a lot of notes. It was ok to take a course under teaching. He is willing to discuss work and further help after class. The exams are long and tough. I would take another course under him."
4480,2331570,2.0,4.0, she was very unorganized and would rarely respond to your email and the TA usually grades your papers. midterm did not get graded till the very end and she thinks that you know all of the material even when she does not teach it. the papers that you had to do were not clear on what she wanted us to write on. 
4481,2331570,1.0,5.0,"I loved learning about criminological theory but Dr. Johnson made it extremely difficult on me. She doesnt submit grades till much longer after we submitted them, changes the syllabus almost every week, and cannot be reached outside of class."
4482,2331570,2.0,2.0,"The lectures were poorly executed, she rarely responded to email or canvas messages. She assigns things with little to no time to properly do them. WOULD NOT TAKE AGAIN."
4483,2331570,5.0,2.0,I really enjoyed her class. I learned a lot and the work she assigned was not overwhelming or unrelated to the class. I would take her again. Exams were easy and straightforward. For the papers she gives a CLEAR outline of what she wants to see which makes it 10x easier.
4484,2331570,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Johnson is the most mediocre professor I've ever had. When she has a TA, grades come in very quickly, but don't expect that if it's just her. Even if you've gone to every class and paid attention in lecture, she writes her tests so it's impossible to be sure which answer is the one she wants. I try to avoid her classes at all costs."
4485,2331570,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Johnson is a great professor, always willing to help and no question is ever too dumb to be asked. Uses PowerPoints a lot which I prefer, has regular reading quizzes to make sure you're doing the assigned readings. Gives study guides for tests. Her points system is a little confusing but just trust the system and do the work and it'll be fine."
4486,2331570,3.0,2.0,"There are about 3-4 exams. Theres no busy work in this class, she focuses on the lesson without being overbearing. Do the assignments and come to class."
4487,2331568,3.0,5.0,I took her for the honors section. She had us read three books and write reviews. She was very nice but hard to follow during lectures. I was confused the whole class. Her exams are super difficult. You have to apply what you learn to random scenarios. I passed with an A but I cannot tell you a single thing about what she taught.
4488,2331568,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Peterson cares immensely about students and is very interested in teaching sociology and encouraging thought. I took the Honors section, which meant one or two articles to read per week, a few Canvas discussion posts, and a few longer writing assignments. She will tell you exactly what is on an exam."
4489,2331568,4.0,5.0,"So much reading and work, its a wonder how any of us made it through! Aside from the ridiculous work load, shes fantanstic professor. I would not recommend her unless the work load is significantly reduced. Nonetheless, she is a great professor providing and discussing intriguing material. Take at your own risk."
4490,2192320,5.0,1.0,"She makes the class very interesting, and she makes it easy to get an A! She drops your lowest grade and replaces it with the optional final. There are pop quizzes every class but the questions are easy and you can receive up to 10 bonus points on your tests just from the quizzes. I highly recommend this professor!!"
4491,2331604,2.0,4.0,"teaches from notes, also doesn't post said notes"
4492,1119191,4.0,3.0,"She is a good professor. There are no tests, but you will write a good amount and have to participate in the discussions to get an A. The only con is she does not give feedback on papers which is the core of her class."
4493,1119191,1.0,4.0,Gives vague assignment instructions(typically for opinion pieces) and grades them toughly with little to no feedback or a structured rubric. Seems like you just have to catch her on a good day to get a decent grade.
4494,1119191,5.0,3.0,"Be prepared to write. A lot. She requires responses to case studies in the text which are more or less opinion pieces, but still need to be well thought out in order to garner a decent grade. There is also a longer paper which needs to be researched, but so long as you do the work, you will get a decent grade."
4495,1119191,4.0,1.0,"No lectures, no tests, just A TON of papers. 6 papers a week, but super easy grader. She just wants to see that you are putting in the time to do it. Easy A"
4496,1119191,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Mallette comes to class the same way every day: riding a shark. Her lectures are easy to follow along with, especially after the industrial accident I suffered. Tests are fairly clear cut; questions are easy to follow, but the cheese maze is fairly difficult. I did enjoy Yoga Wednesdays, though. #flex #blessed"
4497,1119191,1.5,5.0,I do not recommend this professor. She makes classes so boring and some exams are really tough.
4498,1119191,2.0,2.0,"She's a terrible teacher.  She's a lawyer and a teacher on the side (and treats it that way).  She'd be at leat 10 minutes late everyday and doesn't tell you when she's cancelling class.  Talks about Southpark and Family Guy instead of material.  She's forgetful, but the class itself isn't very hard, she just can't teach."
4499,2536410,5.0,3.0,"Can be a tough grader, but genuinely wants to see you succeed. Great professor."
4500,2536410,2.0,4.0,"If youre looking for a professor that will actually teach you Spanish, dont take Davisson. The only thing he does in class is talk all in Spanish so if youve never had Spanish before, you wont understand a word. He uses worksheets that are busy work. His grading reflects if youre fluent or not, which isnt fair if youre just trying to learn."
4501,2159579,2.0,4.0,Dr. Jones knows the material very well. Do not take if you want a teacher that is at the university to help students succeed and not just do research. Was very unorganized in grading and had to change multiple test grades due to his errors and the complaints of the majority of the class. You will do at least 3 homework assignments a week.
4502,2159579,5.0,5.0,"Love this man! Cares deeply about his students. Very smart, open to new teaching ideas. Does a great job. You learn a lot if you put in the effort. If you can take this man, you better do it every time. DO IT YOU FOOL"
4503,2159579,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Jones is very passionate about the subject. He truly wants everyone to understand and use the class. He is not very nice when I comes to things at your fault, but will try his best to help you out."
4504,2159579,4.0,3.0,"He is a good professor, but you will need to read the textbook and use the online resources to learn the material before you go to class. He believes in a reverse classroom style. If you keep up outside of class you should have no problem making at least a B. Don't get too stressed about the practicums, they are more overwhelming than difficult."
4505,2536411,5.0,5.0,"She cares a lot about her students. She has office hours every week and makes lots of study guides and reviews, but the test are made with a few questions from every chem professor so they only help so much. This class is very difficult but she will do her best to explain the material. Go see her during office hours &amp;your life will be much easier."
4506,1684466,1.0,5.0,She is a horrible professor. Very boring and stumbles across material.
4507,1684466,2.5,3.0,She teaches Biology 1.
4508,2044919,5.0,3.0,"I took her class during summer but there arent enough nice things to say. She made her expectations very clear and was always willing to provide clarification for assignments. Her feedback was amazing. I had a low B in 1103, but had a very high A in this course."
4509,2044919,2.0,4.0,"When writing papers, she will give a clear grading scale but it is very hard to please her(she works in the writing center). Unless you know how to write papers, this class will not be easy. There are chances for extra credit throughout the semester-do every single one! Overall: be ready to work!"
4510,2044919,5.0,2.0,Best Comp instructor ever! Always willing to help!
4511,2044919,1.0,5.0,I would not recommend you take this class unless you are super super good at writing essays. Though attendance is not mandatory you better go because if not you will likely miss something. She is SO slow at grading you barely get your first draft back in time to write the final draft and she is very hard to please
4512,2044919,1.0,4.0,"Today is Wednesday, December 6. Tomorrow is the final exam. I have no idea how I am doing in this course. Of the 900 points possible, only 400 are in the gradebook. This includes 2 essays, one of which was turned in at the end of October. Do not take this course with this instructor unless you are a God of English, because she cannot be pleased."
4513,2044919,1.0,5.0,"Very harsh grader. If you ever miss class, you will miss quizzes and will probably loose 5-10 points every single time. She does give extra credit for going to the writing centre and completing extra revision assignments but without them getting an A in her class is nearly impossible. Avoid her if you can or take the course later with someone else."
4514,2044919,1.0,5.0,"Attendance is mandatory, homework is excessive, and she's impossible to please. The most monotone voice with little knowledge of english herself. Do not take this class, its the worst."
4515,2044919,1.0,5.0,The worst class I've ever taken. Homework every single night... and its just busy work. You'll feel like you're sitting in Kindergarten again. She grades incredibly hard and takes forever to grade. Only a few days left in the semester and I still don't know what my grades are.
4516,2044919,1.0,5.0,"Dont do it. This is the hardest class I've ever taken. It's harder than 4000 level classes. She is the toughest grader in ways that are completely unnecessary. Also, she takes FOREVER to grade. You won't get your grades back to know how you're doing until its too late. Almost through with the semester and I've only gotten 2/4 grades back."
4517,2044919,1.0,5.0,Toughest English professor at MSU. She is extremely demanding. Hardly anyone gets an A in her class. Try and avoid if possible.
4518,2044919,4.0,4.0,"She was my instructor for Comp 1 class. She is a tough grader but goes out of the way if you are willing to work hard.  Make sure you follow her instructions and be regular in class, you will definitely get an A!"
4519,2085886,4.5,2.0,"Economics is not the easiest subject, however Dr. Freeman does everything he can to make it easy on the students. His lectures are long and fairly boring, but his tests come directly from the lectures. You really don't need the book unless you want a different perspective. You get points for class participation. Do some studying and you'll be fine."
4520,2438145,5.0,4.0,"She is a wonderful professor and really wants all of her students to do well. She explains things very clearly and is patient in answering questions. She is a little tough and requires a lot of reading, but it is a philosophy class. I learned so much in her class and would definitely take her again if given the opportunity."
4521,2782221,2.0,4.0,"Mrs. Dudgeon is a very caring teacher. She cares about her students and I believe does want us to understand and succeed. Where I struggled was when her lectures and homework was based on formulas in excel, BUT her tests were all hand written. I feel like I would have done better if the material was delivered in just one form."
4522,2782221,2.0,5.0,"If you dont have much patience, do not take her. She poorly organized the class so we would get out in 15 minutes at the start of the semester, by the at the end of the semester, we would run out of time. She would ask for questions and wait for 5 minutes in silence looking at us. She was hard to reach by email and was generally inexperienced."
4523,168977,5.0,4.0,"Yes, Dr. C's lectures are incredible & required. Makes material relatable & easy to understand & apply IRL. Grade based off 4 exams, final, workbook & optional extra credit book test. Requires many hours outside class to study, fill in gaps in your notes, and LOTS of reading. Highly recommend Dr. C if you can & are willing to work for your grade."
4524,168977,4.0,1.0,"even though there is way too much non related reading material, class is super easy. tests are T/F. he always tells stories during lecture. attendance is mandatory! he takes attendance via assigned seats. one opportunity for extra credit!"
4525,168977,2.0,5.0,"Dr C is a great human, but he gives way too much work to do. It is an elective. there shouldnt be 5 different books to read. The tests are super hard. He sometimes skips notes and expects us to know it on our own and go back and fill them in. He expects to do too much. Do not take this class unless you want to spend all your free time studying."
4526,168977,4.0,4.0,"Dr. C was super nice in my opinion, hes been teaching a long time and I think he does a great job. The class in my opinion epitomized lecture but he was humorous with his anecdotes and stories."
4527,168977,5.0,1.0,"Dr. C is an absolute gem. I had no interest in psychology before taking this class. However, Dr. C managed to make the material interesting and easy to understand. I cannot recommend him enough. "
4528,168977,5.0,2.0,"Dr. C is perhaps the most iconic professor at this university, not only for the number of students he has pass through his general psychology course, but also for his amazing lectures and wonderful attitude. I would not trust you if you didn't like him. His choice of books are a little uneven, but everything else makes up for it. Take him."
4529,168977,4.0,5.0,"Great professor. I took the honors section and have never spent more time (lecture + hw) dedicated to one class than this one. Thankfully the lectures and books were interesting, but be careful about taking the honors section if your course load is already heavy"
4530,168977,5.0,3.0,"I LOVE Dr. C. I thought his class was very interesting but he is very strict on electronics, attendance, and if you are taking notes. If you miss over 3 classes then you drop a letter grade. Gives an extra credit project, DO IT. Its not hard, you read a book and write 2 paragraphs on it. Not Hard!! You're only graded on tests and your workbook. "
4531,168977,5.0,3.0,really good at his job even though extremely liberal
4532,168977,5.0,4.0,"I absolutely loved this class.  His lectures were great, and I enjoyed the required reading.  Yes, this class requires some reading and studying.  If you do everything correctly, it is an easy A.  GO TO CLASS AND DO THE READING!  Look over notes.  I highly recommend taking Dr. Carskadons class.  He is a legend at State:"
4533,168977,4.0,5.0,"Super fun guy. The only textbook is his workbook he wrote. STUDY THAT! I finished with a 78, but I didnt study it that much. You should do fine!"
4534,168977,3.0,5.0,"If you miss class more than three times your grade goes a third of a letter grade. He was a fun professor and his lectures and the information was very enjoyable and interesting, but its like he doesnt realize we take other classes. There were five assigned books not related to the material at all and he never even explains why we read them."
4535,168977,1.0,4.0,I already wrote a rating but this is the 5th time he always finds a way to talk about sex in class. This time he was going through sleep cycles and got on to the changing of womens and mens body parts during arousal. A lot of people were very uncomfortable. He goes over board with stuff like that and it gets hard to deal with in a big class.
4536,168977,1.0,4.0,I hate this class. 5 books (1 he wrote about msu and his opinion) are assigned. None are about the class. Assigned seating yet tells everyone to sit in front of the class? They check for your attendance. Told everyone they need to get the vaccine. Only get help at SI/office hours yet dont accommodate for those who have another classes.
4537,168977,5.0,4.0,"Dr. C is a fantastic professor, as he gives great lectures (with entertaining examples) and assigns wonderful books to aid in application of the concepts discussed in class. He was always available and understanding if you needed him (even in an online class) and cared very much about your progress in class. A true gem of a professor at MSU."
4538,168977,5.0,4.0,"Dr. C is an amazing teacher who puts his all into his class despite having hundreds of students to teach. If you really pay attention to the lectures and read all the material that he assigns, you will LOVE this class. The most important thing is to stay on top of all of the work. If you do that, this class will be amazing!"
4539,168977,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Carskadon was an amazing professor! I did not even want to take psychology, I simply took it because it was a degree requirement, but he made me love it!"
4540,168977,4.0,4.0,I took this course online and it was by far the most time-consuming class I took. He is very entertaining in lectures but required us to read four books on top of our normal lectures and it adds up quickly. The books were all enjoyable but be ready to do lots of work.
4541,168977,5.0,2.0,"One of the best teachers I have ever had the pleasure of being taught. I took his 4-week online course and had a blast. His lectures were engaging and even though it was an online accelerated course, I can comfortably say I learned a lot. The papers are really easy and the workbook he gives you is very easy. The books were also very great read."
4542,168977,5.0,4.0,"Dr. C is the most precious man alive! His lectures are so enjoyable and include such good stories! I HATE to read, everything I read, I enjoyed ALOT! His tests aren't the easiest &amp; he makes you work for your grade. Use SI, it is so so helpful! He may not be an easy A, but I promise you'll feel left out and regretful if you don't have him!"
4543,168977,3.0,4.0,His lectures are hilarious. Definitely worth taking his class just for the lectures. He's an interesting guy. Very strict with attendance and phone policies which is annoying and the TAs are hit or miss. His tests are rough. Entirely true/false and the way he phrases questions will trip you up. Also gives a ton of required reading.
4544,168977,4.0,2.0,"Dr. C is a great professor and inspired me to be more interested in psychology as a subject. The class is just note taking and lectures, but he tells great stories and relates them to the topics being covered. Tests are all t/f, easy if you study. Definitely recommend."
4545,168977,5.0,2.0,"Dr. C is an amazing psychology professor. His lectures are interesting, he makes the material meaningful, and tests arent too difficult. Highly recommend his class for any student required to take general psychology"
4546,168977,2.0,4.0,"Despite the good reviews I hated the class. He gives T/F tests and does not grade you on the knowledge but rather if you can catch his tricks. There are also 3 novels read outside of class PLUS a required book he wrote himself. NOT an easy A. If youre not willing to read outside of class and study HARD for ever test, DO NOT TAKE."
4547,168977,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Carskadon is such a delight! He's hilarious and he makes the material so interesting and relatable. You will be reading a lot in his class, so if you don't want to do that, don't take him. You don't need the textbook, but you do need the workbook he assigned for notetaking."
4548,168977,3.0,5.0,"I wouldnt say Dr. C was the best... but I wouldnt say he was the worst either. His lectures are nice he tries to give you examples the best way that he can. Take notes! Go to class! you should be great. Test are tricky tho. 33 T or F questions. he only gives 1 extra credit and that is reading a book recommended which is passgood, fail fail :("
4549,168977,5.0,3.0,If you have the chance you should take Dr. C. His lectures are amazing and he genuinely cares about his students. His exams are all true/false but they are very fair and take from the workbook. Overall he is a great professor and I would highly recommend him!
4550,168977,4.0,4.0,"Dr C's class is one of the most interesting courses I've taken. The lectures are very interesting and its not very hard to pay attention in his class. Though if you are looking for an easy A, do not take this class. The other general psych professors are much easier but you get a lot more from Dr.C he's practically got his system down to a science"
4551,168977,5.0,3.0,"Dr. C is one of my favorite professors. His lectures are always so interesting. His tests are really easy and are about 30 true and false questions. You have to read a book for basically every test, but the books are interesting. I would definitely take him again."
4552,168977,5.0,3.0,"Dr. C is the best professor I have ever had. I took him for Honors Psych, and on the first day, he made it a point to learn everyone's name in the class of 18 students. He refers to us by name during his lectures, and he really does get to know us as individuals. His lectures are very interesting, and full of stories. The tests are all True/False."
4553,168977,5.0,4.0,"Dr. C is a tough teacher, but worth it in the end. He's funny and tells good stories to show the psychology that he's being taught. Filling out the mandatory workbook is the best way to study for tests. The tests are all true/false, but if you have studied, you should do fine."
4554,168977,5.0,3.0,"Dr. C is a great and respected professor here. If you are taking gen psych, take him! He is hilarious and won't put you to sleep. You MUST go to class and take notes in the book he requires. NO phones and assigned seats are given. If you take the notes and study them, you'll do great!"
4555,168977,5.0,2.0,"He's so funny! I'd reccommend sitting in the front. There is a fair amount of reading, but the books he chooses are very interesting. He uses his workbook that you have to buy, but there's no psychology textbook. Very funny, gives extra credit, AND sings happy birthday."
4556,168977,5.0,2.0,"Loved him! Easy to pay attention and enjoy lectures. You have to go, or your grade will be affected. Gives extra credit opportunity even though it's not that hard to do good in the first place. Assigns a lot of reading but the books are enjoyable. I recommend listening to audio books while driving, walking to class, etc to make it easier!"
4557,168977,1.0,5.0,Hated this class. There's true and false tests but he tricks you with wording. Sometimes he can get obnoxious and loud in class which can make it hard to understand why he is even saying. He gives you pointless books to read for tests but once the test comes around he only includes about 5 questions from the book so it's a waste of time to read
4558,168977,5.0,2.0,"Loved Dr. C! His class was very enjoyable despite the no technology rule, the assigned seats, and the true/false tests. Take good notes in the workbook and study for the tests, and I can guarantee you'll love the lecture! Outstanding professor! Definitely, recommend for incoming Freshman to welcome you to campus!"
4559,168977,5.0,3.0,I love Dr. C!! He is the sweetest man and tests are completely true/false! His lectures are the best and so funny. Easy A!
4560,168977,5.0,4.0,"He was a very interesting man. I loved going to class and listening to his lectures, but his tests are very tricky. If you aren't good with true or false, DO NOT take his class. Very strict rules. If you do not follow them, your grade will be affected. GO TO CLASS. you will fail if you do not go."
4561,168977,5.0,5.0,He was interesting to listen to and very inspirational
4562,168977,1.0,4.0,He doesnt use visual aids in lecture. He just makes you buy a notebook and you have to fill in what you hear him say. His tests are hard unless you study hard. He gives 2 reading assignments unlike any other psych teacher. His rules are crazy and if you break them your grade WILL be affected. Im an A/B student who got a D in his class.
4563,168977,5.0,4.0,Hes very entertaining and keeps the class engaged. He tells stories to help students remember terms or items.
4564,168977,5.0,2.0,"Favorite teacher by far at MSU. He has a great personality and story for every topic in your workbook. Try to get in his honors class if possible, he adds extra bonus points. Study a night or two before the test and take good notes in class and do journals every week and it will be a given A basically. Highly recommend him"
4565,168977,5.0,4.0,Dr. C is all around a great person. He really cares for you and the lass. His lectures are filled with stories that relate to the topic and really get the idea in your head. All his tests are True/False which can be a blessing and a curse. Just study the workbook and pay attention in class (and go to class) and you should easily get an A.
4566,168977,5.0,4.0,Amazing teacher but tests are hard
4567,168977,5.0,3.0,"Uses a pre-outlined workbook for notes which I loved! Not many tests, but gave a lot of extra reading materials that you're tested on. Study at least a week in advance because tests are tricky true/false. Tells incredible stories. Fair attendance policy; I wouldn't have wanted to miss his class anyway. Do not buy the textbook. Use quizlet to study"
4568,168977,5.0,2.0,"Had a lot of fun in this class. His lectures are very interesting, and keep you on your toes. The workbook is where you take notes and he literally says the answers word for word. Pay attention to the study guides, because some of the questions will be on the exam. 3 exams that are all T/F. Never even opened my textbook."
4569,168977,5.0,1.0,"Attendance is absolutely mandatory, but Dr. C's class is very interesting and well worth the effort to just show up. His tests are very short and easy, and his lectures are very unique. My only advice is to take an honors section, if possible. Having a smaller class size makes this class a lot more fun."
4570,168977,3.0,4.0,Carskadon is super tough about attendance and your notebook grades at the end of the semester. His TA's will count you absent if you're doing anything but paying attention. Only 4 tests but cover extensive amounts of material.
4571,168977,4.0,3.0,"Solid professor. He likes to stress the importance of tests, which is great, but he absolutely loves to trick the students with the wording on tests. You will have assigned seats in this class. There are lots of little things you must complete other than just the workbook outside of class. Youll probably have to read 3-4 books during the semester"
4572,168977,5.0,3.0,"Dr. C is an awesome professor! For notes in his class, you buy a workbook and just fill it out during class. It's super easy and he makes class really interesting and fun. You have an easy chance to earn extra credit. I would say the textbook is definitely not necessary, but the 2 additional reading books are."
4573,168977,5.0,2.0,One of my favorite professors. if you take notes and listen you will do just fine!
4574,168977,5.0,3.0,"If you pay attention, ask a few questions, and study for a hour or so you will be fine."
4575,168977,5.0,4.0,"Dr. C is a gem of a professor. His lectures are engaging, funny, and full of useful information. The books he assigns us to read are always page-turners, and he really cares about his &quot;scholars!&quot; if you have a chance to take his class, don't pass it up!!"
4576,168977,4.0,2.0,"Good professor, but his stories make me worry about his mental state."
4577,168977,5.0,4.0,"I took Dr. C for General Psych. He's taught at MSU for 44 years, so he's very knowledgable. He has a &quot;story&quot; for practically every topic we covered. I went to almost every SI session which really helped. You MUST study for the tests; they're all T/F. His motto: &quot;I will always try to trick you, but I never hope to succeed.&quot;"
4578,168977,5.0,3.0,Lectures are very interesting and attendance counts for a grade. If you understand it and relate the examples to the material you will be fine. Tests are 33 questions of true/false
4579,168977,5.0,4.0,There are some required readings. Attendance is absolutely required if you do not want to purchase the textbook and if you want to be exempt. The TAs' he have are wonderfully helpful.
4580,168977,5.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. C's class!!! His lectures were always really entertaining and memorable, which really helped when studying for the tests. He offers an extra credit assignment at the end of the semester that really can help boost your grade. His tests can be a little tricky, they're all true-false questions."
4581,168977,5.0,3.0,Absolutely LOVED Dr. C's class!
4582,168977,5.0,4.0,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Dr. C's class! It is difficult, but you just have to remember it isn't like high school and you can't cram for his tests! You should definitely start studying several weeks in advanced for even a small amount of time!"
4583,168977,5.0,4.0,Dr. C's Social Psychology class was the best class I've taken so far. He made class interesting and lively. I looked forward to going to class every MWF and never skipped once. His tests are very easy if you take good notes; they're all true false but super simple. 10/10 I would definitely take again!
4584,168977,5.0,3.0,I love Dr. C! His class was fun and it's hard NOT to learn something in there!
4585,168977,5.0,4.0,"Dr. C is the best professor I have ever had. His lectures are merely amazing and the workbook used for class is extremely helpful too. He made us read 2 books during the semester and another one for extra credit but they are all very good books. The tests questions are all true-false and a little bit tricky but if you study, you will be fine."
4586,168977,5.0,2.0,He's awesome !!
4587,168977,5.0,2.0,"Dr. C is a great teacher. His lectures are full of stories which helps make the material easier to memorize. His tests are all True or False and we will try to trick you, but if you know the material then you will be fine! You also can get an extra 4 points to overall final grade if you read an extra book that he assigns to you."
4588,168977,5.0,4.0,"His tests are a pain, but his lecture is worth it. Can't miss more than 4 days, and Fridays count double."
4589,168977,5.0,3.0,"He's an amazing man. He doesn't do cell phones, they're a major no in his class."
4590,168977,2.5,2.0,"tests are always multiple choice! you will have a lot of material and most of the test will all be about the same general topic, so either way you have to be ready to study everything. I really enjoyed the course though, Dr. C is an amazing teacher and loves every ""scholar"" he teachers."
4591,168977,3.0,2.0,"One review says it's a tradition to take Dr. C, and that's pretty much true. He's great. The class is an easy A as long as you stay on top of getting your 6 PRP (not hard-just don't wait until October to start), and you do the readings for the tests. His first test is about MSU traditions ( easy A if you study). Take advantage of the 3 point bonus"
4592,168977,3.5,3.0,"Carskadon is a fun professor. His stories can get a bit long and you may get lost while taking notes. If you actually study for his tests then they're easy. His extra credit book assignment (for PSY1013) adds 3 points to your final grade, so utilize it. Go to class and you'll be alright."
4593,168977,2.5,3.0,"Many people enjoy this class, but I did not. The syllabus he gives you is not even half of the full syllabus and his first text requires you to know most of it. His tests aren't hard as long as you study. MUST GO TO CLASS"
4594,168977,3.0,3.0,"Attendence is a must in this class! All his tests are true/ false formation so if that is not your strong point, I suggest reconsidering. Personally, I did not enjoy the class at all. Many do, however, I did not. It is more of a tradition to take Dr.C than it is necessary. If extra credit is offered, take full advantage!"
4595,168977,5.0,3.0,"Dr. C was great. His lectures were funny and helpful to understanding the material. Make sure to take notes in his mandatory notebook though as the test questions will come straight out of it. Speaking of tests, they are all 100% truefalse, which generally I hate; however, these were not too hard as long as you study the notebook closely"
4596,168977,4.0,4.0,"Don't take him if you don't like to read!! We didn't have any tests other than the final take home (which is pretty tough), but we did have a 3 page journal due every other week. However, he has the best lectures that I have yet my entire college career!"
4597,168977,4.5,4.0,"If you go to class and study a little bit, then you should be fine."
4598,168977,4.0,2.0,"There is more work than i expected from an elective course, but it was a fun and informative class. Dr. C makes his lectures interesting. I would recommend sitting close, though!"
4599,168977,5.0,1.0,TAKE THIS CLASS. It was absolutely my favorite class and Dr. C is hilarious! 
4600,168977,4.0,3.0,he's a cute little old man who rambles on about the same question for 20 minutes. he's a cool guy just make sure you go to class and always take notes and pay attention 
4601,168977,4.0,3.0,"Very funny, makes what could be a terribly boring class a little better. He goes over everything that will be on tests and the tests are pretty easy as long as you read over the notes a few times. The only issue is that there are only 4-5 test grades and that's all you'll get, so you've got to keep up."
4602,168977,4.0,1.0,One of my favorite courses this year. His class is only lecture with note taking every class. He teaches through his personal stories which is great. Attendance is strictly enforced! Don't get caught with a cell phone either. This equates to 5 ABSENCES! Overall great (funny) professor easy class
4603,168977,5.0,1.0,"I really enjoyed taking this class. Dr. C is awesome, he really knows his tuff on psychology. I especially liked his funny stories, that would go with chapters in our book. The tests are very easy. The tests are formatted in True or False. Attendence is very important!!!"
4604,168977,2.0,4.0,"I'm not a fan. I learned so little. He tells entertaining stories, but they confuse me more often than help. He also has a really awful syllabus and if you don't read it you're probably going to make a mistake and get dropped a letter grade. And the formats for his test are AWFUL!!!! I'd say avoid him. It's not an easy or informative class."
4605,168977,4.0,2.0,Makes Psychology interesting. Has funny stories for every vocabulary term. Definitely recommend taking him!
4606,168977,5.0,3.0,"Dr. C has ALWAYS been one of my favorite teachers, he will make you laugh and if you have him early in the morning, it is NOT hard to focus in his class. I had him for both gen psych and social. i practically skipped to his class everyday."
4607,168977,5.0,1.0,Very interesting! You will laugh everyday in his class! He has tons of funny stories and examples! I have not heard one bad thing about this man!
4608,168977,5.0,2.0,"Dr. C is the best professor in the WORLD! He is funny, nice, and is a great guy! You cant miss class. I had him for social and gen psych and loved everyday of it!! Take his class, you'll love it!"
4609,168977,1.0,3.0,"This man is squirrely!  He screams into the microphone a lot and I think he's experienced every psychological phenomena according to his examples.  Be sure to go to class, he drop you a letter grade after 3.  Avoid him!"
4610,168977,5.0,1.0,Awesome professor!! Best I've had and I'm a senior
4611,168977,5.0,1.0,I passed his class with an A. He is a very good teacher and his stories help a lot with test.
4612,168977,5.0,2.0,Dr. C's class was the ONLY one that I actually wanted to go to. He makes it interesting and always has stories to tack onto the subject material. And he's the cutest old man ever!
4613,168977,5.0,2.0,Dr. C is the coolest of the cool!!!
4614,168977,5.0,3.0,"He's a great teacher and extremely interesting, doesn't give homework.  His tests are all true/false, tricky and cover a lot of material.  I definetely recommend him!!"
4615,168977,5.0,3.0,"Dr. C. is a wonderful teacher who truly cares about the success of his students.  His tests can be tricky, but you won't regret taking his class."
4616,168977,4.5,2.0,He is SUCH a great teacher...I will miss him next semester!!! He always has great stories to make his class interesting. If you have the chance...take Dr. C's class!!!!
4617,168977,5.0,1.0,"I enjoy and look forward to class.  His stories are great and interesting. I would love to have him as a professor again, he's by far my favorite.  Plus, the class is easy and very educational.  He gives plenty of opportunities to raise your grade, too."
4618,168977,4.5,1.0,"Great guy, fun and easy class, and you also learn something.  Definitely take him."
4619,168977,5.0,1.0,good
4620,168977,5.0,1.0,"I love this class. I would say that of my 2 years at State, Dr. C is my favorite professor. I think his stories are funny, and they provide a great chance to fill in the workbook before he goes to the next point. If you have to take a psyc class for your major, you've got to take Dr. C."
4621,168977,3.5,1.0,"easy teacher, but very boring. his voice will grate on your nerves. tells too many pointless stories and always keeps you until the very last second. easy tests. i recommend taking his class, just make sure you're wide awake."
4622,168977,3.0,4.0,Lots and lots of work.
4623,168977,5.0,1.0,This is my first class of the day and I can actually stay awake through it. That's saying alot.
4624,168977,5.0,3.0,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome.  Dr. C. is the man!  But you better read the syllabus and read those books!"
4625,168977,3.5,2.0,No Comments
4626,168977,5.0,2.0,he's cool
4627,168977,4.0,1.0,a great teacher who get everyone involved and laughing.
4628,168977,1.0,3.0,"Gives 15-question tests w/ 10 minute time limit, and he adds in distractors with instructions to &quot;ignore&quot; the stupid, irrelevant sentences. That tells you something about how seriously this guy takes his job. In short, he's a tenured idiot."
4629,168977,5.0,3.0,"Took two of his honors level courses and had a blast.  Took personality theories with him as well... he good have been a little more comprehensive, but what was presented was useful and thought provoking."
4630,168977,1.0,2.0,Never saw the guy...  Used a grad assist the whole time..  Whar's up with that&#63;
4631,168977,4.5,4.0,"Too good a teacher. How he could getall 150 of us in an auditorium involved, I'll never know."
4632,168977,5.0,3.0,I had Dr. C. for Gen. Psych. years ago. I am now a full time Psychology Instructor. Thanks!!!
4633,168977,3.5,2.0,"Dr. C tells great stories to help you remember test material. Tests are so easy...all you have to do is read through your notes once, maybe twice and you will get an A"
4634,168977,4.5,4.0,"It was the most amusing class I've ever had. However, I was not as prepared for later psych classes as I should have been."
4635,168977,1.5,3.0,His grading style has nothing to do with ability. Some of his test questions have no revelance to the class. He presents theroy as fact.
4636,168977,4.5,3.0,Graduated years ago and still love him
4637,168977,5.0,1.0,"An excellent teacher, and quite hilarious.  Funnest class I've ever taken."
4638,635928,3.5,2.0,ok ckass
4639,635928,5.0,2.0,Very nice and fair. Tries to make this class interesting. If you have an A going into the final she will exempt you. Awesome!
4640,2085913,3.0,1.0,"Required class for ADS Majors. Guest speaker each week (depends who guest is if class is interesting or not). Assignments: Required $5 book to write reflections, selfie scavenger hunt around campus, 2 page paper on an internship or study abroad type thing you want to do (super easy). Takes a while to grade things, but they are mostly effort grades."
4641,2085913,5.0,1.0,I really enjoyed this class! It taught me so many new things that I didn't know about agriculture and society! It is amazing how they correlate.
4642,2085913,4.0,2.0,"The class is basically an info class about the do's and dont's of animal and dairy sciences. I found it extremely helpful, having a lot of questions about vet school an general jobs within  animal and dairy sciences. The lectures are just guest speakers. The class requires a little time to do the few projects and papers, but they are grades easy."
4643,2085913,4.5,1.0,Mrs. Graves really tries to be there for students and help them. The class that I took with her did not have any tests - just three projects that were all really easy. The only things negatives are that she doesn't really respond to emails and takes a really long time to grade things. She is very nice though and wants to help.
4644,2520094,4.0,1.0,"I really appreciated her lectures. They were funny, informative, and felt very original. This class was a breath of fresh air in a stressful semester. I highly recommend taking her for any class you have."
4645,2520094,5.0,1.0,"Great professor for engineering stats. I had this class online and it was only half a semester. She mainly cares about attempting the problems and giving an effort. Graded on participation because I made a 100 on every assignment regardless of whether it was right or wrong. This was an easy, laid-back class that you could learn at your own pace."
4646,2520094,5.0,2.0,Shes a super easy teacher. Shes super nice too. I would email her and she always responded to me fairly quickly and answered all my questions. The assignments were really easy and were basically participation grades. If you turned it in with some work on it you were probably getting a hundred no matter what you put. Would definitely recommend her
4647,2520094,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic professor. Truly cares about students and conducts her class focused predominantly on learning and not accurately grading us. If you go to class and do the work, you should get an A. She is willing to help explain things if you do not understand. Summer class was laid back, no stress at all, and a genuinely fun class to have. 10/10"
4648,2520094,5.0,1.0,Great professor. She is super nice and friendly! I would definitely take it again. She puts more emphasis on learning than on grades. 10/10 class.
4649,2683938,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Binford is confusing, but he really does grow on you. I did not like him at first, but everything falls into place when you least expect it. I respect him now that I am looking back."
4650,2683938,4.0,3.0,This man is great honestly! He is a little weird but in the funny way. He is makes everything connect back to the main point of education.
4651,2323519,4.0,2.0,"I absolutely adore Professor Liu. She covers a lot of material during lectures, so if you go to class and pay attention you should pass. It can sometimes be hard to pay attention but if you're disciplined you'll catch the hints she gives for tests. Overall, a very fair grader and is more than willing to help you outside of class."
4652,2323519,1.0,5.0,"She was hard to reach outside of class. Lab was an absolute joke with awful TAs. Her tests are so difficult. I studied for 2 weeks to still make a C on tests. Please stop doing &quot;If you change this, what happens?&quot; types of questions. She told us she would do review videos for test 4 (final) and did not. I was 2 questions away from an A. So difficult"
4653,2323519,2.0,5.0,Her tests are very hard to study for. The material is very difficult. I have a feeling that the majority of my class was not doing well considering around test 3 she posted review videos. If she continues to do this it will help you tremendously... if not well good luck Charlie.
4654,2323519,1.0,4.0,"worst professor I've had in 3 years at MSU and it doesn't help that the class is hard material to begin with. all she does is read from the powerpoint and doesn't engage with the class at all. you have to study A LOT on your own to do well on the tests, which are way more specific than her lectures. sucks that shes the only prof offered for phys."
4655,2323519,4.0,4.0,"Bin Liu is a good teacher. You do not need to book, she provides powerpoint slides to study from. The class is challenging, but if you study you will be fine. Attendance is not mandatory but it helps a lot because she explains the material. Would definitely recommend her."
4656,2323519,1.0,4.0,"Shes pretty horrible, will powerpoint you to death, does not give any insight, just reads off the slides for an hour. Incredibly hard to stay awake and if you make a poor grade its on you, she thinks shes doing a great job. Dont take her. Coming from an A,B student!"
4657,2323519,1.0,4.0,This class is sooooooooooooooooooo boring !!!!!!!!!!!! 3 Test and nuncumlative final ! Test are very conceptual but learn-able! Just all so boring! get ready to be bored ! Lab are cool though.
4658,2683979,5.0,1.0,This was the easiest of the companion animal classes I've taken. Very straight to the point. Plenty of time to get everything done.
4659,2683979,1.0,5.0,Refuse to answer emails. She is not the most approachable person as she can be a little snarky.  There are guidelines that are not shown in the syllabus or the assignments. She might be a good online professor but she is a horrible in person teacher. She takes orientation way to seriously. 
4660,2683979,5.0,1.0,This was an extremely fun class. Modules were published each week and you had assignments due the following Sunday. There are a decent amount of lectures so it is important to watch them to do the quizzes and assignments. Everything is clear-cut grade-wise so you'll be guaranteed a good grade.
4661,2683979,5.0,1.0,"I loved Mrs. Carroll! The class was really fun because it's an easy subject matter to become passionate about. There are weekly assignments that are unlocked every Monday and are due the following Sunday. As long as you watch her lectures and take notes here and there, you'll get an A."
4662,2683979,1.0,5.0,"Quizzes were nearly impossible. She made them during class on petty material that wasn't really mentioned. Maybe better for an online class, but for in person Orientation to ADS, not good at all. Too much work for a 1 credit hour class."
4663,2683979,1.0,5.0,"She would make quizzes for the next class during the lecture, in front of the students. Wasnt easy to get a hold of in person. She might be better for online, but In person will only make you work harder than you should for only a 1-hour course."
4664,2683979,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Carroll is INCREDIBLE! She is extremely passionate about the subject matter, and she is easily accessible outside of class to discuss questions and interest in the topics. Her coursework is organized, clear, and interesting. This is easily one of the best online classes I have ever taken. If you need an Evaluation elective, this is the one!"
4665,2683979,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Erica Carroll was a great Companion Animal Eval. instructor! Her asynchronous online class was very well organized, &amp; she gave you plenty of time to do the assignments each week, although they're not very time consuming. She makes the class fun, and you can tell she's very passionate about it. The 3 exams do make or break your grade though."
4666,2683995,5.0,3.0,"Loved her class, she was pretty direct with what she wanted and the assignments werent bad. Cared for all of her students and still talks to me when I see her."
4667,2683995,3.0,4.0,i didnt care for her
4668,2683997,3.0,3.0,She is the head over the interior design department and she grades a little harder. If you have an online class with her you could pass. But she has long test. 70 questions in an hour.
4669,2258044,4.0,3.0,Professor Doughty is great and super passionate about what she is teaching. She is very chill and she will be more than willing to help you outside of class. There are ALOT of weekly quizzes on MindTap so be prepared to keep up with their due dates. She assigns a few papers and a lesson plan but they're fairly easy and she will be happy to help!
4670,1856643,4.0,3.0,"Good teacher, will explain things and be casual. Impossible to get a hold of outside of class, doesn't check his email, canvas, phone, and neither do the TAs."
4671,1856643,3.0,2.0,"I had him for Engineering Economy I. It is NOT an exciting class.  He is an ok teacher but is very by-the-books, cut and dry.  His class starts out incredibly easy but ends up really hard.  Do the homework and study for the tests and you'll be fine.  He is not a super exciting teacher but I think that's because he's a little new.  I'd recommend him"
4672,1856642,3.0,3.0,"Simsiriwong is not an easy teacher.  She tried a new teaching method this year in which she passed out notes and followed along instead of writing your own.  She's hard to follow at times and gets confused.  Her tests are fair but she is AMAZING with partial credit.  Overall, I would recommend her for Mechanics of Materials, but she's not easy."
4673,2536607,5.0,2.0,"This course is composed of weekly reading accountability done at the beginning of class, 2 projects, a discussion board, 3 tests, and a paper. Lots of work but enjoyable if you put in effort. Can't skip since the accountability is done in class and stacks up if you miss enough. You need the book."
4674,2536607,4.0,4.0,"I had her for comp 2 and though the class had paper after paper week after week, she made the writing easier. It was comp 2 so constantly writing papers in reasonable but she was able to help on every way possible."
4675,2536607,4.0,2.0,she's very nice. is clear about what she expects in her papers. lets class out early a lot.
4676,2536607,5.0,3.0,"Great Comp 2 professor. If you can get her, take her. Very nice and understanding. Also explains material well so you know what is expected of you."
4677,2536607,5.0,1.0,I had her for intro to Lit and she was excellent. She gives lots of small assignments to pad your grade that aren't difficult. Her tests are a little hard but if you read the stories in depth and review lecture notes you can get a good grade. She is good about giving partial credit and willing to work with you on deadlines.
4678,2536607,5.0,3.0,"Gives really good feedback on each draft so we know what needs to be fixed. Funny in lecture, makes the material understandable, and gives extra credit. One of the few teachers that I feel genuinely cares about her students."
4679,2536607,5.0,3.0,Currently taking her Intro to Lit class. A lot of reading but it is a literature class. Tries to help in any way that she can.
4680,2536607,5.0,3.0,Professor Kimbrell is an amazing English Comp professor. She's not one to hold students till the end of class. She teaches students to be independent but is willing to help when needed. Lectures are interesting. As long as you respect her she'll respect you.
4681,2536607,3.0,4.0,"Ms. Kimberll was an adequate English professor for Comp. I. She was very helpful when I needed counsel on my papers, however I disliked her lecture style and she was slightly rude to students who questioned her."
4682,2536607,1.0,5.0,Too many papers due week after week. It felt like this class lasted forever due to the busy work that was assigned &amp; the large amount of work assigned. Make sure to turn in everything timely as no late work is accepted (even a couple of hours late).
4683,2536607,4.0,5.0,"Ms. Kimbrell cares about her class and their grades. However, this class is a ton of work and bombarded with papers due pretty much every week. I never knew when it was going to slow down. Does give extra credit if you go to the writing center and very helpful if you go to office hours or email her. Isnt a tough grader for the papers as well."
4684,2536607,5.0,3.0,Ms. Kimberly is one of the best professors I have ever had in college. I had her for English comp 2 and she makes the class fun. Dont expect to get an Easy A or B from this class. Her assignments are moderate but you have to put a lot of time into them.
4685,2077865,2.0,5.0,"My hardest most frustrating class. To get an A/B on test, you MUST read every word of the horribly written and confusing textbook, even though she says you don't. Lectures can be interesting, but a COMPLETE waste of your time. Little extra credit, & weekly map quizzes. I taught myself all information. Would never recommend anyone to take her class."
4686,2167977,4.0,3.0,"Pay attention, take notes, and show up to class. Do that and you'll do well on the tests. Schedule meet ups, communicate with others, and don't wait to the last minute. Do that and you'll do well on the projects. He has dry humor which some people like- if he makes a joke at your expense he either wants you engaged or youre doing fine in the class"
4687,2634931,5.0,2.0,"I love Mr. Waite. He is very laid back. If you do not mind reading, then you'll be fine. There is a 33% chance of a reading quiz the first day of the week. I loved his lectures. Don't play on technology during class because he will take away the privilege of using it. He graded very clearly and allowed resubmissions. "
4688,2634931,5.0,3.0,He is a very chill professor that makes sure you understand the material no matter how much time it takes. I usually do not go to my classes but I have been to every single one of his classes this semester.
4689,2634931,3.0,5.0,"He was a cool and funny person, just didnt like writing a paper for a class every week"
4690,2634931,5.0,5.0,Work is hard but wants you to pass. Allows test corrections and accepts late work.
4691,2634931,5.0,3.0,"5-star professor simply because of how much he cares for students. I took him during spring of 2021, and he cancelled all classes during the week spring break would have been (COVID cancelled it) because he said he cared about our mental health. He is seriously a stand-up guy and goes the extra mile to help you learn the material."
4692,2634931,5.0,2.0,"Really good instructor. Make sure you read the chapter he assigns before coming to class, the book is not the best at explaining the topics but does give helpful examples. Go to lectures with questions. Logic is tricky, but he is really good at breaking the concepts down if you let him know where you are struggling. Super fair with grading."
4693,2634931,2.0,4.0,"Taught specifics well but not basics. Going to office hours did not help, lectures didn't help, and you either understood the book or you got zeros on the tests. The average final grade was 70, and other average test grades were in a similar range. The book is Forallx, read it and see if you understand it. If you don't you'll fail."
4694,2634931,5.0,2.0,"I loved Dr. Waite. He explained assignment requirements in-depth, respected his students, and genuinely wanted us to learn. You write 1 1/2 page papers on different philosophical theories and then have to rewrite them for the exams. If you dislike writing, the class is not for you, but he is a fair grader. I finished the class with 100."
4695,2634931,5.0,1.0,"Probably the most laid-back professor I've ever taken. Super chill, cares about his students and genuinely wants everyone to pass. He'll even talk about nerdy stuff with us in class. I definitely recommend him."
4696,2585786,5.0,4.0,"I really like her!! Her class is easy to follow, and her tests have clear study methods. Def would take her speech class!"
4697,2585786,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Lawrence genuinely cares about the subject and loves her students. She keeps 3 hour classes lighthearted and chill, but it is lecture heavy and a full class. She says you need the textbook but I dont recall ever using it. Homework is the preparation for speeches, and although it is a lot, if you dont cram, it isnt bad at all. Id recommend"
4698,2479291,5.0,1.0,Seriously such an easy class. She does a great job explaining all of the assignments and doesnt make the class unnecessarily difficult. The workload is kind of tedious but it is a computer class. Do the work and its an easy A
4699,1340640,1.0,5.0,"Makes mistakes on almost every problem, refuses to cover material the class doesn't understand that he has already taught. Most of the class is being tutored by someone or learning on their own."
4700,2667745,3.0,2.0,"Miss Berry is a new professor. Her lectures were not always interesting, but she was super sweet and wanted to interact with us. The grading mostly depended on your TA, but she made sure that everyone was treated fairly. We had 2 tests, a final project, and reading responses every week. Her teaching got better as she became more experienced!"
4701,1545456,1.5,5.0,"Dr. Doan is not a bad person. She is certainly very passionate about her subject material, and she seems to be exceedingly intelligent. Unfortunately, her tests are nearly incomprehensible, and you will probably learn more about her pet chickens than cognitive psychology. I went to class and studied and barely made it out of that class with a C."
4702,488693,5.0,4.0,I adored having Chris as a teacher. I had him for 2 seperate classes. He is the reason that I'm now a Criminal Justice major.
4703,488693,4.5,3.0,"Chris is an amazing teacher. He is challenging. Sometimes his tests don't follow the lectures but if he finds questions unfair, he will remove them (Has done so many times) I had him for 2 different classes. Great stories and will help in any way he can. Set up study sessions, helped me in his office, great man and teacher."
4704,488693,4.0,5.0,if you're looking for an easy A in Sociology... don't enroll in his class
4705,488693,5.0,3.0,awesome. very fun class to sit through. even if i didnt go to my 8 and 930 class i made sure i was at his at 11 cause i loved it so much... hes really funny and entertains while teaching.
4706,488693,5.0,3.0,"Very cool teacher, I recommend him to everybody!!!"
4707,488693,5.0,1.0,very easy and no attendance policy. will let you cheat on the exam and always has funny stories.
4708,488693,4.0,4.0,Pretty tough class. chris is great though. pretty funny and he will help you out.
4709,488693,3.5,2.0,"He was a pretty good teacher...just a grad student. Sometimes, the class was a little bit boring, but the material isn't always the most exciting thing, either..."
4710,2462974,1.0,5.0,"You have homework due once a week that's 7 pages of busy work. Nothing he says in class really matters everything comes from the book, but you have to go or you'll fail. You get none of the homework back or even graded, before the midterm. We've asked him what he wants for the essay questions but his answers are confusing. Made a fun class awful."
4711,685315,1.0,4.0,"The worst teacher I have ever had at MSU. Often rude and obviously puts minimal work into this class. Yet, she expects you to spend hours on her projects (THAT SHE GIVES LITTLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR) and pretty much teach for her. I am still unsure what I was supposed to learn in this class. Never have I seen a teacher be so demeaning towards others."
4712,685315,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Brocato is an amazing professor.  She can definitely be a little disorganized from time to time, but she actually allowed us to set deadlines for projects and things.  She has been incredible outside of class to write letters of recommendation when I needed them and offering encouragement when I needed it.  You won't regret taking her."
4713,685315,1.0,5.0,Very add-Ish. No point in taking the class except that its mandatory. She gives the same rubric for all 3 projects & gives no expectations or explanations except 'look at your rubric'. Extremely frustrating to not know what you'll need to do to get a good grade. The highlight of this class was when she made us massage each other as a reward. Crazy.
4714,685315,1.0,1.0,Very disorganized.  Learned nothing.  No Syllabus until week 4
4715,685315,2.5,1.0,"Uh, she's a little bit CRAZY, but I mean it in a good way..."
4716,685315,2.0,2.0,"Somewhat good, but not very helpful or interested in teaching"
4717,685322,1.5,2.0,"Total SNOT! If this were not the case, she would be a good teacher."
4718,685322,4.0,4.0,"She may come off as rude, but loves her job and makes sure you learn something useful"
4719,1201464,5.0,4.0,I loved Dr. Wolfe. I took everything I could take under him. He is extremely organized and very fair.
4720,1201467,4.0,5.0,"her tests are stupid hard. she gives study guides, but they arent very helpful at all. im not sure how anyone is supposed to do well in this class"
4721,1201467,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Pizer is a good teacher! Very passionate about what she teaches and willing to work with you. The content is hard but for the most part she explains it well. There were times when I felt confused, but that could have just been me personally. Overall, I actually liked this class!"
4722,1201467,5.0,3.0,"One of the best classes I've taken so far within the English/Linguistics department at State! Dr. Pizer is such an amazing teacher, and explains the subject matter very clearly while also making it super interesting. Some of the material was a little difficult, but nothing that was impossible."
4723,1201467,4.0,4.0,Pizer is a great lecturer on some days and finds a way to make relatively boring things more interesting. Sometimes it can make you fall asleep but the class discussion is what makes it enjoyable. She is easily accessible and gives great feedback on papers. I will take her for the rest of my linguistics classes but be aware that you have to WORK.
4724,1201467,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Pizer is a great teacher. She's very understanding and accessible. She's willing to help you if you ask, but you have to ask. Make sure you come to class and actually pay attention, and you'll be fine."
4725,1201467,3.0,4.0,"I found the class to be hard to focus on and the classes always seemed to drag. However, Dr. Pizer was a very clear teacher and if you studied the material and did the homework then you were good."
4726,1201467,5.0,3.0,"What could be a very difficult class is made much easier by Dr. Pizer's very clear and thorough lecture style. She moves through material fast, but she writes all the key definitions on the board, so it's generally not a problem. It was a fun class (moreso than I expected)."
4727,1201467,4.0,5.0,"VERY hard subject matter unless this is your concentration. A lot of material that is hard. Time consuming. Tests are very hard - lots of study. She explains the material but plan on getting extra help if this isn't your &quot;thing&quot; - However, she is more than willing to help and sincerely wants to see her students be successful. Extremely nice!"
4728,1201467,4.5,3.0,"It's easy if grammar is your thing, and hard if you aren't familiar with things such as passive voice or coordinating conjunctions, but she does explain it well."
4729,2078016,5.0,1.0,"This is a super easy class for Chem majors, albeit very boring. Fitzk we does always try to make it fun though. No tests, but several homework assignments and one group project at the end."
4730,2078016,3.5,3.0,Good teacher.  Nothing too hard or easy.  No need to buy the hard-copy textbook if you get the online Connect version.
4731,2078016,3.5,4.0,"The clarity of his lectures depend on the day, and he always lectures for the full class period.  If you need help, he is super helpful during office hours.  Not an easy class, but if you study hard and utilize the resources available an A can be gotten."
4732,2078016,4.0,3.0,Dr. Fitzkee's General Chemistry 1 class was not a bad class at all.  His notes are all online and he goes through/explains all of the slides in class. He has clicker questions and online homework (which is pretty hard compared to problems in notes). He is extremely nice and helpful! If you study his notes in advance then you will do fine on exams!
4733,2618688,1.0,1.0,"This lady is incapable of responding to emails in a timely manner. She is completely unable to be accessed, and this is a problem when she constantly assigns work with no explanation. This isn't a hard class by any means, but trying to stay sane during it was. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN AVOID IT"
4734,2618688,1.0,1.0,Very easy A+ but do not expect to learn anything valuable.
4735,2618688,5.0,5.0,"Mrs. Lineberry is one of the best teachers in a intro level class. You are required to take her ,yet she can be tedious with her grading. However, this is a easy A if you just do the work and do not procrastinate. These people who write horrible reviews do not understand how easy a course like this until your sophomore and junior year. "
4736,2618688,1.0,5.0,Would not recommend taking her class.
4737,2618688,1.0,5.0,She sucks!
4738,2618688,1.0,4.0,Do not take this teacher. Her grading is horrible and very dull. 
4739,2618688,1.0,4.0,Bad grading! Do not recommend this class!
4740,2618688,1.0,2.0,"Ms. Lineberry is hands down the worst professor/teacher I have ever had the misfortune of taking.
She is unclear on her expectations for assignments, group projects, quizzes, and exams.
Don't be surprised if you lose over 50% on assignments that you put maximum effort into.
Her rubrics are poorly written and unclear.
Do not take Ms. Lineberry!"
4741,2618688,1.0,5.0,Terrible teacher. Does not tell you what she wants on assignments then is a knit picky grader. I would never take any class taught by her again.
4742,2618688,1.0,2.0,This was possibly the worst class I've taken at MSU so far. There was a brief time where I really thought I'd end up with a B in an intro class. Assignments are vague and riddled with grammar errors that make everything hard to understand. Information given in this class is largely useless.
4743,2618688,1.0,3.0,"HORRIBLE. Her grading is bogus. She gives very little instruction on assignments and talks down to you like you were supposed to know exactly what she wanted, and takes off points for elements you included. Her ego is that of a 4 credit hour class. Attendance for her dreadful class is mandatory when she doesn't even teach."
4744,2618688,3.0,3.0,"most assignments were discussions she had SO MANY guest speakers its not even funny she rarely ever taught anything 2 quizzes, a final project, and a final exam she provided rubrics for her grading but it was still confusing"
4745,2618688,1.0,2.0,"Taking this professor was an utter waste of my time. Avoid her if possible. She continuously brought in guest speakers and hardly taught the course herself. Most of work was crammed into the last quarter of the semester. She is very picky about things, does not respond in a timely manner, and adds trick questions into easy quizzes."
4746,2618688,2.0,2.0,"This class felt so pointless. Assignments are insultingly easy, but her rubrics were often unclear and you could get points off for dumb things. The class felt very unorganized and half of the lectures were just guest speakers, which felt lazy on her part. Even when she did teach it was all over the place. If someone else is available take them."
4747,2618688,1.0,2.0,"It's a shame this course is required for Comp Sci majors. Professor Lineberry is very poor at describing what she expects from you in her assignments. Every description she gives is overbearingly vague. None of them are particularly hard, but it is immensely frustrating. If anyone else is available, take them instead."
4748,2618688,1.0,3.0,"This course is required for some. If there's another professor, take that one. The worst course and teacher I have had at MSU. The instructions for assignments didn't make any sense. She grades and nitpicks everything when the instructions are so broad. Many of the assignments were unnecessarily too much for a 1 credit class. Run!"
4749,2618688,1.0,4.0,Do not take her if you have the option. She is so nit picky about her grading and she does not even teach. She posts videos that other people have made to watch and do assignments from other websites. She turns a 1 hour credit course into what feels like a 5 with the amount of useless assignments she gives. The only good thing is extra credit.
4750,1357123,1.0,5.0,I had numerous instructors in the Dept. of Geosciences at MSU. He is by far the worst. Lectures in Quant. Techniques were boring and not helpful in doing the homework assignments. Exams didn't match up with what we were supposed to do for homeworks either. Super frustrating class to be taught online by someone who doesn't want to teach.
4751,1357123,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Mercer was a good teacher for Phys Met. He explains the material very well, and truly cares about helping his students. Make sure you study for the tests and quizzes often, and take time to do the HW, as it can be difficult at times. I would definitely recommend taking him for any meteorology class."
4752,1357123,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Mercer is truly an amazing professor. Synoptic meteorology is definitely tough, as it is a segue to upper level meteorology courses, but Mercer does a great job at explaining concepts. Super lenient on tests and homework, goes over tests after grading and handing them back. Hes also a close friend of Reed Timmer! Going to class will help a lot"
4753,1357123,5.0,5.0,"Synoptic is a challenging course, but Dr. Mercer truly cares about you understanding the material. I was initially intimidated by him due to his dry sense of humor, but he's actually very approachable and answers your questions. Just stop by his office and ask for clarification. Also, all his HW questions usually revolve around Star Wars."
4754,1357123,4.0,5.0,"Mercer is a little fast, but on tests and homework, he gives a lot of partial credit. Very accessible outside of class, and a great guy to talk to. Synoptic can be challenging, but he explains concepts well and makes the class interesting."
4755,1357123,5.0,4.0,"I had him for both Synoptic Meteorology and Stat Clim. He is a great lecturer, and very accessible outside of class. Stat Clim is an easy class if you pay attention in lecture. Synoptic Meteorology is hard, as expected. His homework is hard on the surface but work with others and you'll get through. Can't wait to have him for Physical Meteorology!"
4756,1357123,4.0,4.0,"Professor Mercer was great in this course. I needed lots of help and he was very accessible outside of class. Some things were confusing to me, but this was his first time offering the course online. You don't really use the textbook at all. Huge plus!--he gives you the notes to his lectures in PowerPoint presentations. This is a big help!!!"
4757,1357123,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Mercers lectures can be hard to follow sometimes, so be sure to  ask questions and don't be afraid to go to him during office hours. Tests are difficult, but he is incredibly generous with partial credit. Know Newton's 3 laws for the first test."
4758,1357123,2.0,3.0,This guy assumes we already know how to perform this kind of program and doesn't give good explanations as to why a certain code works in this situation and why another one doesn't. In the lecture he goes too fast and does the program for you without explaining what he did. He is also not that great at responding to emails.
4759,1357123,4.0,4.0,This required a good amount of work but not anything that was too overwhelming. Whenever I had a question (and I had alot) I always emailed him and he always replied back fairly quickly. He would give great feedback on your work in progress too.  I didn't really use the textbook but the lectures & powerpoints were essential to passing.  
4760,1357123,3.5,4.0,"Really hard class, but Dr. Mercer was always there to try and help. We moved really fast, and the explanations weren't always the best, but again, he's always there to help."
4761,1357123,3.5,4.0,"Really confusing at times, but really excited about teaching. He will help you until the sun comes up if you ask!"
4762,2643277,3.0,3.0,Good professor. Shes got a hard class to teach but she does a good job of making concepts easy to understand.
4763,2643277,4.0,3.0,"I had to withdraw from the course for personal reasons, however, I would take her again if I could take her in person. She had mostly quite decent lectures in which she simplified things very well. She was extremely good at getting students the help they needed. Unfortunately, she tended to not be very reachable through online means."
4764,2643277,4.0,2.0,"Good at explaining hard stuff. Keeps things as simple as possible, and gives tests that are like hw + extra credits galore. Hard to concentrate until she went to the whiteboard on cam, bc she has so much capacitanccce. Cons: A little disorganized - she was always having tech troubles and the asynch lectures had garbage audio and blank spots."
4765,2135381,1.0,4.0,"He has papers/quizzes based off the assigned modules that he's supposed teach in class, but rarely ever does in depth. He goes off on rants that gets the class off track, but you're still required to do the readings and assignments regardless. Papers aren't graded consistently. He never answers emails. This class is obviously not his priority."
4766,2135381,2.0,1.0,"The class is not hard at all but, the professor is bad. He is nice but never answers emails, always comes in late, has canceled class multiple times and counted the entire class absent, did not excuse my absence when I had a doctor's note, can barely read what he writes on the board and his class is just very boring. He also goes over every class."
4767,2135381,5.0,3.0,"Professor Banerjee got on my nerves at the start of the semester because I could never get into contact with him outside of class. As time went on I found out he was a really chill guy. Professor B is hysterical in class, even when he goes off on tangents about political matters we are not learning about. You are graded on 6 easy quizzes and papers"
4768,2135381,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Banerjee is funny and engaging in class! He tries to make the material relate to us. He likes to have fun in class and gave lots of attendance extra credit, which was a nice cushion for my grade now that finals are here. I would defiantly recommend Dr. Banerjee. He also sometimes moved class outside, which was nice to have some sun!"
4769,2135381,5.0,3.0,"Dr. B was a great professor to take! He only cares if you are actually retaining and learning the information and if you're not understanding something he'll help with no problems at all. Absolutely would love to take another class of his in the near future. If you want to take a funny professor with a passion for what he's teaching, he's your guy!"
4770,2135381,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Banarjee is my favorite professor I've ever had. I took the Honors section of his Comparative Politics course, and he is so passionate about the material. His class flies by because he makes his lectures fascinating and engaging. He assigned 3 papers, 6 pop quizzes, and a final that permitted open notes. I'd recommend him to everyone."
4771,2135381,5.0,1.0,Class is boring but he can be very funny and entertaining. Really understands college students if you know what I mean. I didn't use the text book and was fine. Midterm and final were open notes. Pop quizzes are really easy if you pay attention. Pop quizzes are your only attendance grade.
4772,2135381,4.0,4.0,I love Professor Banerjee but this class was a nightmare. I studied and studied and barely made it with my B. DO THE READINGS!! He's passionate about the subject but will easily loose you if you dont focus!
4773,2135381,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Banerjee might be the most interesting professor I have ever taken. He is extremely funny and very good at making his lectures relevant by tying them in to current events. He can be a little hard to follow at times because he gets off on tangents, but if you pay attention in class, show up for quizzes, and do the readings you will be fine."
4774,2135381,5.0,4.0,Great teacher. Going to class and participating is extremely important. He likes to get to know his students and help them so go and talk to him about tough assignments or the papers. Class has two test both allow the use of a double sided cheat sheet. There are 3 papers in the class and these are the most important part of the class.
4775,2135381,4.0,3.0,"Absolutely hilarious and really expects his classes to participate.  I was in the honors section of this class, and he loved us.  He even invited our class to dinner at the end of the semester.  He likes to joke around, but you can tell he really knows what he's talking about and wants the students to learn also.  3 papers and 7 pop quizzes"
4776,2135381,5.0,3.0,Banerjee is a great Professor. He will work with you always. He always comes to class with a smile on his face and ready to get to work. Being in his class feels like 5 minutes because he's so entertaining yet very informative.
4777,2610528,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Stampley is precious! I have taken two of her graduate-level classes, and have loved them both! I would take her over and over. She is so kind and really wants to see you do well. She grades easy, and NO tests online!"
4778,2610528,5.0,2.0,I took Ms. Stampley for Classroom Management. The course was extremely easy. I came out the course with a 100 average. Do the assignments and she'll give you credit for it. Definitely would take again.
4779,1922404,5.0,3.0,I love Dr. Ty! His lectures are interesting and class participation is involved to understand the material. The class material and assignments are through McGraw Hill. 
4780,1922404,3.0,2.0,Everything is due on Saturday so don't forget :) it'll bring your grade down a whole letter. don't waste time reading because you'll sit there for hours. class was weird tbh
4781,1922404,4.0,2.0,"I took Dr. Ty for two classes &amp; he is a great guy - he loves all of his students, and everyone can tell he loves what he does. His lectures are more like a conversation, which is nice for attention's sake but does mean class can get off-topic. Most of the homework and tests are through McGraw Hill Connect online. Great prof to get to know!"
4782,1922404,5.0,3.0,Dr. Ty is so funny. You either love him or hate him but I love him. He's probably the best professor I've had. His class discussions make the material relevant and funny and you can really tell he cares about his students. Take Dr. Ty at least once.
4783,1922404,4.0,2.0,"I LOVE Dr. Ty. However, his class not so much. I had him for Human Growth and Development. The class and assignments were fairly easy. I never saw a real purpose of going to his class because we never took notes. We just listened to him read from the book. A very boring class but other than that I was fine. He is a great professor and very funny!"
4784,1922404,5.0,2.0,I had Dr. Ty for Social Psychology. The class was easy and I enjoyed it a lot. I would definitely recommend Dr. Ty for any class. He is a really nice guy and he loves his students.
4785,1922404,5.0,3.0,"He genuinely loves and cares about all of his students. Personally, my grade was lower but that was on me, not him. Textbook is not mandatory but i STRONGLY advise it because my grades went up so much after I started outlining the chapters. His lectures are hilarious and I genuinely looked forward to going to his class every day."
4786,1922404,1.0,4.0,Horrible!! If you have a learning disability he won't allow you to take it at student support services! I took it in his office and that was horrible! He wouldn't even let my friend take it outside of his classroom! You should be prepared to study every weekend I had a test in that class every 2 weeks!! People either love him or dislike him
4787,1922404,1.0,4.0,I hated this professor and hate is a strong word. This professor is extremely condescending and not at all fair. I had to take his course twice and each time I was struggling and hated attending. His lectures don't match up to the tests which are set up for you to fail. It came down to my grade needing to be rounded .4% and he wouldn't. Fair where?
4788,1922404,5.0,4.0,"He is the best!! Be sure to go to every class & tests are kinda tricky, but his lectures are very interesting and hes a great guy!"
4789,1922404,1.0,4.0,"I would not recommend Dr. Ty to anyone. He's very condescending and does not go over the correct material from the chapters that will be on the test. He stresses the fact that he is &quot;extremely fair,&quot; which makes me think that he has gotten feedback stating he is definitely not fair from many students."
4790,1922404,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ty is probably one of the best professors I've ever had! He's so passionate about his course material and he explains it in a way for everyone to understand. However, majority of his test questions come from the book so read, read, read! He enjoys working with his students and discussing different ways to benefit their grade! 10/10 teacher."
4791,1922404,4.0,2.0,7 tests overall. Great lectures but dont rely on his slides. Read the textbook or youll only get 70s on your tests. He does random extra credit too and if you bring him a coffee hell probably give you some extra points.
4792,1922404,5.0,4.0,"He was puzzling at first, couldn't figure out if her was a softy or super strict. But at the end, best class I've ever taken. I respect that he's the same person inside and outside of class, and he is constantly informing his students of opportunities for study abroad and scholarships. I've gotten into several great programs thanks to him."
4793,1922404,2.0,4.0,"Spent lots of time studying in this class and the only time I was able to make an A on a test was when I got extra credit. I am a President's Scholar so this was frustrating. When I went to him to get tips on how to make better grades he was condescending and unhelpful, he insulted my grades and told me that I would not succeed in his class."
4794,1922404,4.0,3.0,I loved this class. He gives a test every other week but it wasn't that bad. He's really funny and delivers the lecture in an interesting way. He also gives extra credit and you scan in so its not really mandatory but he'll know if you skip. The tests aren't hard if you read the chapters before the test.
4795,1922404,4.5,2.0,Loved his Human Growth and Development class!!
4796,1922404,5.0,3.0,"I added this class because I was lacking hours- best decision I've ever made. Funny, straightforward, always keeps class going swiftly. BUY THE BOOK AS SOON AS YOU SIGN UP. You will need it practically every day in class. I didn't get the book by the first test, and luckily I didn't do too bad to be detrimental, but I read every chapter after that."
4797,2823564,1.0,4.0,"She uses words like sexy and things like that to describe our paintings. She constantly flirts with this male person in our class. When you ask her questions about what is wrong with the drawing, she does not answer it clearly. She constantly discourages my peers and me and I know people that have dropped majors because of her. DO NOT TAKE HER."
4798,2823564,1.0,4.0,She is literally the worst. She is very tough when grading when it is only Drawing 1 (a beginner class). It is hard to understand what she wants you to do and fix and is just rude. She threatened to give us a 20 hour project because some of us had to leave 10 minutes early. She is disrespectful and irrational with her grading. 
4799,2823564,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this professor, whatever you do! She makes everyone in our class very uncomfortable and does not respect anyone. Did not give clear feed back and accused almost everyone in the class of not doing the required outside of time class drawings. Very unfair in her grading and becomes very violent when you go to the bathroom."
4800,2635156,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Schmidt is great! She breaks up every big paper into smaller assignments, and this makes it surprisingly very easy and manageable. She is very understanding when grading, and she typically grades within a couple of weeks. I would highly recommend her!"
4801,2635156,4.0,2.0,This class was pretty easy but be prepared to write! There is lots of writing and researching because of your own papers along with peer reviews. Prof. Schmidt was very sweet and caring towards her students even though we had no interaction.
4802,2635156,5.0,3.0,"Had Mrs. Schmidt for Accel Comp II. Although I'm not fond of online classes, Mrs. Schmidt is very easy to work with. Her grading is reasonable, you just need to be willing to put in a little extra effort. Overall, I had a great experience with her as my English prof, just be sure to check on assignment due dates consistently!"
4803,2635156,5.0,4.0,"Super sweet professor! She's very open to listening and is very openminded to any mishaps that could happen throughout college. I had her for Accelerated Composition 2, and the workload was pretty consistent to where I would spend at least 3-4 hours per week, writing and working. You definitely have to put in the effort, but she is a fair grader!"
4804,2635156,5.0,3.0,Great teacher who engages with the students. She is a fair grader and cares what the students think. She wants to get the students involved in conversation and doesnt judge them for what they say.
4805,1234328,1.0,4.0,"By far one of the most poorly taught classes I've taken. Dr. Harland is extremely racist and sexist and makes these views very clear given the way he talks in class.  He rarely is on topic, class is exclusively his opinion, he grades maybe 1 or 2 assignments a semester and rarely ever actually speaks spanish.  Don't take if you're trying to learn."
4806,1234328,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Harland gives little to no effort to his class. He would constantly give random presentations/assignments that he would forget about the next class period, and he grades subjectively (no points, just a letter grade with no explanation.) He is also terrible at grading, halfway through the semester and I don't have a single grade in canvas. "
4807,1234328,1.0,4.0,"Literally the worst professor I've ever had. I've had no choice but to take him for three classes and all three were run horribly. He takes FOREVER to grade things, he makes inappropriate jokes. If you miss class more than once he will threaten to involve the dean but will show up late to class all the time, even today he was late by 35 min. Worst."
4808,1234328,1.0,3.0,"Robert Harland is not a teacher. He likes to hear himself speak. His class was an actual waste of time. The worst part is he does not grade any homework. I have taken quizzes, submitted paper outlines, and written essays, and he did not give any feedback or grades on anything. Grades were due today, and I still dont know my grade. Do not take him"
4809,1234328,2.0,3.0,"Racist and sexist. He really cares about his students, but he is also inappropriate. I wrote 5 papers but only got one graded and given back to me. If you're pretty and speak a good bit you'll get a good grade."
4810,1234328,1.0,2.0,"LOL. This class was such a joke. If you actually want to learn Spanish, know your grade in the class, or even know what's going on in general, DO NOT TAKE HIM. But if you don't really care and want an easy A, go for it. Just do your homework (which is a lot)"
4811,1234328,1.0,5.0,"Harland doesn't know or teach Spanish. In a Spanish 4 class, he teaches almost entirely in English. We barely spoke Spanish. There was no structure in his lectures, so that the only way to learn something was to read the book yourself. The WORST part is that grading is completely subjective, he literally tells you this in class."
4812,1234328,1.0,5.0,"He's absolutely one of the worst teachers I have ever had at Mississippi State. Unless you enjoy teaching yourself and being constantly ridiculed about how terrible your spanish is-DO NOT TAKE HIM. There's no reason as to why you get the grades he gives He doesn't know any names in a class of 30 If he can't make it, he brings in a sub."
4813,1234328,4.0,3.0,there's a lot of online homework but it isn't difficult. I took notes from the book every day before class and did fine on the tests. take this class with a friend because he liked to put us in groups of two or three and have us talk to each other in spanish. overall not a bad teacher!
4814,1234328,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Harland is such a great teacher. It takes a moment to get used to him because you can't tell if he's making a joke or not, but its easy to grow to  love him. He was super flexible with working with me an understanding the issues i had and giving good suggestions on how to handle them. He is extremely smart and will work with you if you try!"
4815,1234328,3.0,2.0,"He's a relatively funny guy and isn't too hard. If you are a decent student, he is a decent teacher. Homework is super easy and test aren't hard."
4816,1234328,3.5,4.0,No Comments
4817,2061737,2.0,4.0,"Ms. Voller's lectures are very dynamic, I enjoyed them very much but she grades way way way too harshly. Going to office hours didn't seem to help. I would not recommend taking her if you aren't willing to go above and beyond for this class."
4818,2061737,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Voller was by far the best teacher I've had. We wrote 3 analysis papers and a midterm and final. She makes this class very interesting. She gives so many resources to help you in your writing. Also, she holds office hours to help you with your papers. If you need this class, I can't think of a better person to take."
4819,2061737,5.0,4.0,"I took Ms. Voller for Intro to Literature online in a 5 week summer course (2 tests, 2 papers). There were plenty of assignments because the course was condensed, but everything we learned was very interesting. She also gives the best feedback on my papers that I ever received from an instructor. Extra credit is also easy and bumped me to an A!"
4820,2061737,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Voller is hands-down my favorite teacher! She truly cares about her students well-being. She makes literature fun for everyone, even people who dont like to read. We wrote 3 analysis papers and had a midterm test. The final was optional. She is a true gem, and I would recommend her to everyone!"
4821,2061737,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. V is probably one of my favorite professors Ive ever had at State. She genuinely wants to see you succeed, but shes not going to hand you anything. Tests are super easy, but she grades her papers really tough. Like... really tough (compared to others). Go to class, take good notes, and use her office hours. Youll be fine."
4822,2061737,5.0,2.0,Miss Voller made class so much fun. She really helps you on your papers and even has open office hours during class time whenever a paper is due. Take this teacher!
4823,2061737,5.0,3.0,"puts forth an effort to actually make the class interesting, accessible outside of classes, if you try she tries to help you"
4824,2061737,4.0,2.0,"A lot of the work in this class seems a bit pointless, but DO IT ANYWAY. The grades in this class are so easy. She is such an easy grader, so but in the slightest bit of effort and you'll do fine. It may seem like an annoying class, but she makes it interesting and it's so easy that it's worth it."
4825,2061737,4.0,2.0,"Ms. Voller is such a sweet lady. Overall, her class was not the bad. She is a lenient grader. There is a lot of work, but the work is so easy and it doesn't take long. I really enjoyed her class. She really tries to make to material interesting and cares about her class and students."
4826,2061737,5.0,3.0,super sweet lady. I enjoyed her class but she does assign a lot of work. but if you go to her office hours she will help a ton. she is so sweet and caring and can be funny! a great professor but you will have to do work in her class. she also keeps it interesting
4827,2061737,5.0,3.0,Amazing comp prof
4828,2061737,4.0,2.0,"As a science major, this was more reading and responding to literature than I cared for, but oh well.  She doesn't expect you to be a literature aficionado as long as you do your work.  She's very nice, but sometimes comes across with an ""I'm better than you"" attitude.  All of the essays and tests are graded super easily."
4829,2061737,5.0,4.0,"She was great. She always answered emails immediately and made everything easier to understand. Lots of papers, but it is an English class."
4830,1357240,5.0,5.0,Dr. Campbell has many resources and plenty of availability for any student that needs extra help! Clear and concise lectures with homework that helps you if youre struggling.
4831,1357240,5.0,3.0,I took Dr. Campbell for Drug use and Abuse and it was my favorite class of the semester. The lectures were always very interesting and she would make them fun. I really recommend her as a teacher!!!!! 
4832,1357240,5.0,2.0,"Open note tests, however they are timed. If you don't know what you are doing, you won't finish the tests. Lots of hw on MindTap which was weird and kind of a waste of money, but not difficult. Dr. Campbell is amazing and super approachable after of class and even outside of class. This is my 2nd class with her and she remembered who I was :)"
4833,1357240,5.0,3.0,Dr. Campbell has been my favorite teacher so far at MSU. Shes very specific and easy to understand. If you go to class and actually read through the textbook you will pass stats easily.
4834,1357240,5.0,4.0,"I have never in my life had sooo much work!! There is no extra credit and the course is pretty difficult. BUT, I must say that Dr. Campbell is BEYOND empathetic and patient. She definitely wants her students to succeed. She is also very flexible &amp; understanding. If you simply communicate with her, she will do what she can to accommodate you."
4835,1357240,5.0,2.0,"Took Drug Use and Abuse. Very kind, made sure to learn the names of those that attended regularly. Knows her stuff, and is passionate about it. Assignments open book/notes. I used an old, online edition of the textbook and had no issues from that. Class is mostly lecture, maybe some small class participation. All slides posted to canvas."
4836,1357240,4.0,4.0,"I took Stats in the summer and I can't recommend because the class is extremely rushed and I felt as though the grades were hit or miss at times instead of a slow improvement. That being said, Dr. Campbell is always available to meet and is very kind. There are no TAs and a ton of work. Only take it if you have the time to work on it daily."
4837,1357240,5.0,3.0,"I loved this class. There is a lot of homework but none of it is hard as long as you go to class and do the lecture worksheets and quizzes. Her tests are pretty easy as well, I definitely recommend doing the practice problems though and having them with you as you take it. Het tests are open note. Her lectures are entertaining and she is super nice"
4838,1357240,5.0,2.0,Dr. Campbell is a wonderful professor! I took her for Drug use and Abuse and she made the class very interesting and fun. She posts all her slides and makes it very convenient to go back and study. She is also good at answering questions. The textbook is required and definitely helpful to get a more in-depth understanding of the material.
4839,1357240,5.0,4.0,Dr. Campbell is a very nice person. She is definitely very professional and cut and dry when it comes to grades. Her TAs were great this last semester but make sure you keep up with due dates. I'd highly recommend taking her for Psych Stats. The tests were online and reflected the course material. Just do what's expected and you should be fine!
4840,1357240,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I have had at MSU. Her lecture and lab videos are very specific, if you follow them you will not fail that portion. Her tests can be difficult but not if you review the material. She will help you if you ask and the TA's will too. 100% would take again she was so helpful."
4841,1357240,5.0,2.0,"Great professor! She does have lots of little assignments that add up, so it is important not to miss them. Her tests are easy if you write down everything she says in lecture."
4842,1357240,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Campbell's lectures are so easy to listen to, that it feels like you don't even need to take notes if you just listen in class and pay attention. You can tell she's passionate about her work and it makes the class super interesting, I loved her. She pulls maybe 2 questions each test from the book so you don't really need it. Weekly quizzes."
4843,1357240,5.0,3.0,"She is very knowledgeable and she gives interesting lectures. There is a quiz due every week , the tests are hard if you dont study but she gives a lot of extra credit opportunities"
4844,1357240,3.0,4.0,Dr. Campbell is interesting to say the least. She is awkward. Lecture is boring! Most times she read from the slides. Attendance does not count unless it is a show and tell day. Her tests covers a lot of material and it very wordy until the point it can be confusing. I took the class as a required elective and it is certainly not an elective.
4845,1357240,5.0,4.0,"She is an amazing professor! She gives you absolutely everything you need to know without the use of an expensive textbook. She posts all the lecture powerpoints on myCourses. It is almost impossible to fail if you know basic Algebra. She offers extra credit, and her lectures are interesting because she is eccentric."
4846,1357240,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Campbell is very nice, but she can be kind of intense at times. She isn't the best at answering questions. and there were a few times that her ""explanation"" just confused us even more. Her tests are very thorough, so expect to take the time time to do the test. For example, her final almost took me three hours to complete. She cares though!!"
4847,1357240,5.0,2.0,"She is fun and entertaining and very knowledgeable, will easily clear up any questions you have. You don't need the book if you take Psychological Statistics with her. Expect a LOT of long homeworks, but they help you really understand the material so there's not much other studying to do outside of class. Labs are very long at the end of semester."
4848,1357240,4.5,3.0,Be prepared for lonnnngggggggg labs and homework
4849,1357240,5.0,2.0,Had Dr. Campbell for Psych Stats and she is AWESOME. Best teacher ever! She explains everything so well and makes math fun. 
4850,1357240,5.0,2.0,"Campbell is AWESOME! She makes class so fun and interesting. Don't buy the book! Just take notes in class and take extra notes on things she spends extra time on. She will ask you to identify people by their pictures so pay attention to those. Also, she hates people that try to sneak in or out of class."
4851,1357240,5.0,2.0,She is great! Had her for honors general psychology.
4852,1357240,4.5,3.0,"Took her Drug Use and Abuse class-- even for a Maymester course, she gets the information across successfully, and she is helpful. The other post isn't accurate really-- she talks about the notes perfectly, but she expects you to read as well.  You do need the book, she takes quiz questions from it. Just pay attention, and you've got no problems."
4853,1357240,1.0,5.0,"One of the worst profs I've ever had. She printed and passed out notes, but the notes had nothing to do with the test. She also &quot;talked about the notes&quot;, but what she talked about had nothing to do with the notes or test. I only passed b/c of a paper. She teaches nothing having to do with her tests."
4854,1357240,5.0,3.0,"I loved Mrs. Campbell.  She prints off all her notes and gives them to you before she lectures.  Her class is not an easy A, but she is very clear on what will get you an A.  She does a lot of group discussions so it's pretty interesting."
4855,1357240,3.5,3.0,"She's an interesting teacher. She tends to ramble a lot, and definitely takes up the whole time. The tests are actually harder than you originally expect, but if you just take the online quizzes on the textbook website, you should be fine."
4856,1316283,4.0,4.0,Excellent Digital Systems Course that utilizes Verilog and Xilinx FPGA Spartan Chip
4857,1357245,3.0,3.0,"Almost impossible to contact outside of the classroom. If you disagree with his opinions on a paper, you will receive a low grade even if it is the best paper you have ever written. If possible take someone else."
4858,1357245,1.0,1.0,"Avoid him like the plague(he's probably worse). He spends 90% of the time talking about politics. No part of this class is creative. If you don't write about the topics he suggests you can kiss an A goodbye. Don't take him for an easy a: daily quizzes, readings every night, reads work out loud to entire class, makes rude comments about work, etc."
4859,1357245,4.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Lyons for creative writing, EN 3303. While I had to work hard, his class really helped sharpen my skills as a writer. He gave me honest feedback and helped me find solutions to problems in my writing. He also encouraged me to continue my writing. I would definitely recommend him to anyone who is serious about their writing."
4860,1357245,5.0,4.0,"Good creative writing teacher. He doesn't censor but will give honest feedback if whatever you write is really dumb. Still, he helps students find potential in their work and grades fairly."
4861,1357245,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Lyons was one of my favorite teachers at MSU. As an English major, I sharpened my writing skills with his help. He is exellent for that reason. He enjoys colorful language, so he isn't for the delicate. "
4862,1357245,2.0,4.0,"He is the type of character you would think of if you thought of an English professor. His classes are pretty boring and he's one of the type that believes ""it's my way or the highway"" so he doesn't really accept any opinions on the books except his. But he's pretty forgiving on the papers so if you talk to him, he'll help you out."
4863,1357245,3.5,2.0,"He is really helpful, and if your class is small enogh, he will let you rewrite your papers. Sometimes he rambles, but his rambling is funny and he has been to a lot of places. Overall, it is a really fun class to take and it's not hard if you put some effort into it."
4864,1816000,2.5,1.0,It was aight
4865,1816000,3.5,3.0,"He is clear on the criteria. There are only 100 points possible in the entire class to make it easy to track your grade, and there is this one extra credit assignment that has to do with babies, and it is worth 10 points, so if you do that assignment, it will raise your grade by a lot! Discussion boards on mondays, and post tests on fridays"
4866,1816000,3.5,2.0,"He is a very sassy person if you have a question or if you answer one of his questions wrong. He usually makes you feel stupid. However, the class is easy if you just do the work and show up. "
4867,1816000,2.0,3.0,He's an okay teacher but he is super biased about some things and is not very willing to help you out. Attendance isn't mandatory but it does help going because he does give a fair amount of extra credit. The class isn't all that hard it just focuses a lot of topics that don't seem like they should relate to the class. I wouldn't recommend him
4868,1816000,5.0,1.0,Great teacher. Very helpful outside of class. What I liked the most is that finals are optional. You'll get the chance to take each test over at the end of the semester. Attendance is not mandatory but it is helpful to come to class because extra credit is spontaneously given. Overall he's HIGHLY recommended to students.
4869,2274752,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wood truly made Satellite Met fun for her students. She is super nice and you can tell she is very passionate about the subject, which adds to her knowledge on it as well. The labs aren't too difficult, and neither are the quizzes. Be prepared to have SIFT slow down your computer, however. I would definitely recommend taking her."
4870,2274752,4.0,3.0,"Can be tough grading at times, but show up and take decent notes and you'll be fine. Some very basic math and physics knowledge is necessary as well. Professor cares about your grade and is accessible outside of class."
4871,1652162,5.0,3.0,I absolutely adore Dr. Spain. She shows so much care and respect to the art of film and works very hard to pass that love onto her students. All discussions are always extremely insightful and aide in better understanding the course materials. 
4872,1652162,3.0,4.0,"I took her Intro to Film class this semester and it wasn't quite what I expected. You do get a general look at film and all of its components but it is heavily focused on film theory. Every week we have 2 assignments which aren't very hard but very often the questions are very vauge. For your assignments, you have to be very specific! "
4873,1652162,1.0,5.0,"This teacher made me hate a course i had been looking forward to taking for the last 3 years. She is unreasonable, unenjoyable and unlikeable. In her class you would think youre at a prestigious film school in your last year. Awful."
4874,1652162,2.0,4.0,"This professor starts teaching before the class time even begins and teaches past the ending time. She is passive, and she is picky with when you can have your laptop out or not. I didnt enjoy her because of how much time she took. going over every class and starting 10 minutes early is very inconvenient when u have other classes."
4875,1652162,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Spain's class Intro to Film was tough, absolutely a lot of work and definitely no room to miss a class/assignment. However, i loved it! she knows what shes talking about and shes passionate about her work. Shes a very nice woman and is always available to help, but you HAVE to do the readings."
4876,1652162,4.0,5.0,"Spain is just one of those professors you gotta roll with. She's a tough one but shes extremely respected by staff and is a good rec letter. People complain a lot about her but honestly if you TRY to read most of the stuff and ALWAYS come to class and SOMETIMES talk in class, you'll probably do better than a C"
4877,1652162,5.0,4.0,"The class was super challenging, but in a great way. Dr. Spain opened my mind about filmmaking and philosophy. I've always been interested in film, but now I can talk about technical film terms. She makes us think about what it means to be behind camera, and we got to make our own films! She also gives tons of extra credit."
4878,1652162,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Spain will assign unrealistic amounts of reading. Even if you do all of the reading and work really hard on papers, you still run the risk of being accused of plagiarism. She does this a lot. She prides herself on her first day of class saying she has a special talent for spotting plagiarism. Her train of thought it very hard to follow."
4879,1652162,2.0,4.0,I took Dr. Spain for intro to film and it was not as all what I expected. It was more film theory than anything which was not what the course was advertised as. She's extremely harsh with grading if you aren't a good writer and her tests require you to write out everything. Not to mention she's arrogant and rude to students who ask questions.
4880,1652162,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Spain is the best English professor on campus. I don't care what anyone says about her- If you didn't like her, you didn't get to know her. The material we read was extremely interesting and class discussion was always productive, even in times of COVID. Don't let other students steer you away from her as I did, take her class! She truly cares."
4881,1652162,1.0,5.0,Please avoid this woman at all costs. I still cannot fathom her thinking. She is incredibly rude and mean. The readings are at least 40-50 pages long and expects you to print them out and bring to class on a college budget. I had to withdraw from the semester because she caused me so much stress. She talks in circles and can never make a point.
4882,1652162,1.0,5.0,"She is passionate about her subject area, but her style of teaching and her &quot;lectures&quot; are so scattered and disorganized that it's incredibly difficult to follow along. She is condescending, but she does push you to think for yourself. She has A LOT of room for improvement. If you take her READ EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. Harsh grader."
4883,1652162,2.0,5.0,"I had Dr. Spain for an honors seminar, which I expected to be hard, but she made it unbearable. She talked in circles & never really made a point, and when I tried to get help on my papers she was vague and never gave me any direct or constructive feedback. I walked out of class every day feeling like I had no idea what she had just talked about."
4884,1652162,1.0,5.0,"I typed the review that came just before this one. Ironically, my last one seems scatterbrained due to how many characters I was given to comment. But I assure you, she'll make you consider why you're in the English major. Idk why she wouldn't provide me with proper help. I reached out to her several times, and every time it was rushed and vague."
4885,1652162,5.0,4.0,"I had Dr. Spain for Women and Lit and this course was without doubt the most amazing course I have taken in all my years of schooling. If you are looking for an easy grade and you are not a hard-worker, she is not for you. She will challenge you. She will make you think and ask questions and discuss and engage."
4886,1652162,3.0,4.0,"She's not easy. AT ALL. Be ready to read a lot, fail a lot of quizzes (reading quizzes ask for the strangest smallest details possible), and papers and tests are so-so. I've had to take her multiple times and it is definitely stressful."
4887,1652162,1.0,5.0,"The reading is impossible, with twenty-ish pages per class meeting. Plus you have to print it out. She almost always lectures past time. She literally stomps her feet and has temper tantrums. The tests are really hard, even if you study. The papers are really time consuming (esp. with 5 other classes) She repeats herself in lieu of clarifying."
4888,1652162,2.0,4.0,I asked her about her grading on my papers and quizzes and she not only didn't answer my question but also made me feel even worse about myself in the process. The reading is also a doozy with 20+ pages to print every day and not bringing reading to class means you're absent for the day. One of the toughestmost stressful classes I've taken yet.
4889,1652162,5.0,3.0,"She is a wonderful teacher. You HAVE to bring the assigned texts to class, and there were weekly quizzes and papers, but the class is not overwhelming and very enjoyable."
4890,1652162,5.0,4.0,Dr. Spain was a phenomenal teacher!  She has high expectations for her students but not unrealistic ones.  She is a superb lecturer and I would highly recommend her to anyone who is interested in an engaging and thought-provoking classroom experience.
4891,2659779,5.0,2.0,If you need an easy humanities elective this is the class to take with McDill. His lectures keep you so engaged and interested in the class material. Overall this class was super easy and so educational.
4892,2659779,5.0,3.0,Very amazing professor. Lectures are done through Kahoot so they're engaging. 10/10 recommend!!!!
4893,2659779,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely awesome professor! Lectures are very engaging (mine were on Kahoot), and super interesting. Mr. McDill does a fantastic job, and I would recommend his class to anyone! Learned a lot and loved coming to class!"
4894,2094535,5.0,4.0,"He is a great professor, he helps everyone the best he could. He wants to see everyone succeed."
4895,2094535,5.0,3.0,super chill dude and amazing teacher
4896,2094535,4.5,3.0,Great teacher. Utilizes the short time you have in his class. Definitely would take him again.
4897,2553296,3.0,3.0,"I started off on the wrong foot in this class, but still managed to make an A with extra credit and drop grades. She talks very quietly, so it is hard to understand her; however, she is very smart. Typically easy math, but it gets harder sometimes."
4898,2553296,1.0,4.0,horrible. boring and cant understand a word she says. no idea what she is teaching either
4899,1832405,5.0,1.0,"I really appreciate his lectures and mentoring student to build up their life and career. He is an intelligent person and contains a vast of knowledge regarding geographic information system(GIS), Remote sensing(RS), and other natural sciences. I wish him good luck in his academic career life and flourishing society as a mentor!"
4900,1832405,4.5,3.0,Dr. Meng was extremely encouraging to students and expressed a strong desire to help them master the subject matter (python programming).  His lectures were to the point and lab assignments were geared to producing practical GIS skills.  He was available outside of class and offered 1-on-1 help.  Exams could perhaps be improved a bit for clarity.
4901,1832405,5.0,2.0,He is very knowledgeable and tries to help with what he can. Not an easy class but very interesting. A nice professor.
4902,1832405,5.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed the class. I had no prior knowledge of programming, but came out knowing a good bit. The labs were helpful, as was Dr. Meng."
4903,1832405,3.0,3.0,"He is sometimes hard to understand, but he always tries to help the best that he can. I found that you learn more in his lab other than his lecture. He appreciates when you ask questions during class. Very helpful outside of class and always has a smile on his face."
4904,1832405,5.0,1.0,"Awesome teacher, very easy and very helpful in and out of class."
4905,1832405,3.5,1.0,Great class. Dr. Meng provides the material and lenience to allow a student to learn and succeed in his class.
4906,1832405,5.0,2.0,Was very helpful and answer all questions that I had. Would strongly recommend him to any one else!!!!
4907,1832405,3.5,1.0,"I thought that Dr. Meng's Programming class was helpful. It is a difficult topic and not always easy to understand, but he provides the material and is lenient toward mistakes and misinterpretations. I'd suggest Dr. Meng as an instructor for the python GIS class."
4908,1832405,1.0,3.0,"Dr Deva. He was very nice until you asked questions or challenged him. Basically, he throws a bunch of code at you and says figure it out. He gives very little direction and if he gives any, it is unclear. His final project (30%?) was an example of some code and the instruction ""make a project"". If you asked questions, he avoided them."
4909,2651607,3.0,1.0,"COVID moved this class online so it was easy b/c he allowed you to look at the book for all the quizzes, and the test questions were exactly quiz questions. Annoying because often the topic of a quiz question wasn't in the book (even in glossary), or not in the chapters assigned to read. I contacted him about this; he didn't seem too concerned."
4910,1021401,5.0,2.0,"What a guy and what an experience. Banik sure does keep you entertained with random stories and comments. Aside from that, Banik is a great guy that makes DE about as good as it gets. He goes pretty fast in lectures so you may get lost every now and then. There wasn't too much hwk and he outlines what to expect for each test very nicely. "
4911,1021401,5.0,3.0,This professor was on whole another level. LEGEND!
4912,1021401,5.0,2.0,Absolute legend.
4913,1021401,4.0,3.0,Banik was a pretty cool teacher. I took a 5 week trigonometry course. Beware of his funny stories and dad jokes!
4914,1021401,5.0,3.0,I feel prepared for my future math classes. Clear explanations on topics. Fair tests. Test questions were very similar to problems on WebAssign homework. Quick grader. Provided blank lecture notes on Canvas. Only professor of mine to accept an absence excuse for a required university event.
4915,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Really fun professor!  He also teaches very well, and is great about giving partial credit on tests."
4916,1021401,5.0,5.0,Banik works decently fast through practice problems and can be hard to follow sometimes but he will always stop if you have a question. Responds to emails fast and will send you notes if you happen to miss class. Tests are similar to practice problems done in class. My favorite professor at state so far. 
4917,1021401,5.0,5.0,This guy is great. Puts effort into teaching and is good at it. Tries to make the class interesting. I hate the material but he makes it bearable!
4918,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Loves class engagement and will spend 10% of almost every class talking with students, if he likes the class. Ask him how high he can jump. As a bonus, he does a great job of teaching at a level that is both interesting to advanced math students and accessible to those who struggle with math."
4919,1021401,5.0,4.0,One of the best teachers I've ever had.
4920,1021401,5.0,2.0,"As long as you show up to class and study for tests, you will get an A. Mr. Banik does not try to trick you, and he gives a clear test outline for each test. Homework is also a large portion of the grade, and he is always available for help."
4921,1021401,5.0,3.0,Legendary professor. Take if you need DE.
4922,1021401,5.0,4.0,"The class is hard but he gives good lectures and notes and is pretty approachable. I made a C because I didn't study enough for the final, but if you put in enough time and effort, this class could definitely be an A. I would definitely take him for any math course."
4923,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Banik is a funny and great guy that works to make sure you understand the material. He is good about letting you know exactly what to expect on the tests and if you do only the homework to study, you can easily pass with a B. His test problems are definitely harder than the classwork and the final is difficult (no hints on how to solve)."
4924,1021401,5.0,4.0,"Banik is a fantastic DE professor and would do great in Calculus II (which I hear he is teaching in Spring of 2022 / Fall 2022). Hes a great guy, really funny, and has some good stories. DE itself is not fun, be prepared to practice a lot of problems to do well, but hes very clear about what you should look for and how to go about the problems."
4925,1021401,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Banik is easily the best instructor I've had thus far at Mississippi State. I had him for DE, and would most assuredly take any class of his again. If you want a math course to make sense, and be relatively easy, take Banik. The material is still somewhat difficult, but Banik makes it easily workable."
4926,1021401,5.0,4.0,Banik is amazing! He really just wants you to succeed. He will do anything to help you!!!! Best math professor at msstate. Take him!
4927,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Best prof at MSU. Tests are just like the review. Had him for Cal 1, 2, and DE and wish I could take more classes like that. He actually made all of those classes enjoyable. You definitely have to study for the grades, but he tells you what to study."
4928,1021401,5.0,4.0,Great and respected teacher. Cracks jokes in class. Youll love him for DE. Do the homework and go to class and youll do good.
4929,1021401,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Banik is a great DE teacher and is always willing to help, I just suck at math which is why I got a C. Recommend him to anyone taking DE. Homework counts a lot in the class so if you do it you have some grade shielding"
4930,1021401,5.0,4.0,"Banik is the best prof. at State. The downside to DE is that your grade relies heavily on your exams &amp; is graded holistically. You have to not make any math mistakes including calc, algebra, &amp; trig in order to get an A. I am currently trying to bring my B up to an A with the final. He rounds up 89's and the final replaces your lowest."
4931,1021401,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Banik knows the material very well and can explain it in a way that often makes since to an average student with a strong calculus background. Homework is usually close enough to the lecture where you can do it if you paid attention. Also, he can return tests faster than any teacher I've ever had, finishing my section in about three hours."
4932,1021401,5.0,2.0,Professor Banik is a really good teacher and the problems on the test can be directly traced back to a problem from the lecture notes and also multiple hw problems. he is very air with partial credit he is also a nice guy too.
4933,1021401,1.0,4.0,Puts bizarre problems on the test. 2/3 of the class doesnt even finish in time
4934,1021401,1.0,5.0,The stuff he puts on the test in not even related to the stuff he works in class
4935,1021401,5.0,2.0,"If I could have this man as my teacher every semester, I would. Conveyed the material extremely well. His personality makes his jokes funny. Overall enjoyable person to be in class with. Easy to talk to after/outside of class. Generous grader. Easy transition online for COVID. Material is paced out well. Similar test questions to notes/homework."
4936,1021401,5.0,3.0,Mr. Banik is an awesome teacher. His lectures come from the homework (or vice versa) which helps when you get stuck. He always shows that he cares about teaching and is pretty hilarious.
4937,1021401,4.0,3.0,He does a good job explaining and breaking down the problems in DE. Tests were fair and similar to the review but did require you to fully understand the material. Lectures were fun as he often told stories and jokes along with teaching. Overall would recommend for Differential Equations.
4938,1021401,3.0,5.0,"Banik was a great teacher for Diff Equations. I struggled mightily in this class, however, but not due to his teaching style. He explains things very well, but beware of his tests. Study very hard for them, as that's what ended up costing me in the end. Also, make sure to practice A LOT of problems, because this material does take time to learn."
4939,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Professor Banik was awesome. He truly cared about his students and their understanding of the material. Tests are very similar to the homework problems and the quizzes. Super nice and funny guy, would absolutely take him again."
4940,1021401,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Banik is fantastic! He has great stories and interesting facts, and he's hilarious. He made class super enjoyable."
4941,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Banik is a great teacher and he teaches up to Cal 4. He posts his slides online, the blank ones before and the worked ones after. The homework is extremely similar to the classwork. He tells you exactly what will be on the test."
4942,1021401,5.0,3.0,"A professor that is passionate about the subject he teaches (or at least pretends to be). Seems to care about his students. Class material is not easy, but it is very straight-forward."
4943,1021401,5.0,4.0,Great teacher. 10/10 would take again
4944,1021401,5.0,4.0,Makes lecture less boring and is clear about what you need to know for tests
4945,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Cal 1 with Banik was a great class! His lectures move fast sometimes, but other times he will take time to tell one of his many humorous stories. Tests are basically laid out for you a the class before the test. If you have no previous experience with calculus in high school you will be fine; however, if you took calculus in high school don't slack"
4946,1021401,4.0,4.0,"Very good math teacher. If you do not understand something, he makes sure you understand if you attend his office hours.  Study for tests because there is only 4, and do the homework because it could pull you up a letter grade. You'll love going to lecture because he has the craziest stories."
4947,1021401,4.0,4.0,You literally dont have to go to this class if you know how to do calculus. He posts all of his in class notes online. Easy A for HW assignments. Tests are tough. Speaks really good english.
4948,1021401,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher. Never been that great at math, but he made understanding anti-differentiation and all the other foreign sounding topics, super easy. Awesome class; he's funny so its not like a monotonous lecture like some of the other professors. i took him for Cal I, great class. would highly recommend."
4949,1021401,4.0,4.0,Do your work. Stay engaged. Actually do your homework instead of guessing for the 99 chances he gives. Be respectful. If you do these things and come after class with questions he will try to help you.
4950,1021401,2.0,5.0,Not as good as everybody makes him out to be. Class is very TEST HEAVY so if you mess up on any of the 3 test thats just your luck trying to bring it up because homework grade helps none. No extra credit. I personally wouldn't recommend. Just being honest.
4951,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Banik is very approachable and just generally easy to understand, explaining everything in detail, posting it all online, and later referring to it as ""magic."""
4952,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Banik is a great guy. He's very interesting as a person, and this carries over into his lectures.  He works several example problems that are identical to the ones on the exams, so if you pay attention in lecture, the tests are fairly easy.  I'd definitely recommend taking him if you have the choice."
4953,1021401,3.5,4.0,Tells stories and keeps you engaged. Offered extra credit
4954,1021401,5.0,4.0,"Absolutely outstanding in every sense of the word. If you are required to take any course in the Calculus series and Robert Banik is being offered as a choice of professor for that course, waste no time in signing up for him. His classes are in very high demand for very good reasons. Strongly recommended."
4955,1021401,5.0,2.0,"Great Teacher! Had him for Cal 2 and 3, wouldn't change it for a thing. If you go to class and do your homework you will be fine. He will help you out if your just short of the grade you need!"
4956,1021401,4.0,4.0,He was ok. I think he definitely has favorites in the class.
4957,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Banik is just a really funny, down-to-earth guy in his 20s and has a one-liner humor that comes out of nowhere and can be half-dark sometimes.  His teaching is to the point and comprehensive as he does not waste your time explaining things you don't need."
4958,1021401,4.0,3.0,"LOVED Banik. Great teacher, explains things well. I had taken AP Calculus in high school, so it was review for me, but he still seemed like an awesome teacher even if it is your first time in Cal. I'm taking him for Cal II as well. "
4959,1021401,4.5,2.0,Absolutely hilarious and makes going to class enjoyable.  He explains things really well and is willing to help anyone.  Absolutely 100% recommend.  
4960,1021401,5.0,1.0,He's a good teacher. Had an awesome SI that was more than willing to help & work with your schedule. He's absolutely hilarious and simplifies things for easy learning.  The only reason I bought the text book was for the online portion for WebAssign but other than that the only thing you use the book for is extra practice. Posts written notes online
4961,1021401,5.0,3.0,You rock doc
4962,1021401,4.5,3.0,"Even though the material is extremely difficult, Banik works really hard to make sure everyone gets it. He cracks jokes and tries to make class more interesting. Everyone should still go to class because attendance is now part of your grade, and it helps because he always tells you what questions will be on the test"
4963,1021401,4.0,2.0,His class was easy to follow along with.  Posts power points with both the blank and worked notes. 
4964,1021401,4.0,3.0,"Best calculus teacher I've ever had. I would recommend him to anyone. If you don't understand, he elaborates very well. "
4965,1021401,4.5,1.0,"Be ready to buy an expensive textbook or code to submit homework, and clicker"
4966,1021401,2.5,4.0,"Banik is funny and a good professor, he just doesn't necessarily take the time to slow down and explain things, it is a lot of learning on your own. Test are difficult, but based completely off notes. "
4967,1021401,5.0,2.0,He is funny and makes class extremely interesting.
4968,1021401,3.5,4.0,"Cal 1. Good teacher but he likes to throw curveballs on the tests. If you pay attention in class tho, it's not too bad. He posts all the notes online so if you miss a day, it's not a big deal but I would still recommend going to class because you might not understand it when doing the homework. The textbook is not helpful at all, very confusing."
4969,1021401,5.0,1.0,"Very funny, relatable.  Teaches what you need to know, nothing unnecessary.  Gives homework, takes attendance, bonus questions on clicker.  Puts notes online. All around great teacher!"
4970,1021401,5.0,1.0,"He is such a great teacher! His tests are simple and straight forward. The online homework is brief, and he drops 3 of your lowest grades at the end of the semester. I highly recommend him for cal 1!"
4971,1021401,5.0,1.0,Great teacher. Passionate about math & easy.
4972,1021401,4.5,1.0,Really great teacher and person! helps you understand the lectures and makes class entertaining
4973,1021401,5.0,1.0,"This class is an easy A. The quizzes and tests are done outside of class online, and are exactly like the notes. The homework is also online and easy. At the end of the semester, you get at least 3 drop homeworks and 3 drop quizzes. He also replaces your lowest test with your exam if it's better. Extra credit is also given."
4974,1021401,5.0,1.0,"Loved him! Explained the subject well, and I am terrible at math. Taking him again for Business Cal."
4975,1021401,5.0,1.0,"The homework & quizzes are done online, but the tests are done in class. So far, all of the tests have been around 20-30 questions. It's best to attend all classes b/c it's easier to understand when he teaches it. He seems to enjoy teaching and is always in a great mood. He likes to crack jokes (which can be corny sometimes but he's still funny)."
4976,1021401,5.0,2.0,He was awesome.  Kind of one of my favourite teachers ever.
4977,1021401,5.0,2.0,"He was so great! I'll definitely take him again, he was incredibly helpful and loves what he does"
4978,1021401,5.0,1.0,Explains the subject really well
4979,1021401,5.0,1.0,Great teacher would recommend to anyone.
4980,1021401,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher! Fun personality! I would recommend going to class. The days that I missed, I struggled through homework. Everything is done online, exams, quiz, & homework. I'm taking him for Trig next semester."
4981,1021401,5.0,1.0,"He is an awesome teacher, cracks corny jokes a lot but theyre funny. explains very very well"
4982,1021401,4.5,2.0,"Had him for College Algebra and Trig.  Never did well in my high school math classes but I did very well in his class.  He is a GREAT teacher, funny too!"
4983,1021401,5.0,1.0,"Very self-explanatory and easy to follow, and has his funny moments. He makes the class interesting..."
4984,1021401,5.0,1.0,amazing !!!
4985,1021401,4.5,3.0,He's funny and easy to follow. *****
4986,1021401,5.0,2.0,He is best teacher I ever had at MSU. If you have chance to take his do it. It will be worth your time.
4987,1021401,5.0,1.0,"This professor was kind, and helpful. His sense of humor is very dry."
4988,1021401,4.0,2.0,Great teacher class is really easy liked him a lot and i rarely fell asleep! His jokes are funny!
4989,1021401,5.0,1.0,"Teaches by example. Homework program also gives step by step instructions so it's easy to learn if you've missed a class or two, or twenty."
4990,1021401,4.0,2.0,This teacher is a fun teacher. He makes jokes throughout class to keep your attention. He ask many questions to make sure you know the material. I highly suggest this teacher.
4991,1021401,5.0,1.0,Good teacher! Doesnt care if you come to class or not! I missed 33 times and still got a B! Easy class!
4992,1021401,5.0,1.0,"He is one of my favorite professors!  I hate math with a passion, but he makes it bearable by his unique way of teaching and overall cuteness (both physical and personality).  As you can tell, I have a slight crush on him!"
4993,1021401,4.5,1.0,"Banik is really awesome! I absolutely adore him. I had him for College Algebra and Trig, and thoroughly enjoyed each due to his lovely way of teaching and his overall demeanor. He's a great teacher. I'd recommend him to everyone!"
4994,1021401,5.0,2.0,Willing to help or explain anything. Really laid back. will extend HW deadlines if you need him to
4995,2455008,5.0,4.0,He is very patient and willing to answer any and all questions. He is also very knowledgeable about Engineering Econ. Does have quizzes that sort of take attendance but give you extra credit on homework.
4996,2184710,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Hardin is incredibly kind and helpful and wants his students to succeed. He was far too generous, and even pushed back the deadline for the paper twice because students asked him to. Students had the entire semester to work on their paper, and he even looked over drafts, so those who did poorly were completely at fault. Good notes  A on test"
4997,2184710,2.0,5.0,Look he is a great person just cant stay on topic. Im and education major and honestly I feel like imma fail. This class is not what I thought. You are graded on 4 things and 40% of your grade is a paper and a quiz. The other 60% is gonna murder you. Better hope you dont have any grad students in the class
4998,2184710,5.0,3.0,"Coolest professor of all time. He cracks jokes the whole class and learns most students' names. He made anthropology very interesting, exciting, and easy to learn. I would go to war for this man."
4999,2184710,4.0,2.0,"He is a very funny guy but is lectures sometimes can be boring since that is all he does. Be prepared because you only grades come from the test you take. Also if you questions do not email him because he will not get back with you, you better ask your questions in person."
5000,2184710,5.0,1.0,"Any class from Hardin, take. If you answer questions and introduce yourself he will take a liking to you. The course I took was only for an elective credit but I loved going. Easy class and a great teacher. (He also wasn't here all the time because he was on archaeological trips so his grad assistant taught, and she was great too.)"
5001,2184710,5.0,3.0,"He was really easy going, funny and made class interesting. Great elective, highly advise."
5002,2184710,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Hardin is one of the best professors I've had and I highly recommend him. Take good notes on the lectures and you'll do fine. He puts some info on the board, such as dates, but most of the information will be in the lecture. He cares about his students. He gives study guides. In this class there was 1 paper and 2 tests. No pop quizzes/homework."
5003,2291207,5.0,3.0,"Get ready to write papers. Also, you might not do so well on the first few, but you will get the hang of it. The professor is kinda hard to get along with for some students, but if you can find some common ground and participate in answering questions you will be fine."
5004,2291207,5.0,2.0,"This class was not particularly difficult. However, there is a lot of busy work."
5005,2250252,4.0,2.0,"He is a very nice guy and the labs are super fun so you'll want to go. Floral design isn't as easy as people make it out to be, but as long as you study for the Floral IDs you'll be fine. The lectures aren't mandatory unless it's one of the two test days. He lets you have fun with the designs and is very easygoing."
5006,2250252,4.0,2.0,tests are a little difficult. Flower ID quiz are difficult for those that are bad at spelling
5007,2250252,5.0,2.0,"I took Dr. Etheredge for Floral Design. It is literally a class where you get graded on knowing all about flowers and floral arranging - need I say more? He is great, offers amazing extra credit if you do let Floral Design go to the bottom of your priorities list, and the exams are exactly like the study guides. He is also really kind in lab!"
5008,2307621,5.0,2.0,This is a fun class! He gives extra credit for coming to class on low turnout days and gives a study guide for all of the tests which is super helpful! He also checks in on the required psychology study participation to make sure everyone is on track for the end of the semester.
5009,2307621,5.0,2.0,Gives lots of extra credit just for showing up for class. Gives study guide of what to study which is like test! Lots of fun!
5010,2577975,5.0,2.0,"This class is interesting and is an easy A! There is a weekly discussion board and extra credit quiz. There are 4 online exams that are open notes. The final is a short paper, but it is not hard at all. There are a few easy written assignments throughout the semester. Attendance is part of your grade, but the class is fun so you will want to go. "
5011,2577975,5.0,2.0,"Professor Scott is so passionate and knowledgeable about the subject matter; she presents information in a really unbiased way and is always willing to listen to different perspectives. She listens to music before class and brings in panels and facilitates discussions to keep lectures interesting; attendance is mandatory, but we all enjoy going!!"
5012,2577975,5.0,2.0,"Rachel Scott is the best lecturer I've ever had! Class is always interesting, and she makes sure everyone is comfortable. She's open for questions regarding class material and works to give you the best answer she can. She also helped me with questions regarding grad school. Truly cares about her students and keeps the workload light! "
5013,2577975,5.0,2.0,"Rachel is AMAZING. You have to listen to lectures because the slides are scant, but she is such a great teacher and makes the material interesting and engaging that it doesn't matter. There's weekly quizzes, four tests, and a final paper, not an exam. Cannot recommend her enough. If you literally just pay attention it's an easy A."
5014,2577975,5.0,3.0,"Rachel Scott is such a fun professor. I had her for Human Sexual Behavior, and I loved that class. She makes the material easy to learn, and the way she presents her lectures is very helpful. She is such a cool and chill professor. I 11/10 recommend her!!"
5015,2577975,5.0,3.0,"Good teacher, learned a lot."
5016,2577975,5.0,3.0,Such a great professor! I had her for Human Sexual Behavior and I love the way she presented the material. She answered all of our questions and made everyone feel comfortable even though it was a little awkward at first. The exams are easy just study and listen in class. Quizzes every week. 2 papers and a contraceptive poster.
5017,2627144,5.0,2.0,"Had her for two 2 classes, one online and one in person and in both the book was a required aspect, but her lectures were great and was able to easily teach the material. Highly recommend taking any of her classes, a new teacher so was lenient with grading."
5018,2618960,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lv is highly knowledgeable about the topics he teaches. The topics he covers are very applicable to real world usage, and breaks it down into easy-to-understand terms. He is almost always accessible outside of class if you need help. If you can show that you are trying in the class then you will be fine."
5019,2618960,4.0,4.0,Very good explanation of each chapter. He shows a lot of passion and knowledge regarding the courses he teaches. He works different examples with various difficulties so that you can understand the topics in depth. Throughout the semester he showed dedication and interest in the students learning more about the class.
5020,2618960,1.0,3.0,"Honestly not that great of a professor. He wasted time every class talking about how few people were there, then complained about wasting time. He laughed almost every time a student asked a question. He barely worked any examples. He would cancel class, post a video, and reteach the video in the next class, again wasting time. would not take again"
5021,1349207,1.5,2.0,DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS AND HAS HORRIBLE TEACHER ASSISTANTS THAT TEACH HIS CLASS!!!
5022,1701471,5.0,3.0,Hybrid class because of COVID. He is very understanding and says that if it is too much work he can cut it back. No one in the class had that problem. And read the stories! The tests are easy and you get to have the book with you. There is a paper to write but relatively easy. I am not an English major and this class was so interesting!!
5023,1701471,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Atkinson is a great teacher &amp; is really nice! The readings are pretty interesting and his lectures on them could be a bit boring, but if you read about it, youd want to listen! Only 2 tests (not too hard but PAY ATTENTION). Hes understanding and helpful if you reach out. He also offers creative options instead of the 2 papers. Daily quizzes."
5024,1701471,4.0,3.0,"He's a fun and interesting teacher to take. The reading is easy and interesting and the quizzes he gives aren't hard as long as you do the reading (sparknotes work too for the ""reading encouragement exercises"")."
5025,1701471,3.5,3.0,"Readings are not long, and you'll want to actually read them. He gives ""reading encouragement exercises"" and they are clear cut and easy if you have read. You don't have any actual papers other than the final, but you have a 500 word response due about every 2 weeks. Tests are easy if you memorize the names of the readings and the author names."
5026,1701471,4.5,3.0,"This class requires a good bit of reading so definitely buy the books and read everything before class. The little quizzes are easy, but you really have to read."
5027,1701471,4.5,2.0,I really enjoyed my Honors American Literature course with this professor! He is very easy to understand and if you go to class I'm sure you will be able to relate to what he is saying on some level. I was rarely bored and made an easy A. He even gives you bonus points for going to short seminars relating to the coursework. Would Highly Recommend!
5028,1996391,5.0,2.0,If you are like me and had no music experience going into her class then you definitely need to attend class. She gives infinite correction opportunities on all homeworks and has very fair tests. Shes a really good teacher who you can tell cares about her students.
5029,2438764,4.0,4.0,"This business calc class is beyond boring and lecture heavy, but with that said Mr. Kim is very accessible out of class and has very flexible office hours if you need help with the material. There is no attendance policy but if you aren't good at math then it is important to go to the lectures, the tests are difficult and aren't like the homework."
5030,1111663,2.0,4.0,"Professor Bradshaw is probably a better teacher in person, however, he is extremely not understanding when it comes to missing due dates. He had no sympathy for me for missing an online test. I wouldn't recommend him. Very boring and does not answer emails. I emailed him a week ago and am still waiting for him to respond."
5031,1111663,3.0,5.0,"Mr. Bradshaw is an incredibly smart man, probably the most intelligent you will come into contact to in YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. That being said he thinks this class will help you so much in the life he truly wants you to learn the material. He is extremely difficult but you learn so much. I quote him on this &quot;Extra credit is the reincarnation of satan&quot;."
5032,1111663,5.0,2.0,"A lot of people complained about this teacher but I thought he was really good. To be honest, the people who constantly complained were the people who probably never even bought the book and never paid attention. He teaches very simply, one step at a time. So I was never confused. There is a lot of book reading, especially for tests and quizzes."
5033,1111663,3.0,3.0,"When I read these reviews I was scared to take him but if you simply read the book, then you should do fine. Just make sure you really understand the material. I enjoyed the class!"
5034,1111663,4.0,3.0,He has a different style of Teaching but you will learn SO MUCH!  He is an excellent professor
5035,1111663,1.5,5.0,Don't take him! 5question quiz only five minutes to take it. Nothing he goes over in class relates to the test
5036,1111663,4.0,3.0,Uses textbook a lot on his quizzes but if you do your readings or have common sense you should be just fine.
5037,1111663,1.0,5.0,this has to be the dumbest smart person that I know!!
5038,1111663,2.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE PSYCH FROM THIS TEACHER! A lot of the stuff on the test is from the reading that he doesnt go over. Lots of textbook reading. Be prepared to study the reading a lot if you want to make a decent grade. Hes a nice guy i just dont think hes a good teacher. Take Psych or honors psych from crachenski (however you spell it)!
5039,145007,3.5,2.0,She is good teacher. She spends first part of class reviewing what was learned in previous classes. Tests are fair and not difficult at all but can be somewhat long.
5040,145007,3.0,2.0,"She explains things thoroughly and would probably help, but she tends to make fun of those who don't get it and/or do poorly on tests.  Tests can be annoyingly long and require quite a bit of Trig. All of the homework corresponds to particular problems that are in the book, which is nice.  It is easy if you have time to review her made-up problems."
5041,145007,5.0,2.0,She is such a great teacher! She thoroughly explains each type of problem you will encounter and answers every question clearly. Her tests are simple and straight-forward if you study. The homework assignments are once or twice a week online with under 20 questions each. Great teacher!
5042,145007,4.5,2.0,Great teacher! If you do not do good in her classes its your fault! She makes it very easy to pass. Probably the best Cal 1&2 at MSU.
5043,145007,2.0,2.0,"She moves really fast for her Calculus 1 class. Her notes are okay but she confuses people a lot by explaining too much or by showing too many different ways of working a problem. I like how her quizzes allow notes, and how she uses the same questions from notes on her tests. However she is not the best teacher especially for first time learners."
5044,145007,5.0,1.0,Good teacher. Shows a lot of examples and tests are straight from them.
5045,145007,3.5,3.0,"I had her for statistics. Her lecture was boring, but we divided into smaller classes the other two days of the week and that helped alot. We have homework and a quiz online everyweek. But you will do fine if you work hard and ask for help. She will help you out. Not that bad of a class, just not very interesting at all."
5046,145007,2.5,3.0,"Took her for an online Intro to Statistics class. I am not a math person but carried a B until the final exam. In my opinion exams weigh too much, I had a B all semester and got a C as my final grade because of the exam."
5047,145007,4.0,4.0,she is a good teacher just work hard and she will work with you a little effort goes a long way with her she is old school but at least she speaks english.
5048,145007,5.0,1.0,"very helpful, im bad at math and she made it soo easy to learn highly recommed!!"
5049,145007,5.0,1.0,No Comments
5050,145007,5.0,3.0,Super teacher!! Very helpful!
5051,145007,3.5,3.0,No Comments
5052,145007,5.0,3.0,awesome teacher
5053,145009,5.0,3.0,"GO TO REVIEW SESSIONS! He offers them before every test and will tell you about 20 problems. Five of those problems will be the test questions, just with the numbers swapped. He is sometimes hard to understand but he will repeat himself and is very kind. Have &lt; 2 absences and make an A on the final and you get an A in the class (wow)."
5054,145009,4.0,3.0,"He is very nice, and will help on exams to a reasonable extent. He is kind of hard to understand at first, but you should be able to understand him eventually. He gives a drop exam but there is no homework grade. I think he is a solid choice for Physics I honestly. I really am glad I took the class with him vs another professor"
5055,145009,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Su was difficult to understand, but he really cares about his students and will help you if you have any questions. There was no homework, but it was helpful to do the recommended problems in the textbook and the ones he worked in class. He hosts review sessions the day before exam and goes over questions that you see on the actual exam."
5056,145009,2.0,4.0,"He's a very nice man, but his handwriting is difficult to read and he can be hard to understand sometimes. Basically just works examples during class. He gives you old tests which are very similar to the ones in class, and studying those was the way i studied. Difficult class, material isnt taught well, lots of studying."
5057,145009,4.0,4.0,He is so sweet and if you make an effort to talk to him and go to his office once a week you will be fine. He emails his old tests out and there is NO homework. You can barely understand him but just work with him.
5058,145009,5.0,3.0,"He teaches by examples and theory. He wants you to know the concepts. He gives the test he used from last year and some problems from the book to go over. If you study over those there is no reason not to make a 100. He is hard to understand, but he will gladly repeat himself if you ask. The final was the exact same as the one from last year."
5059,145009,3.0,4.0,"You must put in the effort to understand the material outside of class. The lecture consists of him working examples straight out of the book, which you can find a pdf of it online. To prepare for the exams, he gives you a short list of problems, old tests (which are exactly what's on the test), and he holds help sessions the week of the exam."
5060,145009,3.0,3.0,"He's a little hard to understand and his cursive isn't great. But he doesn't put any problems on the test that he hasn't gone over in class. He gives you all of his old tests before the exam along with what problems you need to be able to work. Don't try to solve a problem different from how he taught you in class, you won't get credit on a test"
5061,145009,5.0,3.0,Dr. Su was a very accommodating professor that really cared about how we did in his course and if we were really learning. Although in a larger lecture he may not have the opportunity to show it off everyday as he does in his smaller upper level courses going to his office opens a great door to a very successful class experience.
5062,145009,1.0,5.0,"Test are exactly like the old ones, but he lied to us about switching stuff up.  He is he hard to understand and his script is worse."
5063,145009,3.0,3.0,He is so adorable and will try to help outside of class. But I can't understand anything he says half of the time.
5064,145009,2.5,2.0,cannot for the love of god understand the man
5065,145009,4.0,4.0,Hard to understand but will help outside of class
5066,145009,4.0,2.0,"A little hard to understand, but so sweet.  Do the homework and you'll know just what is on the tests.  Or, if you can find the old tests, they are usually the exact same with different numbers."
5067,145009,1.0,2.0,What did he say&#63;
5068,145009,1.0,3.0,CAN'T UNDERSTAND A DARN WORD HE SAYS!!!!!!!
5069,145009,3.5,3.0,"I never got to the point I could understand anything he presented in class! But he is very, very nice and will do anything to help you do well. He's always reachable if you have a question and replies very quickly to emails. Read the chapters and WORK ALL OF THE PROBLEMS he assigns - this will make the difference between A's and F's on the exams."
5070,145009,3.0,4.0,Hard to understand when he talks but it's an ok class if you attend and do what he says.
5071,145009,3.5,2.0,"Great prof to have for physics.  Even though be may be a little hard to understand, you'll eventually adapt.  His grading is very lenient and he'll do anything to make sure you understand the material."
5072,145009,3.0,2.0,he was an excellent teacher
5073,145009,3.5,2.0,"Dr Su is EXCELLENT if you are new to physics and need the course for your major!!!  He may be a little hard to understand at first, but his exams are clear, relavent, and straightforward."
5074,145009,2.5,5.0,"Can't really understand his talking, very fast"

5076,1259135,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING prof & class. Fair,funny,& caring. 4 tests, optional final, 150pts each, conceptual- definitions, matching, short answers, & 1 essay. Take detailed notes. Grades attendance. If confused/have questions, ask to meet after class. GO TO SI. They reinforce & provide extra necessary info. Long labs, TAs are helpful, provide detailed instructions."
5077,1259135,3.0,4.0,He explains things well but the test are short answer and essay. If you go to class and take good notes you'll do fine. Also the SI and TA's help a lot! If you are confused he loves when people ask questions so don't be afraid.
5078,1259135,5.0,4.0,Great professor.  He loves his subject and in turn will teach it to you if you let him.  Come to class every day and read the online book.  The TA over the lab will also be helpful.

5080,1259137,4.0,3.0,"Discussion section once a week is where this class really matters. I went to one lecture all year and made a solid B. I had 3 off weeks with my discussion is what hurt me. For taking only one AP history in high school, you really only need to spend an hour a week reading. Course reader &gt; textbook if you are low on time. Cost money for course reader"
5081,1259137,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Lavine is not a bad guy, he does not even grade any of the tests or papers. The tests were kind of complex, he gave you a set of questions he would pick from but you had to know the answers to all 32 essay questions for the mid term and all 64 questions for the final to make an A. Just get tight with your TA's and do what they say and an A easy"
5082,1259137,3.0,3.0,"I took this as an online class and it was actually mostly done by Kasey Mosley Ph. D candidate. It was just terrible. The work and stuff wasn't that bad, but it could be weeks or months before you got grades back on anything so it was pretty much impossible to keep up with your grade in the class. I would NOT recommend."
5083,1259137,4.5,3.0,Really funny down to earth guy.  His lectures are pretty clear.  Not too hip on the discussion section but that's mainly due to my TA.  Pretty good class.
5084,2832006,3.0,2.0,"Prof. Dudgeon is super sweet and a very nice lady. I personally havent enjoyed her lectures, just because of the ways the teaches. We don't do many examples so I kind of just figure out the stuff by myself. First test is ridiculously easy, and the other ones are very doable with light studying. "
5085,1160845,5.0,4.0,Great professor and a very engaging personality. Made A&P II an interesting class. Dr. Honea really cares and respects his students.
5086,1160845,5.0,2.0,Truly an amazing instructor! He really made it easy to understand the material with his unique and effective teaching style. I really wish there were more teachers that are as involved and compassionate as Dr. Honea.
5087,1160845,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely love this man.  He is very knowledgeable, understanding, and breaks down any academic material into easy to follow and comprehend information for any dummy out there.  He is extremely passionate about his teaching and promotes an atmosphere that is premium for learning.  There isn't a single person I wouldn't recommend him to.  -Janet"
5088,1160845,5.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Honea's class in the summer of 2010. He made a relatively tough subject like Exercise Physiology and broke it down to the easiest of terms. He is very knowlegable and is willing to help if you ask questions. Not only is he an excellent teacher, he makes his classes feel like a family. I would recommend Dr. Honea to any and everyone!"
5089,1160845,5.0,5.0,Dr. Honea tought my Exercise Physiology class in Summer 2010. I think I learned more in his 1 month class than I have the entire time I've been in college (2 years) He's very straight forward about what he expects of you. He also does care about you and how you do in his class. Ask questions and he'll answer them! A+ Teacher. STUDY!
5090,1160845,4.5,3.0,Dr. Honea was an awesome teacher to have. The class exericise physiology seems to sound hard but he made it fun and entertaining. We were a family not a class and he was very open to helping all of his students out. I recommend him to anyone and everyone.
5091,1160845,5.0,3.0,Dr.Honea treated our class like we were family!  He had high expectations for all of us and was willing to help anyway he could.  He taught with enthusiasm and classes were never boring! He encouraged us to be honest and express ourselves while keeping others feelings into consideration! One thing he was strict about was doing labs correctly!
5092,1160845,4.5,5.0,"Biochemistry used to intimidate me. He makes hard material bareable and understandable. cheap book and long notes. love the class. &quot;Good in, bad away&quot;:).  Teaches with passion and is funny. Class is three hours long but goes fast with his attitude.  He says the brain can only be stimulated for half hour so we take a break every thirty mins."
5093,1160845,5.0,2.0,"Treats students like adults, fair grader very understanding. He will not require you to buy expensive texbooks that you only may use for 2 chapeter as other professor will require. He is just really down to earth.Never known anyone not to like taking his class."
5094,1160845,5.0,5.0,This is the single best professor I have ever had in five years of college.  He is outstanding.  Make sure you sign of for this guy.  He is a fair grader.  Gets tests back a little on the slow side but might be to your advantage.  He also talks about his wife and shows pictures.  Great family man who teaches with a passion.
5095,1160845,5.0,5.0,"Don't have to come to class, you will want to. 1 of those classes you don't want to miss. A very fair professor. Doesn't require text book cause notes are given. Tests given back slowly but to your benefit.  Hard material, great professor. The best I have had at State for four years and I used to be in Biol, also. He is my teacher of the year."
5096,1160845,5.0,5.0,"Wow. Is this guy excited or what&#63;  Very passionate about his work, apparently. Extremely honest so far. Comprehensive tests sux but probably is ok. Attendance isn't necessary but requested. Not big on book use either. Notes are printed three slides at a time with a bunch of them. Big on metabolism. It is almost a must. So far,so good."
5097,1881754,2.0,3.0,"Made an A on all tests/quizzes, made a C on the final. Got a B in the class. She doesn't actually grade your tests. TA's do. And they all grade differently and it's unfair. The tests are done in blue books and you're given terms and you just have to write a couple paragraphs about them. Fast lecturer. I couldn't have taken notes without typing them"
5098,1881754,5.0,1.0,"Great lecturer, and easy to listen to. Easy tests."
5099,2397870,4.0,3.0,Mrs. Good is a wonderful lecturer and always goes the extra mile to properly explain everything in a way that we can understand. Attendance is very important as otherwise you will wind up behind and it will be quite difficult to dig yourself out of that hole.
5100,2397870,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Good is a great instructor. Her lectures are very clear, informative, and concise. I learned a lot in her algebra class."
5101,2397870,4.0,1.0,"Her class wasn't too hard and she gives amazing notes. However, I had classes during all of her office hours and she basically refused to arrange another time we could meet for me to pick up something or ask a question. ALWAYS attend test review days she tells you everything on the test and does practice problems with you that you ask for."
5102,2397870,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Good provide the notes for each chapter which I loved. She makes little jokes here and there, and she was always open to clearing up any confusion in class or doing office hours."
5103,2397870,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Good is great! If you take notes and just listen to her, you should be fine. I never made below a 90 on her tests. There is homework and a quiz every week, but you have multiple attempts on each."
5104,2397870,2.0,5.0,Lots of homework and she goes through lectures very quickly without stopping
5105,2397870,4.0,3.0,"Always provides great notes that cover every possible form of the problems you'll see on the test. She is very accessible and caring and will always work with you to make sure you understand the material. All of the assignments other than the exams are online, and there you also have examples if you still need additional help."
5106,2397870,4.0,3.0,"I liked her a lot. I never have liked math, but she made it tolerable. Only one homework assignment every 2-3 weeks and it was easy. Tests and quizzes are average. She is super nice and easy to get in contact with; very understanding. A few projects, but they were really fun and easy."
5107,2397870,5.0,2.0,"This class is so easy. She uploads blank powerpoints before class so you have to go to get the work. She explains everything in detail, and is very easy to reach if you have questions. There is a lot of homework every week. The tests are exactly like the mastery quizzes."
5108,2397870,5.0,3.0,Loved her so much. She was easy to talk to and thoroughly taught each lesson in the easiest way possible. As long as you do your homework and go to class you will have a good grade.
5109,2397870,4.0,4.0,"She is a wonderful teacher! So caring and always willing to help. She does have pop quizzes almost every class but she tells about it before hand. Her class is hard, but if you put in the work you will be fine. Lots of group projects and homework."
5110,2397870,5.0,4.0,"Takes her rules seriously but the lectures and the homework are designed to prep you for the tests which are far easier than the homework. Every problem on the homework has an example from the lecture so you're never caught off guard. She's incredibly kind, explains problems well, and was always available when I needed help."
5111,2397870,5.0,4.0,"Mrs. Good made Structures of Real Numbers enjoyable. To me, her tests were hard at first just because it was such simple math that I overthought everything. Once we got to older math I began to do better on tests. Mrs. Good is a great professor and she loves her students. She does give pop quizzes but they're 5 questions and she warns you before."
5112,2397870,5.0,2.0,"She was so great! Entertaining class time, enjoyable lectures and projects, and I actually learned useful material!! She is very good at her job, especially in Structure of Real Numbers."
5113,2397870,5.0,3.0,"good professor. she goes over the notes thoroughly and does not mind answer questions at all. i would highly recommend printing the notes before going to class. go to class because she does not post worked notes, only the blank ones. she can come off as &quot;blunt,&quot; but she's never mean or disrespectful."
5114,2397870,5.0,4.0,"I loved this class. Abigail is such a good teacher, and she knows how to teach. The lectures are very straight forward. Be sure to do the homework because you have homework quizzes. There are also a lot of group projects. Be sure to study what she tells you is on the test. Tests are very straight forward. I would take again."
5115,2397870,5.0,3.0,This professor is super great. She is very clear and concise. She makes sure you understand the material and is super nice outside of class. I would definitely take her again.
5116,2397870,5.0,3.0,I am not the brightest when it comes to math so I was super hesitant when it came to Calculus because I never took it in high school. That being said Professor Good made it very easy to understand and I enjoyed her math class as much as anyone who is not good at math could. She was a very GOOD professor;)
5117,2397870,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Good made College Algebra simple and easy to understand! Having it twice a week at 8 am wasn't easy, but the class itself was made easy thanks to her. Don't forget to go to the lab and do the homework/quizzes and you'll be fine!"
5118,2397870,5.0,2.0,She is the best math teacher I have ever had and made Calc 1 very easy to understand. Her review sheets are very similar to the test and her teaching style makes it simple to pass the class. An A is possible as long as you do the work. Would recommend her to anyone.
5119,2397870,4.0,3.0,Ms. Good taught the subject well. Her lectures could sometimes be drawn out but it is hard to make Calculus very interesting. She made sure everyone knew that she was available outside of class and through email for questions or help. Ms. Good is also a good person in general through what I could tell through our conversations.
5120,2397870,4.0,2.0,"The lectures are super helpful and she goes through every problem (sometimes multiple times in different ways). Everything is done online. The homework is a lot, but you have a week to do it. Make sure to get to the math domain as early as possible. You have multiple attempts on all the quizzes."
5121,2397870,2.0,5.0,"Very blunt. Gets mad and punishes the whole class if anyone is sleeping/on their phone. Tests make up most of your grade, studying is a must. Dont need the textbook. Gives a TON of homework. Personally wouldnt take her again."
5122,2397870,5.0,4.0,I never understood math until this class. she was very easy and worked everything out throughly. posts notes online and is always available for help!
5123,2397870,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Good was an ok professor. She posted blank notes that we could fill in class and posted worked notes online, but she will take away that privilege if people aren't taking notes. She gives you a study guide online before each teach and if you know it, you should pass. She also gave us 4 drop HW and quiz grades which really saved me."
5124,2397870,3.0,4.0,"The class itself can be very stressful because Professor Good can come across as intimidating! Print off the blank notes she post , they will help you during her lectures. Expect lots of homework every night and quizzes every week. The mastery quizzes (study guides) she puts up a week before the test, isn't always what is on the test."
5125,2397870,3.0,2.0,LOTS of homework questions with about 10 questions on the actual quiz.
5126,2397870,3.0,3.0,Your quizzes and test are online. Print the blank notes they will help you pass the class
5127,2397870,5.0,1.0,Never have grasped math as well as I have this semester. I accredit it all to her teaching structure. She provides you blank copies of notes to fill in during class. Doesn't skip a step in any problem.
5128,2397870,4.0,4.0,"Math sucks, but Ms. Good has honestly helped me understand things in Alg. highschool never taught me. She is very strict about technology in class and does expect you to know a lot. She teaches pretty quick in class &amp; its easy to zone out. Mostly online though so if you do your work you should be good."
5129,2397870,3.0,4.0,"Ms. Good is an okay teacher. She kind of expects you to already know stuff, which I definitely didn't. I took her for Calculus 1, and it was a little tough. She does give a study guide before each test, and if you learn how to do everything on it, you'll pass the test. I also never used the book."
5130,562868,1.0,5.0,"Stay away from this one, I am an a/b student and have never had this much trouble pleasing a professor. This is supposed to be a freshman level class but I am a continuing student about to graduate and I may well fail this class. I spend 6+ hours on each homework and still get comment from him like not enough information. I use 3-4 sources besides "
5131,562868,3.0,3.0,I love history but this class was really boring and he didn't make the material very interesting.
5132,562868,1.5,4.0,You might as well not buy the history book for this class because your only assignment is to write essays on Dr. Nordin's lectures compared to other views on the same subjects.
5133,562868,4.0,1.0,Dr. Nordin is a great teacher. The only thing is that you have to attend class to take good notes.  For the test he requires you to use 2 outside sources on a subject that you have discussed in class. You simply right a paper on that subject hand it in on test day and it is a easy A.

5136,2610871,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Colaco was a fun professor and made Medical Ethics SO interesting. There was a lot to read for homework, but if you read and went to class the open-note quizzes were easy As. There were no exams; only one group project, participation, and a final essay. If you put in the effort you will make an A. You will also learn a lot from his class!"
5137,964283,1.0,5.0,"Awful, awful teacher. Do NOT take him if at all possible. He is a chauvinist and an idiot!"

5139,2340562,4.0,3.0,"Mrs. Fason is extremely knowledgeable about what she teaches. She is passionate about what she teaches and wants her students to do well. If you show her respect, she will return the favor. She has always been extremely nice and willing to help me. Her class is mainly powerpoint lectures with the occasional group activity."
5140,2340566,4.0,2.0,"This class was taught online. He is a good teacher and he cares. Lots of quizzes and you will have to read a book, but it is very good and eye opening. Did not use the textbook. There is one big project but do well enough early on in the class and you will have some wiggle room on the grade. Gives lots of extra credit opportunities, take advantage."
5141,2340566,4.0,2.0,I had this course online due to covid. He is very kind and he cares deeply about the students. Lots of small quizzes on each reading and topic. He does not go over the topics but they are explained well enough you can understand it. I recommend working ahead. There are two bigger projects but mostly quizzes.
5142,2340566,4.0,3.0,Dr. Wheeler is a great teacher and he expects a lot from his students. Each class is 1 point so make sure you go to class. He lectures from a powerpoint and he gives you the templates from each class so it's easy to study for tests. 4 tests and one of them drops so make sure you try your best on the first 3 tests so you wont have to take the last.
5143,2340566,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wheeler is great; knowledgeable, caring, and helpful. He is quick to respond to emails and all his assignment instructions are clear and easy to understand. He includes stories and videos to make his lectures interesting. He also provides a fill in the blank outline prior to his lectures. The only downfall is that he is extremely monotone."
5144,276205,5.0,2.0,"She is a very nice lady who is very willing to help during office hours.  She proves all the theorems, but does not test on them.  Do the homework she assigns on the board and you will come out with an A!"
5145,276205,5.0,2.0,"Goes over theory and works example problems. I went to her office several times and she was very nice/helpful, because she could tell that I was serious and working very hard.  Very nice lady.  Not too difficult if you work hard.  I had her for Calculus I and II, and took her again for Calculus IV.  Very helpful in preparing for Engineering major."
5146,276205,5.0,1.0,"She teaches theoretically and proves everything, but she is very thorough and an extremely nice lady."
5147,276205,5.0,3.0,"I had her for Calculus I and II, and made A's in both even though I had only Algebra and Trig prior (went to small high school).  I went to her office a few times.  Was very helpful because she could see I was working hard and not looking for shortcuts.  Tough, but fair and not too hard if you put forth effort.  You'e not in high school any longer."
5148,276205,2.5,5.0,"Teacher is awful, hard to comprehend what she is saying and expects everyone to know things from classes they haven't taken. Homework is never taken up but doesn't help anyway. The only notes are theorems and definitions with maybe 1 or 2 examples per class. Notes are literally word for word from book. Doesn't really simplify or explain."
5149,276205,2.0,5.0,"Three words are all you need to know about Scarborough, &quot;drop her now.&quot;  She has absolutely no patience whatsoever with students who are weak on their math skill set.  Other reviews of her are accurate.  She's a flunking machine, and proud of it.  If you take her class, expect to spend your afternoon's in the tutoring center in Allen Hall."
5150,276205,2.0,4.0,did proofs the whole class..she would help if you went to her office
5151,276205,2.5,5.0,"I had her years ago, and she's the reason why I had to change my major from CSE. I agree with the other person who said she expects you to already know Calculus. I came from an Academy that didn't teach it at all, so it was extremely new to me. Didn't matter to Mrs. Sc. I hate to pile on, but other comments are spot on. Her class was depressing."
5152,276205,3.0,5.0,Had her for Linear. Consider her devil incarnate. Been there since the Crusades. She taught my boss at my co-op linear. His words to me &quot;If you get her drop&quot;! Nothing but theorems no side help and just a generally mean old lady
5153,276205,1.0,5.0,"Mrs. Scarborough is extremely hard. She worked a low amount of examples and when she explained theorems, it was extremely confusing."

5158,276205,1.0,5.0,"Will take entire class periods to prove theorys; which, in turn, makes everything way harder to understand. She doesn't exactly describe what she is doing either. She just writes on the board and continues on..."
5159,276205,1.0,5.0,"The best quote I got from her was, &quot;I refuse to cover that topic AGAIN!!! Teach it to your self... or fail&quot;"

5161,276205,3.5,3.0,"Not bad for grad students, but horrible for undergrad."
5162,276205,1.5,4.0,"If you already know Calculus, take her.  She expects you to!  Don't expect any straight forward explainations either.  It's either more than you cared to know or &quot;that's just how it is.&quot;"
5163,1881839,1.0,5.0,"Unless you had four years of Latin in high school, you won't get an A. Dr. Bartera is the toughest grader in the foreign language department. You have 2 homework assignments and a quiz each week so be prepared to work. He is very strict in his translations and will not cut any slack for his students. Don't expect a good grade no matter your effort."
5164,1881839,5.0,4.0,"Latin is hard. If you're just trying to get an easy language credit, this is not the class for you. However, if you want to actually learn something and advance further into the Classics, please take Bartera. He knows his stuff. And he will definitely make sure that you do too. On the outside, he seems to be difficult. However, he really cares."
5165,1881839,2.0,1.0,"Long lectures, won't stop talking until the exact end of class. Quizzes and exams are taken online. Does love what he teaches."
5166,1881839,4.0,4.0,"There is a bit of homework, but it isn't long. it's not graded, but it is we went always went over it in front of the class. He is a cool professor, knows a lot, and is always willing to help you if you at least try. He also seems to love questions and interaction, so dont be afraid to ask or say things in his class. i'm taking him again for Latin2"
5167,1881839,4.0,3.0,"You have to work really hard if you have not had Latin before, but he does a really good job of explaining things."
5168,1898238,3.0,5.0,"This was an ok class. Teresa made her lectures interesting for an 8am, but the projects outside of class take up a decent chunk of your free time. Like most professors in this major, her view of the industry is very specifically focused on production side of things, and she tends to talk more about jobs in production than any other side of it."
5169,1898238,1.5,5.0,Created high expectations early on and slowly became more and more disorganized. She takes on too much responsibility for herself to manage and passes her shortcomings onto the students.
5170,2365190,2.0,2.0,"Bruno is nice, but disorganized - he often forgot to post study guides or other class material, and often pushed back due dates and test dates. The class was easy for this reason but I didn't learn much. He also takes attendance randomly, but usually doesn't bother."
5171,2184969,3.0,1.0,Really nice lady. I enjoyed her class but the material was sometimes boring.
5172,2184969,5.0,1.0,Never showed up to class still got an A. Idk anything else about her but the class is easy if u do the weekly quizzes
5173,2184969,1.0,1.0,"She is an awful teacher. I get up @8 am for her to show up 30 min late with nothing but a coffee in her hands, and the next class I show up @8 am again and she let us out @8:15. Waste of my time. All tests were open-note, open-book and gave us like a 3 hr time period with 3 days to choose to take it. Easy A, just a bunch of bull."
5174,2184969,5.0,1.0,She was the best professor ever! All we did was take notes in class and she would goof off with us. Most days she even cancels class. Her test are exactly like the notes. I would only study the night before. She gives a ton of extra credit.
5175,2184969,2.0,2.0,She is nice. She for sure picks her favorite students. She tells a lot of stories that have absolutely nothing to do with the lecture. she's cool though
5176,2184969,5.0,2.0,Prof. Hinton is such an amazing woman. It is evident that she is extremely compassionate about her students and what she is teaching. She is always willing to help and she tries her best to make lectures enjoyable. Some tests are harder than others according to what they're on but you should be able to find everything on quizlet.
5177,2184969,1.0,3.0,"Pop Quiz every week. Read the whole sociology book.. Half the test is little stuff you have to read about. Not very professional. Does NOT reply to emails. Test questions are very tricky. if extra credit comes up, DO IT ALL! Do not skip class, you lose points each time. And you won't know which day the quiz is on so you have to go each day."
5178,2184969,4.0,1.0,You can miss up to 5 classes. You have one quiz online due each Friday and it is very easy. You only have a midterm and a final. No Homework. Very easy class. You don't use the book until at the end when you are studying for finals. She gives study guides for them both but there are always more info on the test than stated in the study guide.
5179,2635534,5.0,1.0,"Great First Year Experience (FYE) class. The assignments include in class arranging of flowers, and that's it. She is the sweetest lady and will work with you in every aspect of this course. Many students end up falling in love with floral design and continue to take more classes under Ms. McDougald. Highly recommend taking as a de-stressor."
5180,1734430,5.0,3.0,10/10 Professor! Does not give unnecessary work and is very accommodating to students' needs. Learned a lot in his class!
5181,1734430,5.0,3.0,Great professor.
5182,1734430,5.0,2.0,Steve is by far my favorite professor. I have had him for Web 1 and Web 2 now. He really knows what he is talking about and if you have questions he is great at giving the answer in a way that you can understand. The labs are my favorite part because he actually shows you how to code the assignments that you are given. 10/10 Overall!!
5183,1734430,5.0,3.0,"I took his Web Development I class and I'm about to take Web Development II. There's few classes, so each one is very important to go to so you don't fall behind. As long as you go and pay attention, you should be fine. He gives very good examples for each assignment and you can use previous homework and sources for exams. He cares about students."
5184,1734430,5.0,1.0,"Probably one of the best teachers on campus. His lectures are simple and he explains everything and goes through it with you while he is teaching it. He definitely made learning the html, php, and css a lot easier. He is also easy to access when you need help on homework."
5185,1734430,5.0,2.0,Steve is a great professor. Explained everything thoroughly and made it simple. Every week there is a homework assignment similar to lectures. There was 4 exams which were open notes and similar to homework or lectures. Easy A if you show up to class and do exams and homework.
5186,1734430,5.0,1.0,"Mr Canfield is awesome. I made a solid A in both his Web I, and Web II classes, all tests are open notes, and a few days before the test you will have a homework assignment that will be very similar to the test. Hands down one of the best professors at MSU. The lectures are presented well and are very easy to understand, and is very accessible."
5187,1734430,5.0,2.0,Great professor. Lectures and material is very easy to understand and the powerpoints are very helpful outside of class. Test are easy also if you do the homework and class assignments.
5188,1734430,5.0,2.0,Steve is a laid back guy with a refined and organized schedule for class work. Hes great at keeping the Lectures engaging and straight to the point. 10/10 would recommend
5189,1734430,4.0,1.0,Hes a real cool dude. He explains everything thoroughly. Its an easy class; all exams are open notes.
5190,1734430,4.0,1.0,"He's a very nice, interesting guy. Class is super easy and you can get by without learning very much. If you want an easy A take him, if you want to learn more about the subject take Dr. Pearson."
5191,1734430,5.0,1.0,"Best teacher at MSU!! Very easy class. He makes it easy to understand how to do something. Very straightforward. Always there to help you inside and outside of class. Makes class interesting. Don't need textbook, will still pass without it."
5192,1734430,5.0,4.0,Professor Canfield is awesome! I learned so much from his class. Way more than I expected. He is thorough and interesting. I highly recommend him.
5193,1734430,5.0,1.0,"Steve is a really cool teacher and a really nice guy.  Had him for Visual Basic.  The class is straightforward and if you don't understand something, he will answer every question.  There is not that much outside word and the exams aren't difficult.  If you need a programming class, take Steve Canfield for Visual Basic Programming."
5194,1734430,5.0,2.0,He's an awesome teacher. I took him during the summer for COBOL. As long as you understand what's going on when he teaches it. You will do great. I would highly recommend him for Visual Basic or COBOL programming.
5195,1734430,4.5,1.0,Very easy and interesting class. Never studied and aced all of the programs and written tests. I RECOMEND HIM!
5196,2742048,5.0,2.0,She is so sweet she is one of the most loving and caring professors I have ever had. 
5197,2742048,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Russo made me fall in love with psychology and her class was so interesting! You could tell that she was passionate about what she was teaching and she was always very engaging. Her class is lecture heavy, but she makes it fun with different interactive activities every once in a while! Highly recommend! She is the best!"
5198,2742048,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Russo is a fantastic professor - take her for Gen Psych if you can! The lectures are fun and interactive, and she does everything in her power to help you succeed. She's always available after class to answer questions, and she never makes you feel dumb for having to repeat things."
5199,2381606,4.0,3.0,"This class was always lots of fun. She hands out extra credit like candy. We had several projects, the instructions for those were often unclear and it often seemed like her first time with these projects (I think it was). There are several quizzes (tests) that are LECTURE HEAVY and are on RANDOM facts from the lectures. Attendance MATTERS. Easy A."
5200,2381606,2.0,2.0,"She is kind of crazy. She screams about random things a lot and is never prepared for anything. She lectures sometimes then screams at least 20 times afterwards. She isn't very clear when it comes to instructions and assigns the weirdest projects. Luckily it's an easy A with little work outside of class, but you'll have to have a lot of patience."
5201,2381606,1.0,2.0,"All she does is scream. The whole class. Doesnt give clear criteria and doesnt grade quickly or accurately. All we do in class is extra credit and she has never said where it will be going. Again, just screams the whole time. Reads off powerpoint the whole class. Screaming."
5202,2381606,4.0,1.0,Amazing professor! TKI 2413 was a very fun and easy class. She gives you clear instructions and only grades you on listening to those instructions. The art projects are super fun. She can get stressed a bit if everyone is trying to ask her questions at once so you just have to be patient with her. Would highly recommend!
5203,2381606,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors. She always makes you laugh and cares so much about her students. Since it's such a small class, she does well with getting to know her students. Wouldn't recommend missing a day though. She will keep you working the whole three hours for the first half of the semester, but it gets a lot more laid back in the end."
5204,2381606,2.0,2.0,"She is a easy grader, but its because she isnt a good teacher. She makes you feel stupid for asking questions, but is easily offended. Easy A, but don expect to learn anything"
5205,2381606,5.0,2.0,"Never been good at art, but she does not grade on how it looks, she grades on your effort you put into the class."
5206,2127662,2.0,4.0,"Reads off the slides; dry lecture style. Level of theory required for homework is average; hope you can translate math. First homework assignment isn't right? Prepare to fail the entire class. Each assignment is a continuation of the last and he will NOT distribute an actual solution, only code snippets that often contain indexing errors."
5207,2127664,2.0,5.0,"Tests were mostly reused problems from homework/in-class examples. While that was helpful, the curriculum led me to reconsider my major. Not much to say about the teacher herself; she mostly just read the slides out loud."
5208,2127666,5.0,1.0,"Class is super fun & interesting! You learn about psych & app/web design from a UX perspective. Class is graded on a group project, but it goes by fast. You may spend extra time outside of class on your project. Attend every lecture & the tests will be easy. Tests have extra credit & there is an optional extra credit assignment. You will get an A."
5209,2127666,5.0,1.0,"The easiest class you will ever take. I finished my class with an average percent of 102. Just write sth down, you'll get marks for it. Exams are so so easy, even if you take a look at the slides couple of hours before the exam, you'll get an A. Tests only include new chapters."
5210,2185014,3.0,1.0,"Nunley is not a bad professor but he has minimal effort.  He was very lenient, but almost too lenient. All lectures were from a different professor and not done by himself.  There were very minimal grades in this class so if you get a B on just 1 exam then you better hope you get a 100% on the other one.  Yes, there was only a midterm and a final. "
5211,2185014,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, he is so understanding and if you care he cares. He is very nice and gives you extra points if you do well on attendance. He is great.. 10/10 recommend taking his course. Easy tests as well as long as you study the given material"
5212,2185014,4.0,1.0,Super chill. Just do the review questions and kahoot before the test.
5213,2185014,5.0,1.0,Intro to world geography  easiest class I've taken. Lectures are pretty boring and he post notes and test questions online so don't bother going to class. I went to like 5 lectures total and made A's on every test. oh... and he is NOT ugly.
5214,2185014,5.0,1.0,"This man is a GOD. He gave us candy during class, let us listen to music during tests, and was just overall an awesome teacher."
5215,2185014,5.0,1.0,"Easiest class I've ever taken. I finished with a 100 average. Test questions are spoon-fed to you the class before test day and are mostly common knowledge. Some people will say his lectures are dry, but he actually tries to work humor into his lectures. If you are in need of another social science, take this class!"
5216,2185014,5.0,2.0,"Professor Nunley is the chillest professor I've ever had. He is a great guy who really knows his geography. His class is definitely an easy A and his tests are mainly on quizlet. He will straight up tell you not to buy the book so DON'T BUY IT. He gives some extra credit and is very lenient about attendance. TAKE HIM, you won't regret it"
5217,2185014,5.0,1.0,"What a guy!!! Tests are just like the review and responds to emails super fast. Class is super easy, if you want an easy a take this guy!!!"
5218,2185014,5.0,3.0,Love love love love love this class and Dr. Nunley. Just read the PPs and reviews and you'll do well.
5219,2185014,5.0,1.0,"This class was the best thing that ever happened to me lol. EVERYTHING besides exams are online and attendance is not mandatory! You DO NOT have to buy the book either we literally didn't even use it. he gives you a study guide with the exact questions as his exams, if you make a quizlet of it and study it, you'll more than likely get an A."
5220,2185014,5.0,1.0,Easiest class I have ever taken. I took my midterm in 5 minutes. The study guides are very similar to the tests. He gives extra credit for attendance but it is not mandatory. I would highly recommend taking him for Geography. There are online quizzes and 4 tests that are multiple choice.
5221,2185014,5.0,1.0,"Literally just took the midterm in 5 minutes and have never felt more confident about getting a 100. I nearly failed out last semester so that is saying something. You are never in the class longer then 30 minutes, Attendance is not required, he posts all lectures on his website, study guides are similar to test, easiest class I've ever taken."
5222,2185014,5.0,2.0,Neat class. Some of the history content gets boring. He likes to talk about weather.
5223,2185014,5.0,3.0,"Class was cool. He posted the PPs online, which is nice. Tests are multiple choice."
5224,2185014,2.0,1.0,"Professor Nunley is a nice guy. Intro to Geography was an easy A, but his lectures will put you right to sleep. He simply reads the power points and gives everyone time to write it down until he goes to the next slide. Attendance doesn't count and he posts lectures online. Not a hard class or professor, but not an enjoyable one either."
5225,2185014,5.0,3.0,Mr. Nunley was the DUDE!
5226,2185014,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Nunley was very helpful. As long as you attend class, you should do well; he's fair, yet informative."
5227,2127674,4.0,5.0,"He does an alright job teaching the material, but if you want to actually master the class you will NEED to study it a good bit. Hes also really late grading, you wont know if you are failing or not until after you cant drop the class with a W."
5228,2127674,3.0,3.0,"Dr. Perkins is a nice person all together. However, his teaching methods did not sit well with me. He posts lectures you have to watch before class and its difficult to remember to do them."
5229,2127674,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic professor for Formal Languages, lectures are very informative. He posts all slides online with video explanations to go with them. Most of class is doing examples to elaborate on the chapter slides. Weekly homework and quizzes and only two tests aside from the final. He has a great sense of humor and I would definitely take him again."
5230,2127674,5.0,3.0,Great guy. Would take again.
5231,2127674,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Perkins made Discrete interesting and he wants to help you. Although the material may seem sporadic and not connected, he goes over exactly what you need to know for quizzes and tests. Go to his office hours! He is super helpful and is ready to help you with any concept you don't get. 10/10 would take again."
5232,2127674,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Perkins makes a class like Discrete understandable.  Discrete should be broken up into multiple courses, just because of the breadth of material and seeming lack of connectivity between the outrageous amount of concepts thrown at you. Dr. Perkins is very accessible outside of class - take advantage. Lenient grader, but content is difficult."
5233,841552,1.0,3.0,"For a class that is 1 hour a week, he gives an unnecessarily large amount of assignments."
5234,841552,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Moore is one of the best teachers I have had at State! He cares about his students and is always willing to help. Dr. Moore is reachable outside of class and gets back pretty quick. This class is group project heavy, so make sure you pick a good group. This class does require hard work, but I learned so much!"
5235,841552,1.0,3.0,Does not teach anything within a reasonable understanding
5236,841552,1.0,3.0,"Fails to teach actual process of problems, Runs through information extremely fast"
5237,841552,4.0,3.0,"This class is a lot of WORK! He will try to weed people out at the beginning. Learned ALOT though, so it was worth the work."
5238,841552,4.0,2.0,Cool guy. Interesting class.
5239,841552,4.5,3.0,"Good class, very fun and educational"
5240,2463582,1.0,4.0,Her class is so boring. She reads from a powerpoint the whole time. She grades very harshly and does not like her grades or behavior (such as her extremely slow grading) questioned. I do not recommend. 
5241,2463582,1.0,4.0,"Rude, unprofessional, defensive, and stubborn."
5242,2463582,3.0,3.0,I liked Dr. Lindsey but her lectures all sounded the same. She grades really tough and takes a long time to grade. She is so sweet and really cares about this class though. I would recommend her class for sure but we did a lot of presenting. She loves when people participate as well. 
5243,2463582,3.0,3.0,She was decent but was very lecture heavy so it was hard to focus at times. She is also really big on speaking in class when she asks questions. 
5244,2463582,1.0,3.0,I am sorry but I just did not enjoy this class. The teacher was rude and took long to grade assignments. The material is boring and all she did was read the lectures word for word. 
5245,2463582,5.0,4.0,"This class was very interesting! Dr. Lindsey is very caring and wants you to succeed. She makes class fun. She has high expectations but makes her standards clear for all assignments. She is very accessible outside of class. Go to her office hours!! There is a lot of group work. Beware of the indoor learning project, ask questions!"
5246,2463582,3.0,3.0,Sweet lady but she grades hard and gives a huge group project that will likely bring your grade down at the end of the semester. I finished with an 89.8 and she didnt round it up.
5247,2463582,5.0,2.0,Dr. Lindsey is literally the sweetest professor. She is very understanding and she is quick to reply to her emails if you have a problem.
5248,2332511,5.0,1.0,"The sweetest lady in the whole world. If you can take her, TAKE HER. She is an amazing teacher and you can really tell she cares about each and every student. Favorite professor I have had at Mississippi State."
5249,2332511,5.0,2.0,She is amazing!!! If you turn in an assignment late she is very forgiving as long as you talk to her about making it up. Understands college kids and you can tell she cares a lot about her job. I have her for English comp 1 Super easy class will also take her for Comp 2.
5250,2332511,5.0,1.0,Mrs. Street is an excellent professor and she cares about her students. She is flexible with papers and grades well. Would definitely take again.
5251,2332511,5.0,2.0,Show up and put in the effort and itll be an easy A
5252,2332511,5.0,1.0,I loved Mrs. Street's class! You can tell she truly cares about you and how you feel about assignments. She is extremely flexible with due dates and will help you in any way she can. I highly highly recommend!
5253,2332511,5.0,2.0,"THE best comp teacher on campus. Flexible due dates, gives more than enough time on assignments"
5254,2332511,5.0,2.0,"I LOVED Mrs. Street. She is so compassionate about this subject and also with her students. Her class was a breath of fresh air. She graded on effort of your work and didnt nit pick every little thing that might be wrong with your essays. She always makes you feel better about yourself. If you put forth the effort she asks, you will easily be fine."
5255,2332511,5.0,2.0,I loved Mrs. Street! Shes so sweet and understands if you cant turn in a paper on the due date. Shes funny and so caring of her students. Easy grader. 10/10 would recommend.
5256,2332511,3.0,2.0,Mrs. Alisha was very bubbly and interacts with her students a lot. She fell behind on grading papers which made it hard to edit drafts due soon after the last but other than that a very easy class.
5257,2332511,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Street gives such good feedback on every paper you turn in. She's also pretty relatable and tends to give lots of pop-culture references to help her students understand how to write a certain kind of essay. Super sweet and I wish I could recommend her enough for Comp 1! She makes her class easy for freshmen, but kind of babies them."
5258,2332511,4.0,1.0,"English: PAPERS!!!! Super sweet teacher, easy class, easy grader, easy A. She works out an outline for every essay, but kinda babies students."
5259,2332511,4.0,3.0,"Sweet, understanding, and lenient."
5260,2332511,4.0,2.0,I took Mrs. Street for Eng Comp 1. She is very sweet and loves when you come to her for help. If you are fairly good at English you'll do fine.
5261,2332512,5.0,2.0,"I took Mr. Smith for College Algebra. He was in the process of earning his doctorate will teaching my course. But that didn't stop him from being nice, explaining everything thoroughly, and making sure everyone's questions were answered. He would stay behind for a few minutes after each class so if you wanted to ask a question privately you could."
5262,2406242,3.0,2.0,"I have mixed feelings about Inkoom. This class is all lecture which can get kind of boring. However, because it is only Survey of Physics, it's pretty easy. He does a lot of examples. He lets you know ahead of time about homework and tests, and test dates are also on the syllabus. There are four tests plus exam and homework a for every chapter."
5263,2406242,1.0,5.0,Horrible teacher. Lectures are nothing like the test. Very hard to understand with his accent and mask. Do not take this class
5264,2406242,2.0,5.0,"Inkoom is a nice guy, but with his broken english AND speaking through a mask, going to lectures is just not worth your time. I could only last 2 months in the class before I had to withdraw because I was not going to pass his class. Take physics at a junior college, or if you're stuck with him, stick with the textbook and material provided."
5265,2406242,2.0,4.0,Mr Inkoom is a g just a dude trynna stack up bread you feel me. His classes were boring as shit. Put in effort to explain concepts but falling short with unclear explanations. Towards the end of the year he got a clean cut so I looked forward to going to class
5266,2406242,1.0,1.0,Very hard to understand and his online curriculum never works. Overall worse class experience. Got a horrible grade bc of his style if teaching a weird slides. I passed bc of a tutor. Im an all A and B student. 
5267,2406242,1.0,5.0,Don’t take him.
5268,2406242,1.0,4.0,Professor Inkoom made no attempt to form any personal relationships with his students this semester. This made it very hard for me to find the course work interesting and meaningful.
5269,2406242,1.0,5.0,Very hard to understand through a mask. Just works problems on the board the whole class with no real explanation of concepts. 5 question tests in a rushed time block. Make one tiny mistake and you can kiss your partial credit and decent grade on the test goodbye. Wouldn't meet for in person office hours and would only do Webex call.
5270,2406242,1.0,4.0,"Honestly, take Physical Science with a different professor or at a junior college. Multiple people in my class, including myself, had problems with the website that the homework is on. When we asked him about it, he basically told us to figure it out. He barely teaches and the class is more self taught than anything."
5271,2406242,1.0,4.0,"Not to be dramatic, but truly the worst professor I have had at MSU. He barely uses canvas and makes you go to class to find out when tests are and most of his announcements. I have found him to be very confusing when I know the work should not be that hard. My classmates would agree with me on this. I also found him hard to understand."
5272,2406242,1.0,3.0,"Inkoom seemed like a good professor based off his ratemyprofessor reviews, but he has completely changed since then. Does not grade fairly or how he describes in syllabus. Ridiculous lectures that dont answer students questions. No review or prep for tests. Im sure he might have been good in the past, but not anymore. Take elsewhere."
5273,2406242,2.0,3.0,"Not the best professor at conveying course information, and took time to grade many assignments. Made the final out of 120 points rather than 100, which screwed up a lot of students grades. Would not take again."
5274,2406242,5.0,4.0,not the best at explaining the more complicated topics but he is a good professor and human being
5275,2406242,2.0,4.0,"The physics department at State is terrible, just take physics at a junior college - you've heard that many times, but wanna find out why everybody says that? Take his class. I'm sure he's not a bad guy, he seems nice, but everything about his lectures and teaching style works against any and all actual understanding of this difficult subject."
5276,2406242,5.0,4.0,"Calc based physics 1 is a challenge anyway. Must read, prepare &amp; practice the hw problems a lot - regardless of professor. Dr. Inkoom was very good with explanations and available outside of class. Responded to email. Expect to be very detailed when writing out your answers on exams. You have to write every step. Gives partial credit &amp; Xcredit"
5277,2406242,2.0,4.0,The first test is kind of a freebie because he gives you a direct study guide but rest are very difficult. He doesn't really give you any direction on what to study and learning the material well is very difficult in this class. A on first test F on second. Online because virus after that
5278,2406242,1.0,5.0,"He is the worst professor I have had at Mississippi State. His teaching style (if you can even call it that) barely contains any conceptual information or reasons for why you work problems a certain way. He simply works random problems on the board without any explanation. This class is 100% self taught, and 80% of the homework isn't even taught."
5279,2406242,1.0,5.0,"It is obvious that he doesnt care if we pass or fail, or if we have to pay to retake. His lectures and tests are too complicated and he is pretty difficult to understand. He seems to think the struggling is funny. He is a smart guy, doesnt relate to non-math students. He is teaching English, Art &amp; History majors. I recommend taking elsewhere."
5280,2406242,2.0,4.0,"I registered for his class based on his amazing reviews on RMP. Unfortunately, he changed the structure of his class entirely. He no longer gives review problems and when asked what to focus on for exams he basically tells you to &quot;just study everything.&quot; This was a very rough class and has only fueled my desire to take General Physics II elsewhere."
5281,2406242,2.0,5.0,"He's a nice guy and is okay at teaching physics, but his tests and grading are absolutely horrible. He is a VERY strict grader that gives almost no partial credit. Be prepared to receive 1/15 points on a problem if you don't want to beg for more points during office hours. He also doesn't convey what information needs to be known for tests well."
5282,2406242,2.0,5.0,"Physics at MSU kinda stinks. If you HAVE to take it here, maybe Inkoom should be your second choice. He's a decent guy, but the testing doesn't reflect the teaching. I've mainly had to teach myself everything. Even after asking the professor for help, there still is some confusion."
5283,2406242,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor he really cares. Held help sessions for each test. Gives study guides very similar to actual exams. Grades within a reasonable time frame. Very easy to talk to and an all around amazing professor. He also gives formula sheets for all of the exams. Truly was a blessing.
5284,2406242,5.0,4.0,"He's a great teacher for physics. The department itself sucks but he goes the extra mile to help you in class and outside of class. He'll give you a study guide for the first 3 tests and the homework reflects on what you learned, it's not a waste of your time either. I wish he could teach Gen Physics 2"
5285,2406242,4.0,3.0,"he gives a practice test for test 1, 2, and 3, but for the final there is no practice exam. you have to look over your old test and study those. you do not have to go to class but he gives test back during class and if you go to his office to get then he will ask your excuse for not getting it during class. easy professor and makes the class easy."
5286,2406242,4.0,2.0,"The tests are almost exact copies of the study guide. So make sure to go to class the week of the test, because that's when he goes over it in full detail. The homework can get quite difficult but its not that bad if you pay attention in class and write everything down."
5287,2406242,4.0,2.0,"Really great teacher, tests are almost exact copies of the test review sheet given in class."
5288,2406242,3.0,2.0,"The class ain't really hard because the exams are almost carbon copies of the study guides he gives you. I would avoid this class if you want to learn the conceptual side of physics that deviates from plugging and chugging numbers into equations since that's what his tests and lectures consist of. Btw, sit in the back bc he likes to call on people."
5289,2406242,4.0,4.0,"He is a really carrying Professor and really nice, homework is confusing and sometime difficult. However, if you pay attention in his lecture the test are manageable. On the test make sure you work the tutorial it is similar but do not memorize it that wont help. Lastly, don't expect to get out early it is a bell to bell kind of class."
5290,2258786,5.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. Lemley! I had him for Animal A&P. Go to class, he does give assignments from time to time for participation points. He explains things well and never leaves you guessing as to what will be on the test. Also always posts slides. His quiz questions are always on the test too."
5291,2258786,4.0,3.0,I loved him. Very good professor and made things interesting. Only graded on 4 tests and 4 quizzes. Final is just test 4. go to the lecture. gives some in-class assignments.  
5292,2258786,5.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. Lemley! He's not a boring lecturer and his quizzes and tests are very similar to what we discuss in class. You have 4 quizzes and 4 tests in the semester and whatever was on the quiz, would be on the test (pretty much word-for-word). We also had extra credit opportunities with playing Kahoot in class and some grade curves!"
5293,2258786,5.0,3.0,Absolutely love Dr. Lemley. His lectures are amazing- he really explains everything in great detail in a way that you'll understand &amp; will stop for any questions to make sure everybody gets it. He has fantastic jokes &amp; really made a&amp;p not so miserable. His exams are exactly what we learn in class and he really cares about you passing. Amazing prof!
5294,2258786,5.0,4.0,"He is a great professor, even in the online setting! He makes the lectures as interesting as possible, and the discussion assignments and lab assignments are FUN. During lab, he is extremely helpful in our learning when we have questions or want to further understand a topic."
5295,2258786,4.0,4.0,Great teacher. Highly recommend. he make lectures as interesting as possible.
5296,2258786,5.0,5.0,Loved professor Lemley! He has interesting extra credit questions on his tests so listen to his little stories he tells.
5297,2258786,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Lemley has easily been one of my favorite professors at Mississippi State. He is entertaining, his lectures are good, and he is extremely helpful in answering questions both in & out of class. Gives great study guides. If it's on the guide, know it!! Extra credit in lecture & lab. 5 lecture tests, weekly lab quiz & a cumulative lab final."
5298,2332516,1.0,1.0,Dude will talk about anything but kinesiology 
5299,2332516,1.0,4.0,Such a waste of time. Various professors in the department rotate out lecturing all semester. The tests are a joke. It's impossible to study b/c the professors don't stay on topic and the book doesn't follow what you are learning in class. Your grade is based off of exams(majority) and 2 pop quizzes. Pray that someone made a quizlet for exams!
5300,2332516,1.0,5.0,This class is awful. The tests have nothing to do with the information given in the lectures. You only get graded on four tests the entire semester and a few pop quizes. The professor says he will not answer email in the beginning of the syllabus so good luck getting ahold of anyone. you are expected to read huge chapters in the text order to pass.
5301,2332516,3.0,3.0,Fundamentals of Kinesiology was fairly easy as long as you pay attention. Each day a new professor lectures so it keeps the class interesting. The tests are based off of the slides. The random pop quizzes will hurt your grade if you make a 0.
5302,2332516,2.0,3.0,"This was by far one of my least liked classes of the semester. Communication with instructors was awful, lectures are all over the place since it's rotated throughout the department, and pop quizzes are just randomly given. I was sick throughout the semester and tried to get in contact with the instructors but never once received a reply."
5303,2332516,1.0,4.0,Doesn't test you on the same information as the lectures. Book chapters are 50+ pages. Never stays on schedule and never knows what's going on. Very arrogant and very boring.
5304,2332516,3.0,4.0,Lectures are done every week by a different professor in the department. Tests are based off of the book occasionally but mainly from lectures. Lectures are so long and boring to watch depending on who the teacher is for that module. I did not enjoy this class.
5305,2561890,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Neuenfeldt knows that most people are only taking art history because they need an elective or whatever, but she genuinely tries to make class fun and exciting. She provides literally EVERYTHING you need to know for exams. Not a hard class at all."
5306,2561890,5.0,3.0,"She gives you everything you need to know and can make class interesting. If you study, it's an easy and fun A. If you skip class and don't study, you can easily fail."
5307,2561890,3.0,3.0,SHE GIVES A TON OF EXTRA CREDIT!! So attend every extra credit event she has. I did not take written notes only took pictures in class and passed with an A. She talks so much so be prepared. She grades test at a reasonable time. She doesn't cancel class. Attendance is mandatory! Final Exam is easy if you study. Study vocabulary words for the final.
5308,2635628,3.0,4.0,"There is a quiz and discussion board every week and they will take you forever to do. Lectures are long and boring. Assignments, such as, papers have no clear outline and can be pretty confusing. He never answers emails, but he is nice so I'll give him that."
5309,2635628,2.0,5.0,"He is a hard teacher and slacks on grading in a proper time frame. (Like all students he will learn.) He is very unclear on the assignments and waits till a week before something is due to let us know what he wants. You have to email him and asked him what is he looking for, so you are aware and don't mess up. Would I take him again, no."
5310,2635628,1.0,4.0,"Mr. Campbells assignments are sometimes confusing and he takes weeks to grade them. Fingers crossed you do the assignments right because he never responds to emails. He grades pretty hard, considering theres no clear outline on most assignments and he doesnt add many comments on the assignments he does grade."
5311,2529138,2.0,1.0,"She is an okay teacher. She definitely loves the material, but she comes off as very boring and static with her lectures. She tries to engage the class, but it doesnt come off very well. Would probably do better with a class that all are majoring in this topic versus a freshman class with a variety of majors that dont really care about the topics"
5312,2529138,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Lyons has been one of my absolute favorite profs at MSU. She's hilarious and always so caring and reachable. Class can be a little boring at times, but I would take another class of hers if I was still at MSU. She is very passionate about the material! I would recommend her to anyone and everyone."
5313,2529138,5.0,1.0,"Ms. Lyons was a fantastic teacher. If you need to take this course, definitely take her. She makes the class interesting and gives you plenty of materials before tests. Pretty easy A."
5314,2529138,5.0,2.0,"It's clear that Mrs. Lyons is passionate about what she's teaching, and it definitely rubbed off on me. At first, I was not looking forward to her class, but her lectures were engaging and the material was all pretty easy. Her tests are very straightforward, and she's very clear about grades. Would definitely take from her again!"
5315,2529138,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Lyons is the best professor I have ever had. She is so passionate about what she teaches and she cares so much about the class and the students. I genuinely looked forward to coming to her class. amazing
5316,2529138,5.0,1.0,She is the best teacher I have had on campus. She gives out doodle notes for us to fill out to sum up what is taught in class. We played games to review for tests and the final. You only have like one assignment a week.
5317,2529138,5.0,2.0,The best teacher on campus! She provides doodle notes to summarize her lectures. She is very caring and wants her students to do well. We play games a lot in her class to review.
5318,2529138,5.0,2.0,"Honestly, this woman loved her job more than anything in the whole world. She immerses herself in the lecture and makes sure the students understand what is going on at all times. She makes examples that are easy to connect in the future. I took the final in about 20 minutes because the way she teaches sticks in your head! She also brings rocks!!"
5319,2529138,5.0,2.0,"Karly Lyons is a wonderful instructor. She has a passion for teaching and she truly cares for her students. Attendance isnt mandatory, but its advised that you show up. Lectures can get boring; although, she makes it interesting by bringing her rocks, minerals, etc. to give examples."
5320,2529138,5.0,2.0,She really cares about her students and tries to make lectures as enjoyable as possible. We played games and got into groups to review for tests. Quizzes were due at the end of some weeks and took like 10 minutes to do and tests were easy if you came to class and studied the &quot;weekly 10s&quot; she gives. Amazing Teacher 10/10!
5321,2529138,5.0,3.0,She is really sweet. Mrs. Lyons provides a lot of information on her lessons that helps tremendously on the exams. She really great at explaining topics and provides great notes and power-points to her students. I would absolutely recommend taking her class to anyone.
5322,661367,5.0,4.0,"Mrs. Moore is an amazing teacher! Although her tests are long and difficult, she gives you lots of opportunities to get extra credit. She is also very easy to reach outside of class and a very understanding teacher when it comes to extenuating circumstances. "
5323,661367,4.0,3.0,"This class is pretty easy if you study a lot. Attendance is not mandatory, but you will earn extra credit at the end of the year if you are under a certain amount of absences. She also gives bonus points out during some lectures. Her lectures are long and full of information. I would take it again, but it definitely wasn't my favorite class. "
5324,661367,4.0,3.0,"Professor Moore is a great teacher who really cares about her students, however, her lectures take up the entire class time and she rambles. I would encourage those to take her who go to class, and are willing to do the many assignments of homework. She gives out extra credit during class time, for those who attend. Tests are not hard."
5325,661367,2.0,3.0,"Make sure you take a look at dates on these reviews. Previously, her tests were online, and her final was optional. Well no longer. Her tests are doable, but are made harder than they should be. Tons of assignments. They open up by module though, so you can do them pretty early. In class assignments almost every class."
5326,661367,1.0,2.0,"Worst lecture class I've been too. Shouts at you with the volume at 11. Expects you to be as excited about marketing as her. If marketing is your reason for living you will like this class, if not- Guaranteed headache after each class. Required $100 online access code to do 3rd grade level HW. In addition 500 person classes should not exist."
5327,661367,5.0,2.0,"Favorite Professor at State! She makes lectures fun, which is important considering it's the entire class. The tests are very straight forward, if you study, you will do well. Assignments are open as soon as the new unit starts, and aren't due until the day of the test."
5328,661367,3.0,3.0,"She is very nice and energetic. Definitely knows her stuff. Get ready for a mountain of homework, 4 long tests, and a comprehensive final. LOTS of material. She does in-class assignments so make sure to come to class. She did not give us studyguides."
5329,661367,1.0,4.0,only cares about herself
5330,661367,3.0,1.0,"She is super nice and energetic. It can be a bit much sometimes but she means well. Do NOT miss class, her attendance policy is strict and she has in class assignments for points nearly every five mins. Her tests are difficult but very similar to the study guides."
5331,661367,4.0,3.0,Pay attention during the lecture because some test questions come from examples in class. The study guide is very helpful for the test.
5332,661367,4.0,2.0,"This class was an easy A. There were only a few things we were graded on which were tests and weekly assignments on MyLab. There was an opportunity for extra credit we had all semester to complete. All in all, this was an easy class from a professor that taught me a lot."
5333,661367,4.0,3.0,Easy class. Should be an easy A. Just pay attention to lectures or powerpoints.
5334,661367,5.0,3.0,"This class is not hard, but it does require studying if you are not actively participating in class. Dr. Moore is a great professor who's lectures are entertaining. She gives plenty of bonus points so don't miss class. The final is also optional which is a plus, and you have all semester to do the online assignments."
5335,661367,3.0,3.0,"She teaches with a lot of enthusiasm and there's nothing wrong with that,but she can get very annoying because she will move slow through two chapters then cover two chapters the day before the test. There is a lot of self-teaching in this class. Her tests are ridiculously hard but she does give out tons of bonus points. If you take her be prepared"
5336,661367,4.0,4.0,Test be hard But she gives extra credit
5337,661367,4.0,2.0,"Shes really enthusiastic and quarky(in a good way). Shes gives almost 30 points in extra credit, great professor and never a dull moment during her lecture."
5338,661367,4.0,2.0,"This class, to me, was an easy A. If you show up, take notes, and study the powerpoints, there is no reason you should get lower than a B. She does make MarketingLab a requirement, but she even said herself it should be an easy 100. Also, she gave 30 bonus points from in class assignments and chapter review sheets. I would highly recommend her."
5339,661367,3.0,4.0,Be sure you know her style of teaching compared to her husbands. Her husband doesn't require the marketing lab to be completed but she does and it weighs heavily on your grade. She is overly enthusiastic about marketing but gets annoying after about 3 lectures. She chases rabbits fairly regularly so try to keep up. She is a fun teacher though.
5340,661367,4.0,4.0,Shes super cool
5341,661367,3.5,3.0,At the beginning of the semester I was excited.  Then her enthusiasm got old and quite annoying.  She loves marketing but I soon discovered that it's all targeting and deception.  Never a dull lecture (for her).  Makes you wonder how many lines were snorted before class sometimes.
5342,661367,5.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. Moore! I took her my first semester at State for Principles of Marketing and she's very enthusiastic about the class. She gives plenty of opportunities for bonus points throughout the semester which really help your final grade. There were 4 tests and our final was optional, but it replaced your lowest test grade if you took her! :)"
5343,661367,4.5,2.0,One of the best teachers I had. took her for Principles of Marketing in the Spring. Very enthusiastic. don't take attendance but advise you to attend cause her powerpoints are not the same as the ones on mycourses. Her tests are multiple choice. just study the slides and her examples and you will be good to go.
5344,661367,5.0,2.0,Great professor! She doesn't take attendance but its best to attend. Because she gives random bonus & alot of questions are covered in class & not on power points. The bonus add up to your final grade. & power points are heavily relied on to pass exams.
5345,661367,4.5,4.0,"Despite  I`m an international student , I didn`t have  any trouble with the course.She has a clear teaching and she provides lots of opportunities to get bonus points(they really helps to boost your final grade).After taking this class you will have a better understanding about marketing.I  exactly recommend her !!!"
5346,661367,4.5,3.0,Dr. Moore is an incredible teacher I think. She really does a great job of explaining and teaching the material. She gives many examples that help you understand what she is talking about. She also offers many bonus point opportunities throughout the semester. And they add up in the final grade. I would definetely recommend her!
5347,661367,2.0,5.0,she misses a lot of classes..tests are fairly difficult..
5348,661367,5.0,2.0,Dr. Moore is very energetic and so helpful!
5349,661367,4.5,3.0,She has a very unique way of talkin. Her classes are normally interesting.
5350,661369,2.5,1.0,Easy class. She has no idea what she is talking about dealing with a resume. There is more than one way to do a resume. She will fail a resume that has previously been approved by the career center. It's her way or nothing. Real nerd too.
5351,661369,3.5,2.0,"Organized communications is a farely easy class, but go to class to get the in class assignments"
5352,661369,4.0,2.0,No Comments
5353,661369,3.5,4.0,"She can be cool @ times, but she's also kinda geeky."
5354,1308543,2.0,4.0,Textbook is required in order to do well on tests.  Class is fun when you go into the lab and make food-then taste it!
5355,1308543,3.0,1.0,"An easy class, though I didn't learn a whole lot about cooking I didn't already know.  It's a fun 1st year seminar, there's not much work, and you get to eat."
5356,1308543,3.5,3.0,Class was challenging but she was a pretty good teacher. Definitely read the book and use it to help study. Class attendance is important because she gives a lot of extra credit. Try to catch her right after class if you have questions because appointments are hard to make.
5357,1308543,4.5,1.0,"For her Freshman Cooking Class, it was the easiest class ever. Just show up and eat food."
5358,1308543,1.5,5.0,She was AWFUL! Did not help at all when I needed it.  Tests are very hard.  She would make appointments with multiple students at once.  Do not take this course with her!
5359,1308543,4.0,4.0,"Tough class. A lot to be learned. Exam 3 was by far the most difficult exam in my college career yet. Best advice: READ THE TEXTBOOK! Also attendance is not required, but she offers many opportunities for extra credit which make a HUGE difference on your grade. Over 200 students in class, but she makes time meet,and answers emails quickly."
5360,1308543,4.0,1.0,I had her for freshman seminar- Cooking Basics: Iron Chef Bully. GREAT class!! Each week we would cook differnt foods. And got to eat what we cooked each week! What's better than that!&#63; This class was super fun and I would recommend any freshman to take it!  :)
5361,1308543,2.5,4.0,"Was NOT helpful AT ALL! Very disorganized, always made multiple appointments with different kids in the class."
5362,1308543,1.5,5.0,THE HARDEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKING WAS HERE NUTRITION CLASS
5363,2635648,5.0,4.0,This was an online class and Dr. Fugate lays out expectations for you. Do the work in a timely manner and do what is expected of you an you will be fine. I enjoyed the online lectures and he is always accessible by email or zoom. I do recommend NOT waiting until the end of the semester to start on the PLDP. It is intense and a lot goes into it. 
5364,2635648,5.0,4.0,"He has very high expectations, but they are not unreasonable. He is this way because he wants everyone to actually learn the material. It is very different from any other class because he does not give actual tests, but I believe the way he teaches and does assignments I have truly learned the material."
5365,2635648,5.0,4.0,"The class required some work but was manageable. 2 group papers and an final project, plus weekly reading/quizzes and 4-5 written assignments to turn in. The final project took a lot of work, but is applicable and will have immense value for your professional development. Folks complaining on this site didn&#39;t put the work in. "
5366,2635648,1.0,5.0,"Terrible. Grades are not clear whatsoever. I had a B in the class on canvas, but he failed me. I received no concerning email or message about my course standing. If you have any kind of anxiety, get ready for panic attacks because he calls on random people. Then if you don't answer how he wants you to, he makes you feel stupid for it. AVOID HIM!!!"
5367,2635648,5.0,3.0,"Highly applicable. Great supplementary videos. Will Zoom/take calls. Whole group Zoom helped for Final (cumulative) project. Posts ex. for guidance, super helpful. Final project - self generated ProfDevPlan. Better than any employer has ever done 4 me! Syllabus is your bible. FOLLOW IT! Not a self paced course. Work due weekly. Great instructor!"
5368,2635648,5.0,3.0,"Took class in a very challenging environment- COVID-19/social distancing- and changing rooms he tried to make sure he was heard and we were heard. Not his fault the venue sucked/was hot. He he tried getting everyone in the game. He expects you to do your work,*come prepared* and to *PARTICIPATE*. Follow directions and look at examples he provides."
5369,2635648,1.0,3.0,"By far the worst teacher at state I have over had. Has to be at the center of attention. When having discussions in his class if you do not have the same thought as you he will berate, and be little you in front of everyone."
5370,2635648,1.0,5.0,"This professor was terrible. He was incredibly unorganized, he made the class harder than it necessary, and he doesnt post regular grades so you never know where you stand. Also, once you are in a masters course group assignments seem so juvenile. At this point, people can work with others so no, I shouldnt be graded on anothers lack of effort."
5371,2635648,1.0,3.0,"very unorganized, you never know what's going on in the class and when stuff is due. I wouldn't recommend him at all."
5372,2635648,1.0,3.0,"Changes assignments days before their due date, horribly unorganized and if I learned one thing from the class he exemplifies the pseudo-transformational leadership style. Do not take him if you don't have to, half the class had to appeal their grades due to his poor teaching abilities."
5373,2635648,2.0,3.0,"He is disorganized, to say the least. The material was not hard, but he would often change instructions or assignments halfway through. It was difficult to know what we need to do for assignments because of changes and instructions spread out everywhere. No grades posted so don't know where we stand. Makes things more complicated than necessary."
5374,702336,5.0,1.0,The best Choir teacher ever!
5375,702336,5.0,1.0,No Comments
5376,2635650,5.0,3.0,She is super sweet! I took her for intro to study of language and the class was super easy. She gets students to engage in class and her lectures are interactive most times. The assignments included very short papers and the tests were easy because we studied over the material through the week and did practice sets before tests. I highly recommend!
5377,2635650,5.0,2.0,"In my academic career (including high school), professor Angelo is one of the most welcoming and helpful professors I have worked with. She is super helpful and is very easy to reach out to. It's a shame she cannot teach every single course I take; she's that great of a professor."
5378,2635650,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Carolyn Angelo is a sweet and kind professor. The class is easy, we only have to write papers in the class, but you do need to buy the 3 textbooks! Essays are easy to write if you know what you're doing. Just pay attention to what you're writing about. Overall, great professor."
5379,2635650,5.0,1.0,I took her for comp 1. She is an amazing teacher and is really understanding to her students. There are only 3 big papers due a semester and she gives back great feedback.
5380,2709388,5.0,2.0,Dr. Lynn is great! I had him for water resources and I learned quite a bit! His tests are very fair and the homework is helpful to learning the material. Highly recommend taking at least one of his classes before you graduate! 
5381,2709388,5.0,3.0,Dr. Lynn is the best teacher to take for any Civil Engineering course. He is really funny and makes each lecture entertaining and engaging. He is very fair. His tests are composed of variations of in-class and homework problems. I would recommend him to anyone and have thoroughly enjoyed learning about Environmental Engineering.
5382,2709388,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Lynn is my favorite in civil engineering at MSU. He actually wants students to learn and enjoy it, so he makes lectures engaging by cracking jokes throughout and is very helpful. He assigns little homework, and his tests follow lecture material to a T. He allows a one-page formula sheet on tests, so as long as you take notes you'll succeed."
5383,2619276,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Speights is very nice, cares about you as a student, and responds to emails quickly, but does not offer much grace. Be sure to cross your t's and dot your i's. It will cost you a letter grade. I took an online class and lectures consisted of TED talks and other YouTube videos. More entertaining than a lecture but not what I pay tuition for."
5384,2619276,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher EVER. She doesn't teach at all and expects you to know every chapter and section of the book verbatim. You get 2 &quot;quizzes&quot; each week consisting of 2 questions worth .35 of a point as an &quot;extra credit&quot;. Then your exam will be everything under the sun that you didn't cover. Not to mention she doesn't post useful videos,only the amoebas."
5385,2619276,1.0,4.0,"Only tests count, different kind of teaching ways."
5386,2619276,2.0,5.0,get another biology teacher luv.
5387,2619276,1.0,5.0,"Essentially the only grades we had were 4 exams, so if you didn't do great on those there was no way to redeem yourself. The mean for each exam was a D, and she didn't curve them. She offers some extra credit, but its nowhere near enough make a meaningful impact. She was really bad."
5388,2619276,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Speights is a great teacher. I had her for an online class, so that made it more difficult. The lecture videos she posts are really good, and they give you a good idea of what is going to be on the test. I would recommend!"
5389,2299803,5.0,1.0,This man helped to turn my life around. Dr. Proffessor Byrnes took his own time to take me into his home literally since I had no place to stay. He has the heart of a lion as well as the best professor that I have ever have. I highly recommend taking his class.
5390,2299803,5.0,2.0,10/10 gave me A+ when I let him eat my sandwich.
5391,2299803,5.0,1.0,11/10 love this man I failed just so I could take him again.
5392,2299803,5.0,1.0,"Was so nice to the class, felt as if we were family. He has no faults. We've even started watching anime together."
5393,2299803,5.0,1.0,I wish this beautiful man taught every class on campus so I could be in his presence all day
5394,2299803,5.0,1.0,"This man is a god among us. Sir Mr. Doctor Professor Byrnes has changed my life. Any time I was struggling, he was always there to help. 11/10 would take again. I actually didn't do a single assignment for the last half of the semester in the hopes that I would fail and get to take Sir Mr. Doctor Professor Byrnes's class again. #worthit"
5395,2299803,5.0,1.0,"The best professor at Mississippi State University. I would definitely take Byrnes again. He is very coordinated, explains every assignment, and does a fantastic job overall. He is a legend here at Mississippi State University. Great professor. Five out of Five would recommend."
5396,2299803,5.0,1.0,He changed my life. I don't know what I would have done this semester without Professor Byrnes' guidance.
5397,2299803,5.0,1.0,DR. BYRNE IS ALL
5398,2299803,5.0,1.0,Professor Byrnes is my hero
5399,2299803,5.0,1.0,He rode into class on a white stallion. 420/10 would hand in assessments again.
5400,2299803,5.0,1.0,"What a guy! You wont find a more caring and entertaining professor at this school. I would take Mr. Dr. Professor Byrne for every class if I could. The most important thing to know before taking one of his courses is to use &quot;x's&quot;, rather than filling in the oval."
5401,2299803,5.0,1.0,This man is amazing
5402,2299803,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Doctor Professor Byrnes is the single best thing that has ever happened to MSU. Absolutely stunning work, it's a real pleasure to watch him lecture."
5403,2750364,5.0,3.0,"Is a very sweet, caring teacher, but there are many assignments and due dates that change making it a bit jumbled. Grading is based on 5 IPA's (tests ability to read + 1 drop grade), Mindtap work, 11 quizzes (1 drop grade), 8 Conversifi's (1 drop grade), 2 tests, 1 final project."
5404,2635681,4.0,4.0,Dr. Boone is one of those professors that want to you to be prepared for a career. He teaches real-world relevant material. His group projects are pretty hard and he will literally try to tear apart every point of your presentation. I would definitely recommend speaking to him outside of class if you are starting to look for jobs.
5405,325540,3.5,4.0,"Decent teacher.  Her homework can be long and tedious but it helps you during the exams.  She works many example problems during class which is helpful.  Yes tend to be a bit heavy on math, but more conceptual than is taught in lecture.  I would have taken her for Chem II had she taught it. P.S She is not good with computers"
5406,325540,3.5,3.0,"In my opinion, Dr Debbie Beard is an excellent chem 1 teacher. She works out lots of examples in class and will work with you outside of class if you need addition help. Her class isn't an easy A. But it's college. What do you expect. Don't miss more than three days, do the homework, and you'll be fine. "
5407,325540,3.0,4.0,"Not a great teacher, but okay to talk to. All her tests are multiple choice so they're not too bad. Be ready to be lost in labs (she doesn't teach at the speed labs go), and her online assignments are numerous and time consuming but not always hard."
5408,325540,3.0,3.0,"She mostly just read off the powerpoints instead of actually teaching. However, if you were confused about something, she was always ready to help you. Her tests were difficult, but not impossible. Overall, she wasn't an awful teacher, but she wasn't a very good one either."
5409,325540,1.0,4.0,Professor Beard is quite possibly the worst professor to ever walk this universe. She doesn't explain the subject well and often rambles on about irrelevant stories. The tests are difficult but not as difficult as the Online Homework. I didn't purchase a textbook and I do not regret that decision at all. * You WILL be teaching yourself!*
5410,325540,3.0,4.0,She cant teach that well. She just read off the slides and you have to teach yourself. Her exams are hard so study. She will not curve the exams except for the final.
5411,325540,3.0,3.0,She just reads off the powerpoints all class. Doesn't actually teach anything.
5412,325540,3.0,4.0,"I hate chem, but Dr. Beard she doesn't make me hate it even more, so that's a good thing.  She tries to make chem fun and interesting.  Her notes are posted online, but I find it helpful to record her lectures for later reference, because she tends to work out extra problems on the document camera."
5413,325540,4.5,4.0,Excellent teacher for Intro to Org Chem! Learned alot had to study but she makes it interesting!!
5414,325540,4.0,3.0,AWESOME TEACHER! Gets information across well and will help you out any way she can. A lot of people don't like her classes because they are chemistry classes but she makes the best of them and does a great job teaching! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5415,325540,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Beard is very organized, but her tests are hard and she gives alot of OWL HW. She gives a drop grade, but because her tests are so hard it doesnt really help out alot."
5416,325540,3.5,1.0,"Nice and funny but not a good teacher.  I had AP Chem in high school so I knew most of it already, but if you haven't had chemistry before, don't take her.  She has funny stories though, and the notes being online is very convenient."
5417,325540,3.0,4.0,"I didnt like how she had the power point in class and really didnt spend much time explaining the subject. She flew by the chapters. so if you didnt get it once, it's up to to understand it.....OH...and she is not funny at all!...her jokes are not funny"
5418,325540,2.5,4.0,"The most frequent comment I've heard about her, from other students, is cold. She's HARD, and so are her tests. DO NOT GET ON HER BAD SIDE!!! She is very easily offended so be careful."
5419,325540,2.5,3.0,"puts a power point on the internet.  tells us to download it.  reads straight from it in class.  and can't do the problems herself.  NOT GOOD.  i can't figure out why i keep going to class.  funny, but not a very good teacher."
5420,325540,5.0,2.0,One of the best teachers I have ever had.  She explains the material well and she cares whether the material is being understood or not.
5421,325540,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher. She makes class fun and educational. Her test come strait from the book. If I could have her for all of my chem classes, I would."
5422,325540,5.0,4.0,Dr. Beard is an awesome teacher. She is so helpful and she makes it a point ot make the class fun and try to relate all the info to everyday things! She makes it fun to come and learn!
5423,325540,5.0,3.0,Very helpful in learning Chemistry.
5424,325540,5.0,3.0,"She gave us a test with word problems (no scantron) and let us pick which ones to do.  I think it had 11 or so questions, and we picked maybe 6 or 7.  She really tried to help us get a good grade."
5425,325540,5.0,3.0,She is very helpful. She wants everyone to do their best in the course and helps them as much as possible.  I learned a lot.  She explains things as many times as needed. She provided extra credit opportunity.
5426,2430893,3.0,5.0,"I love Dr. Jessop as a person, not a professor. I hate the idea of a flipped class, especially for a course that is so difficult to understand with ordinary learning. It is a 4 hr course, so she has well over 100 assignments. Its textbook heavy and theres a big project. She does work magic though. I failed all of my tests and came out with a B."
5427,2430893,4.0,3.0,idk I liked her. probably just me but I like the flipped class too but did wish we did some learning together as a class. office hours are your friend. the project made no sense to me. you have to use your textbook to do every problem
5428,2430893,1.0,5.0,"a teacher I would not wish on my worst enemy. She heavily has her favorites, and if you are not one of them, good luck. Endless assignments that do not help, tests are nearly impossible. Go to class and GO TO OFFICE HOURS. That is your only fighting chance if you are looking to at least pass."
5429,2430893,1.0,5.0,"the worst experience of my life. i have never felt like I was drowning in work, but I suffocated in her class. You work 30+ hours a week.  shes a hard grader, she answers questions with questions and overall caused me my mental breakdown and anxiety attacks. do not take her ever. she ruined my semester. TAKE THIS CASS WITH DR. PEARSON OVER SUMMER"
5430,2430893,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely aweful professor. If this is the only class on your schedule, you would be doing 10 hours minimum a week. Office hours are optional, but if she doesnt see you there and you fail the test, youll fail the class. If she sees your face often, and you fail a test, you will pass the class. Seems illegal. She dont care. Avoid her altogether."
5431,2430893,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Jessop is going to assign more work than all of your other classes combined. If you are a transfer student this class will be even more difficult. She does tutor outside of class, I was there plenty, did not help. The class requires you to read the book for full understanding but you will never have time to do that due to endless assignments."
5432,2430893,1.0,5.0,This is a flipped class (teach yourself). I learned by watching the videos she posted that are almost decades old. Dr. Jessop gave over 180 Graded Assignments that dont weigh nearly as much as the tests which dont reflect class work. She answers questions formlessly or with another question. We finished the entire book expeditiously. Avoid Class!
5433,2430893,2.0,5.0,"Shes the only one teaching the class right now so I had no option but to take her and it has been the most miserable semester of my life. Tests are graded inconsistently based on if she likes you or not. She assigns way more work than youll ever have time for that's barely any percent of your grade. But, she's so nice and really helpful and caring"
5434,2430893,1.0,4.0,"Sooooo many assignments. Counted over 170 that barely matter. Tons of homework, most of which is extremely difficult. Tests are not graded consistently. Flipped classroom."
5435,2430893,1.0,5.0,"She assigns way too much work in class that there is not enough time for. The classwork not finished becomes homework on top of the homework that is assigned. She doesn't teach, so you must teach yourself most of the material. If she is still teaching when you take it, be ready to buckle down because it is a miserable semester."
5436,2430893,1.0,5.0,Nothing
5437,2430893,1.0,5.0,"She doesn't teach at all. This is typically people's first time taking anything like Mass and Energy that is very problematic. She says that you won't have a lot of homework out of class, but she always plans more problems than you'll have time for. Therefore since this is a flipped class you have the reading, left over classwork, and hw to do."
5438,2430893,1.0,5.0,"Bad notes, unrealistic expectations, difficult homework, few worked examples, test did not reflect material, and extremely hard grader. She wanted us to learn over 30 different student made power points in addition to her own (Not slides full power point presentations) Honest warning: Avoid her classes at all cost"
5439,2430893,1.0,5.0,Run faster.
5440,2430893,1.0,5.0,Run
5441,2430893,1.0,4.0,"She is rude when you ask questions, assumes you know everything, gave us 174 graded assignments that amount to 15% of our total grade, is inconsistent in grading, and when you ask questions, asks you the same question or is vague."
5442,2430893,1.0,5.0,"Very terrible. Her class feels like I can skip it and not miss anything, but you miss several graded assignments. She has a flipped class and that makes learning more dependent on your group. She doesn't lecture, and a lot of learning has to be done on your own. I don't feel like the class should be hard, but how she conducts class causes it to be"
5443,2430893,1.0,5.0,"Literally the worst teacher I have ever had. If I could have given a negative rating I would have. Our class has had 150 assignments this semester. If you are ever unfortunate enough to have to take her, good luck. You will need it."
5444,325551,5.0,1.0,Prof. Mylorie is the best!
5445,325551,5.0,3.0,great job at being there for students
5446,325551,3.5,3.0,"Mrs. Mylroie is extremely passionate about what she teaches. There is a map quiz every week which isn't too hard if you study for it. The tests are a lot harder than I imagined they would be, no matter how much you study. I would recommend her, but don't take her class expecting an easy A."
5447,325551,5.0,2.0,"This was my favorite class at MSU.  If you take this class, you MUST take it with Mrs. Mylroie!!!"
5448,325551,4.5,4.0,"Mrs. Mylroie was extremely helpful. Although you do have to study, the class is interesting. She does everything in her power to help you understand geography."
5449,325551,4.5,5.0,"Mrs. Mylroie is the sweetest teacher I've ever had. She's a lot of fun and clearly loves what she does; however, her tests are SO hard and there is a lot of memorization required. If you can't memorize (especially maps, climates, winds, etc.), don't take her class. If geography is your thing, you'll love her."
5450,325551,4.5,4.0,she is a good teacher come to class and take notes and find a study buddy. buy the old edition of the book. you only use it twice the whole year but you do need it both times. go talk to her ask for help. study for your tests but have fun. she is extremly funny and class is never boring. i would take her again
5451,325551,5.0,1.0,"This class was really easy!  Mrs. Mylroie is a very funny lady who will do anything to help you out.  She dresses up almost everyday in a costume from another country.  The map quizzes and tests are both multiple choice and easy, if studied.  I reccommend Mrs. Mylroie to everyone."
5452,325551,5.0,1.0,Mrs. Mylroie is a great teacher. She is the best teacher by far I have had this semester.
5453,325551,5.0,2.0,She is the best teacher I have ever had!! She's funny and really knows what she is talking about. Plus she's been everywhere and dresses up everyday.
5454,325551,2.5,3.0,No Comments
5455,325551,4.5,3.0,"Somedays she's a ninja, other days she is a pirate. She dresses up almost every day in some costume.She is very funny. A few questions on the tests come from the blue. Very specific on the tests. Gives extra credit so you can get an easy 16 points.The map quizzes are 20 questions and easy if studied"
5456,325551,4.5,3.0,"take notes and come to class and yo'll do fine, she really knows her stuff"
5457,325551,5.0,1.0,"Her class is very, very easy.  She gives plenty of extra credit.  If you are looking for a class that you won't have to spend too much time on then take hers."
5458,2135990,3.0,2.0,"I don't feel very strongly about Brittany either way. She's young, a little inexperienced than most of the other professors in the department, but she is talented. She wasn't very critical of student work, and I personally never really felt challenged in the class. Maybe she will hit her stride soon as an educator."
5459,2135990,5.0,1.0,"She is an incredible professor. She is young and relatable. She is the 1 of the most helpful professors in the entire art department! She will bend over backwards to help you, even after you've left the class. Very reachable if you have ?'s, even late at night! Super sweet, talented, and VERY HELPFUL as long as you show interest. RECOMMEND."
5460,2086849,3.0,3.0,"This class wasn't really that bad, but it took weeks or months to get grades back on work so it was pretty much impossible to keep up with your grade in the class. And I took the class online. I would NOT recommend Mosley."
5461,2684885,4.0,4.0,"Dr Street is confusing to me. His lectures are great and he makes them fun and the material easy to understand. He always advertises that he is available outside of class but most of the times I have went to his office, he made it seem like he didn't want to help. He is kind of unapproachable. There is A TON of work for this class too."
5462,2684885,5.0,4.0,"I LOVE Dr. Street! If you are given the opportunity to take his class, do it! Not only is it extremely helpful for research, but he's just an overall great human being! I have never in my life had a professor/teacher to care the way that he does about his students, their learning, and success! You have to work for your grade, but its worth it"
5463,1759189,4.0,3.0,"She is a great teacher for Design 1. On the projects you are able to put your techniques in, she allows you to and does not try to change your style.  Very quirky and is very genuine.  You will be expected to redo some projects but it does improve your grade."
5464,1759189,2.5,4.0,"If you're looking for an easy A, don't take her! She requires you to read multiple chapters and take online quizzes each week. She only gives 2 tests (a midterm and a final) which are harder than necessary."
5465,1759189,3.0,3.0,"If you're looking for an easy A, do not take her for art appreciation! There are quizzes due online before each class, and she only gives 2 tests: a midterm and a final. Her tests are unnecessarily diffucult.Do not take this class!"
5466,1759189,4.0,2.0,"She's very helpful and loves to talk about your ideas for a project. She critiques much tougher than she grades. You will redo several projects, but she takes that extra effort into account when she grades."
5467,1832917,5.0,3.0,This guy is awesome. I had him for English Comp I and liked the class so much that I took Comp II with him. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Mear's.
5468,1832917,5.0,3.0,Mr. Mears was so awesome. He actually made writing fun. I totally loved his class. I hope he teaches creative writing in the future.
5469,1832917,5.0,3.0,"Nick is legit the best professor I've had so far here at State. I was in his Comp II class, and he's super laid back, and really relates with his students and cares. 10/10 would take again."
5470,1832917,5.0,1.0,Easy easy easy
5471,1832917,5.0,2.0,He was a great professor! He wants to help kids in life and in class. He is very understanding when it comes to kids these days. He helps tutor the athletes for Mississippi State so class might be canceled sometimes. Very laid back and chill but will get through the subject. The only problem is that it took him a while to give grades back.
5472,1832917,2.5,2.0,The class was ok and I did end up with a decent grade but I honestly felt like I wasted my time. This guy can be quite a jerk and the work was monotonous. I'd suggest you try to take with another prof.
5473,1832917,5.0,1.0,I absolutely love Professeor Mears! I would definitely recommend taking him. He even helped me clarify my major.
5474,1832917,5.0,3.0,"Overall,  Nick Mears was the best English teacher I could have gotten for English Comp 1. He was always available during his office hours, and would even dedicate time during class for students to come up and ask about their essays and he would help them to make it better. We never had very little outside reading and hardly ever took notes. "
5475,1832917,4.5,3.0,Thus teacher will respect your a written and he genuinely enjoys reading students papers. After each draft he was willing to sit and talk with you improving your style and papers. This is by far the best English teacher ever!
5476,1832917,5.0,1.0,Take this man! He's great!!
5477,1832917,5.0,3.0,He was great. Helped me a lot. Took time out of his day to make sure each and every student who wanted to learn understood the assignments. He gave me a second chance at writing.
5478,1832917,1.0,5.0,They do not allow me enough space to write my full opinion so I will sum it up in two words: Absolutely horrible. Avoid at all costs.
5479,1832917,5.0,1.0,Professor Mears is the best professor in history. Hands down. He taught me English.
5480,2684886,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Skarke is very passionate about oceanography and coastal environments. There is not much work, but the work is sort of long. Overall his class is pretty average. If you are going into anything regarding the ocean or coast, he's the professor you want to take. He genuinely cares and will help with anything he can."
5481,1685466,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher, really helpful. The class is hard because there is so much to learn, but he does his best to make it easy on you. Even lets you get answers wrong by a couple of letters without counting it. Knows his stuff from experience, and makes sure the informat is up to date. Can't wait to have him again."
5482,1185755,5.0,1.0,"This class was very easy if you just showed up. The grades consist of small, easy quizzes on canvas (MC), attendance (25% of grade), 2 easy tests (most answers from quizzes also MC), and a choice of 2 papers or 1 paper and 1 class presentation. Grading is very easy if you just follow directions. It is a very laid back class. "
5483,1185755,2.0,2.0,"Professor Crescenzo is not my favorite. Although she cancels class a lot, she is very unorganized and doesn't really follow a schedule. She also inputs her opinion about certain things into class, which makes the room awkward. She has a good personality, but for a professor I just feel like she could be more helpful. She barely gives out homework."
5484,1185755,3.0,3.0,"honors comp II is a pretty easy class based on one research question of your choosing. She is a super easy grader and lenient with due dates, but you will have to deal with her sarcasm and bluntness. If you have thin skin or want specific instructions take another teacher. If you want to laugh and work on your own a lot, she is great."
5485,1185755,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Crescenzo is a great professor. She is a little disorganized, but is very lenient about some subjects. As long as you proofread and actually participate, you will do fine in her class. I took her for honors English 2."
5486,1185755,4.0,2.0,"As long as you do your work and read what she assigns, you'll be fine. Her tests are pretty easy, and she only assigned one formal essay the whole class. She provides extra credit opportunities as well. Unfortunately, she's often incredibly slow when it comes to grading assignments, so keep that in mind. Easy A for the most part though."
5487,1185755,4.0,2.0,"One of my favorite profs freshman yr. She gets off topic frequently, a little unorganized, &amp; doesn't use canvas very well. But tells jokes &amp; makes material make sense. Easy A with little work Complete assigned reading bc: 1. 25% of overall grade is based on participation in class discussions 2. Pop quiz style free writes based on assigned readings"
5488,1185755,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Crescenzo is great! She is super considerate &amp; will work with you. She's easy to reach outside of class &amp; tries her best to make class interesting. She doesn't grade super hard as long as you give your best effort. She is big on class participation though so make sure to do the reading. If you're taking Eng Lit After 1800, she's a solid choice."
5489,1185755,3.0,2.0,"I took Dr. Crescenzo for English Lit before 1800. It was online and was relatively easy because you didn't have to show up or participate in class. I never really talked to her personally because I had no issues. I wouldn't recommend Dr. Crescenzo for online if you actually want to learn, but if you're looking for an easy A she's fine."
5490,1185755,4.0,2.0,A solid choice for intro into literature. She does not overcomplicate the class but does sometimes confuse herself and tell us all different instructions. She is understanding and will work with you if you need help. Tests are not too complicated but you should still study.
5491,1185755,4.0,2.0,"She seemed intimidating at first, but once you get to know her she's a pretty chill teacher. There is a TON of reading in her class. Her tests are fairly easy, but there are a couple of lengthy papers throughout the semester."
5492,1185755,1.0,4.0,"She takes a long time to grade things. She wants class participation, but gets mad when you say something she doesn't understand. Is rather unorganized. The quizzes are easy. She grades essays tough. I would not take her again."
5493,1185755,5.0,2.0,"I hope you have a good sense of humor. She can be sarcastic but it's all in good fun. Go to class and participate in discussion it will be part of your grade. Overall, easy class as long as you do the work."
5494,1185755,1.0,5.0,"This was the worst class I have ever taken. It requires SO much writing and an insane amount of reading, it's not terrible to keep up with class work but if you don't read one thing you are screwed-and it's a lot. We have an 8 page paper due for the final and another 4 page essay due on the exact same day. DO NOT TAKE HER PLEASE."
5495,1185755,3.0,1.0,"Really pretty easy, but make sure you pay attention in class."
5496,1185755,4.0,2.0,"Took for Honors Comp 2. Only had 3 essays but she was very generous grading. Also gave people extra time to turn in essays. Textbooks are required. Most classes were spent doing kind of useless exercises out of the textbooks. Other than that, good professor who cared about the subject."
5497,1185755,5.0,2.0,"My favorite teacher this past semester! Such a nice, funny lady. She is just a very interesting person all around. Sometimes late to grade, but I didn't have too much of a problem with that personally. Reading the books is very important though."
5498,1185755,3.0,4.0,"She was okay. She can be a little unorganized at times, but never bad. You will not have tests, just two essays, reading quizzes, and a presentation. It is an interesting class, but I didnt love all of her reading choices, but thats just me. Most of what I learned was from other students in the group discussions."
5499,1185755,2.0,4.0,"Worst teacher I have ever had. She is the most disorganized person I have ever met. If you ever have a question, don't expect her to give you a straightforward answer. Expect her to take forever to grade anything!"
5500,1185755,4.0,3.0,"Wonderful. She is a social justice warrior from beginning to end, and in her World Lit class, you can see it through the reading she assigns. We discussed relevant topics in relation to early literature. She is willing to debate with you respectfully about her beliefs. If you don't like that, she is not for you. Very fun and thought provoking."
5501,1185755,4.0,2.0,She's a great professor and she knows how to effectively teach the material!
5502,1185755,4.0,1.0,"One of my favorite teachers.  This is one class I never mind going to.  You can tell she loves English and Literature, but she understands that everyone does not and doesn't force it on you like most teachers do.  She has a sense of humor and always lets class out early. "
5503,1185755,3.5,3.0,"She's a tough grader, but she does give you multiple chances to do drafts and get help. She is always there if you need her and her classes are super small. It's a wonderful class and I highly recommend taking her for Comp II or Accelerated Comp II. The only thing is she takes a while to get papers back to you."
5504,1185755,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Crescenzo is GREAT! She loves what she does and is very passionate about Literature. Also, she is absolutely hilarious which makes the class really fun. She is not a hard teacher, but you will learn everything you need to in her class. If you have the opportunity to take her, do it!!!"
5505,1185755,5.0,2.0,"Crescenzo is by far the best teacher I've ever had, I learned more from her than any other EN teacher, I think whoever had her in 08 is a little high on themselves. I'm pretty sure if a dozen people like her and you don't then there isn't something wrong with her, theres something wrong with you."
5506,1185755,5.0,2.0,Very nice professor. Really enjoyed her class. She enjoys what she does and makes it enjoyable for the class. If you can write at all and show up for class you'll get a good grade. also do the reading so you can take the easy quizzes!
5507,1185755,4.5,4.0,I loved Dr Crescenzo's class. I didn't think it was too easy or too hard. She was spunky and kept us on our toes. She allowed for free discussions in class which I enjoyed. I would definately take her again! She has a flair for life and for literature that you don't always find. This lit class was not boring at all. I highly reccomend her!
5508,1185755,5.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. Crescenzo!This was the best class I've had in a long time! Essay assignments are hard, but she is a lot of fun. You write summaries of reading assignments in class for daily grades. I would definitely take her again."
5509,1185755,5.0,3.0,Wonderful literature selections. Great discussion. Funny & keeps interest.
5510,1185755,4.0,4.0,"Although she is inappropriate at times, that's just her personality. She was a great teacher and really felt like she tried to get to know the students. I would definitely take her again."
5511,1185755,5.0,3.0,I loved Dr. Crescenzo's Class. She was very interesting and extremely funny. I really looked forward to going to her class everyday. If you do the assigned readings and take notes in class you should do just fine. I would take her agian.
5512,1185755,5.0,3.0,She is a great teacher. She makes class interesting and not so boring. She is super understanding and helpful.
5513,1185755,1.5,1.0,"Dr. Crescenzo is easy, but completely inappropriate every day in class. Class is boring, we never finish covering anything, and she doesn't post or grade things on time. She talks about her friends' sex lives, politics, and cursing - none of which are appropriate for a classroom. If you love English, don't take her - you'll be bored to tears."
5514,1685468,5.0,1.0,So hot.
5515,1685468,5.0,1.0,"Can't stand lateness or disrespect, but is a great teacher. Takes role regularly, and uses dry humor to lighten the mood. While quizzes are a departmental requirement, she tries to make it a smaller part of the grade. Read the book! Highlighting during class is the best way to take notes. Easy teacher."
5516,137181,1.0,4.0,Most terrible teacher in history.
5517,137181,5.0,4.0,"rEALLY HARD, BUT YOU LEARN ALOT.  USES METHOD OF ASKING QUESTIONS SO THAT YOU LEARN THE CONCEPTS."
5518,137181,5.0,5.0,Really good if you want to learn.  Best I've ever had.  But don't take if you don't want to work and learn.
5519,137181,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely daft when it comes to teaching, she doesn't even seem to have any common sense.  I wouldn't be upset at a bad grade on assignments...if she had actually taught us the lesson. Not to mention she's 15-20 minutes late for every class, even on test days (where she'll come in unprepared,  and try to hand copy missing parts of students' tests)"
5520,137181,1.5,4.0,"The worst Professor I have EVER had at MSU! She does not teach the subject in a way that the student learns properly, and does encourage questions for learning. Suggestion; Do not take her class if it is at all possible!"
5521,137181,1.5,3.0,Worst professor ever. when she lectures she just stands at the board and mumbles so basically she cant teach. dont ever ask her a question because she will tell you that she explained everything already. the only thing about her class is that her tests are multiple choice and she gives extra credit every now and then
5522,137181,2.0,1.0,If you've had calculus before and just want an A then take her. Otherwise find someone else. The people in her class who haven't had calculus will guarantee you an A in the course because she has to give loads of extra credit on her already easy as pie tests to keep most of them above a D. The record for my class was 140 bonus points...
5523,137181,1.5,5.0,She makes this class hell!!!
5524,137181,2.0,3.0,Isn't good at answering questions posed by students.. makes you feel stupid for opening your mouth
5525,137181,3.0,5.0,"Had her for Cal II and Cal III. Do yourself a favor and steer clear. Only reason I took it twice was because tests were multiple choice. Which you can expect as well but don't mistake for easy. Been teaching since the Cretaceous period. Long story short mean as a snake, old as dirt, and class is tough as nails."
5526,137181,2.5,2.0,"Hard subject, hard class, average-ish professor.  Do not talk back to her.  If you do she will ruin you stuff."
5527,137181,1.5,3.0,Her lectures are very confusing but the tests are fairly easy.
5528,137181,1.0,5.0,"If you have never taken Calculus before, you will be lost the entire semester."
5529,137181,2.0,4.0,"Had her for Cal 3 and it was horrible.. especially at 8am. I agree with most people here, she knows the subject, and that sis obvious, but she can't convey it effeciently in a classroom. So yeah, she can't teach."
5530,137181,1.5,4.0,"She knows what she is talking about, but she just can't teach.  No matter what other people tell you don't take her class."
5531,137181,1.5,4.0,the worst teacher i have ever had.i feel like im smarter than her
5532,137181,1.0,2.0,"A disgrace as a teacher.  I got an A because I ignored her and taught myself from the book.  She knows what she is talking about, but she can't teach.  The only thing that makes up for it is that her tests are amazingly easy."
5533,137181,1.5,3.0,she sucks
5534,137181,4.5,4.0,"i really appreciate mrs. okhuysen now.  i am a math prof, and after 20 years i realize just how good she is."
5535,137181,2.5,3.0,No Comments
5536,2635748,5.0,2.0,"I took her for abnormal psy, and she is a really good professor. You can tell she is really passionate about the course. The lectures are good and really interesting. You have a weekly assignment due on Sunday's, that is really easy to complete. She gives feedback on every assignment. The exams are 50 questions, a study guide is provided"
5537,2742251,3.0,1.0,"I couldn't understand half of what she said because despite being 20 feet away from every other person, she wore two masks during class. Every single assignment is utterly pointless and a waste of time. The class is easy, but the assignments are literally ""Describe how a plant affected your life"". Every. Single. One."
5538,2742251,2.0,1.0,"It is a lot of busy work. Freshman level course and she treats students like they know nothing about college however, she is nice. works seems pointless. "
5539,2742251,4.0,3.0,The labs are online and they suck. BUT the lectures were easy and the exams were too.
5540,2742251,5.0,5.0,"Mrs. Burkhead was a good teacher. I had her for plants and humans. Her lectures are power points, and she lets you have time to actually write/type all the notes before moving on. Didn't need the textbook. I hate science with a burning passion but she made it fun and enjoyable."
5541,2742251,5.0,1.0,Her lectures are super organized and directly reflect the test material. Tests account for most of your grade but are not difficult at all if you study the lectures. I spoke with her a few times after class and she seemed nice and super willing to answer all my questions.  
5542,2742251,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Burkhead is a great professor. She is very caring and will answer any questions/explain any topics to you if you need it. She makes the tests very straightforward and does extra credit. If you study the notes and pay attention, you will do fine. "
5543,2742251,5.0,3.0,"She was super nice and helpful, and as long as you show up and take good notes while using quizlets for the tests, the class will be a breeze. "
5544,2742251,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher! I took plant and human for an easy elective, and as long you study, you will be fine! The labs are kind of long, but it is all online, so they are not bad. Take plant and human for an easy elective. "
5545,2742251,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Burkhead is a good professor. Anything on the test is whatever she went over in lecture. She is a very fair grader and she cares about the material she teaches. She is pretty quiet during her lectures though, so if you are hard of hearing, sit near the front. Overall, I had no issues with her."
5546,2742251,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Allows you to set up appointments to review tests and is willing to help with any questions you may have. Tests come straight from the lectures and are straight to the point. Not much classwork, so average is made up of tests and quizzes, but weekly lab assignments that take less than 15 minutes to help bring your grade up."
5547,2742251,5.0,2.0,"great professor, took notes, made flash cards, and made a good grade. everything from class is on tests so theres no sneaky or tricky things."
5548,2742251,5.0,2.0,"She was a great professor. Literally have nothing bad to say. Lectures were simple and straight to the point. Tests were about anything say went over. She was a great professor. 10/10 would recommend. Also, the class was pretty easy. I have not one point complaint about her teaching. Would highly recommend."
5549,2521069,3.0,3.0,"This class isn't hard by any stretch of the imagination due to the lab being half your grade, easy tests, and unlimited quizzes. However, Bill lost me a week into the class when covid-19 was integrated into the lectures. Although its microbiology, its still a political topic that should be left out of lectures."
5550,2521069,5.0,3.0,"He's one of the best professors I've had, super funny and makes the material much easier to understand. I had him for a lecture and for a lab and in both he was extremely helpful in answering questions and made everything interesting. Definitely cares about his students and urges everyone to reach out to him if they need anything. Fantastic man"
5551,2521069,4.0,4.0,"Loved Dr. Bill. Makes jokes and relates lectures back to actual things that we know about so that we can understand what he is talking about . The material for microbio was pretty difficult, but he makes sure to explain everything really well and will stop for questions until everybody understands. Great professor and I enjoyed being in his class!"
5552,2521069,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Bill was great for gen micro. He was very friendly and made lectures fun. Attendance wasn't mandatory, but I highly recommend attending class to get an A. If you study the weekly quizzes, you'll do fine on the tests."
5553,2521069,5.0,3.0,"I loved Dr. Bill! The key to passing this class is definitely studying. There are weekly quizzes with unlimited attempts so as long as you know that material, it will 100% be on the test (sometimes word-for-word). He gives out plenty of extra credit opportunities in class and online. The lab is worth 50% of the total grade."
5554,2521069,5.0,4.0,"I absolutely loved Dr. Bill and looked forward to his lectures. You could tell he was very passionate, and he never made you feel dumb about asking a question. Tests are nearly impossible to pass if you dont study, and you have to know just about every detail of each organism. That said, all the info is in the slides."
5555,2521069,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors at the school. He's funny, enjoyable lectures, and makes it known that he will help with anything you need. There is a &quot;how is your mental wellbeing&quot; question on every test, he genuinely cares about the mental health of his students. You have to buy a notebook, but it's cheap and is all you need. Take him"
5556,2521069,4.0,4.0,"I found this class pretty difficult given the amount of material required to learn/understand and the fact that it was online. Tests were fairly hard due to this. Dr. Bill did seem to really care for his students and want us to succeed. Although, he was a stickler for the rules and was not changing his mind about that."
5557,2521069,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bill was honestly the best semester Ive ever had at MSU. He is really caring about his students, and offers many ways to bring up your grade. This class is somewhat difficult, but Dr. Bill laid everything out straightforward and made the class very manageable. The lab can be a pain, but it good to boost your grade. Overall, I would take again."
5558,2521069,5.0,3.0,"I took Parasitology during summer 2020 and it was online because of COVID. The amount of assignments (specimen drawings, quizzes, case studies) really helped me out, because I could do poorly on an exam and still be okay. Dr. Bill frequently communicated with us and seems like a nice guy who cares about his students."
5559,2521069,3.0,4.0,"He cares about his students and makes his self accessible outside of class. His class, however, is pretty difficult. You HAVE to work for your grade. Listen to his lectures and understand the material being taught. The main grades are the tests. I advise that you show up to class because there may be group assignments or polls."
5560,2521069,4.0,5.0,"His test questions are application based and near impossible. Extra credit and attendance points. I didn't make an A on a single exam but still got an A in the class. Lab is half of the grade and it is a lot of information, exams, and 3 practicals. He really cares about everyone's future though, and is a great person to talk to about career paths."
5561,2521069,3.0,4.0,"For his first year here he didn't do too bad. A lot of his lectures were slide-based and he does a lot of in-class assignments to check attendance. He tests vary from the slides, textbooks, and student-submitted questions. The study guides are somewhat helpful but you really need to go to lecture and his office hours to pass."
5562,2521069,3.0,3.0,The first 3 exams are difficult but exam 4 is extremely easy and a joke. I made a low B on first 3 tests but he gives an insane amount of extra credit points in class that it is super easy to get an A. So if you go to class and do the easy extra credit then you should be fine to get an A as long as you can make 80s on the exams and get a 90 in lab
5563,2521069,1.0,5.0,The tests were insane. The tests had questions that reminded me of the ACT. I studied so much and made low grades. The test questions were really hard to answer. The lab helped my final grade because it counts as 50%.
5564,2521069,1.0,5.0,Hardest class of my whole college career. Literally study and know every single thing on his slides backwards and forwards and still can't get above a 70 on a test. He really tries to trick you with the questions and you only have 50 minutes to take the test which is impossible to do with his hard critical thinking questions. Lab is fun though.
5565,2521069,1.0,5.0,"Welp, my gpa got messed up due to his mirobio class. I've tried everything, I've learned every slide, and I still am doing awful. After the first test, everyones grades were so bad and said he would make the test easier, he didn't and said it was the hardest one. His chapter reviews aren't anything, they don't help either. Run away, drop the class"
5566,2521069,1.0,5.0,horrible teacher avoid if possible I've taken lots of bio courses here and have never done this bad. I know it's his first year teaching. He told us after our first exam when we did bad he would help us out. what did he do? nothing just said the next exam would be easier. what did he do the next exam? he told us that it was the hardest in the class
5567,2521069,1.0,5.0,His ppts are so vague &amp; his tests are ridiculous. He will never prepare you to succeed. I study for his tests in each &amp; EVERY SINGLE WAY POSSIBLE. Still struggling on exams. I completed MSU Chemistry with an A &amp; am struggling in his class if that is any indicator of whether it's the prof or student dropping the ball. Give us Brandy Roberts back!
5568,1832952,5.0,5.0,"Dr. H is one of the best professors I've ever had. He explains concepts clearly and thoroughly and really cares about making sure students understand ideas and can apply them. He is an incredibly hard grader, you may not get a good grade, but you will learn a lot. He is a super fun teacher and you can tell he really cares."
5569,1832952,4.5,4.0,"Professor Hillesheim is a cool dude. He'll give you points for effort - hard work is rewarded, but what he really cares about is your comprehension. Lectures have a quirky, irreverent style, but I liked it."
5570,1832952,5.0,1.0,Awesome teacher
5571,1832952,4.5,5.0,Organic Chemistry was hard for me in general. Dr. Hillesheim's homework is not a very good representation of the material for the tests. Test questions are open ended and there are usually few questions. He gives partial credit and goes over tests. GO SEE HIM if you are struggling and he will do what he can to help you... Only reason I passed. 
5572,1832952,5.0,4.0,"I struggled with this class with another instructor, but Dr. Hillesheim was wonderful! He explained things in such a simplified way that I ACTUALLY learned the concepts and how the reactions worked. His tests come from the problems in the book and the online homework so pay attention to that. He is so nice and will answer any questions you have!"
5573,1832952,5.0,4.0,Doc H is SO HOT!!! You could bounce a quarter off his ass!  I would take his class even if I didn't have to.  I hate that he's married.  Oh well...
5574,1832952,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher that is willing to bend over backwards for students. If you attend, he will do everything in his power to help you pass. Lectures make Organic Chem seem to make sense and really prepare for Organic 2. Open ended tests are tough, but gives partial credit and will go over everything in office hours. Smart, funny, and relates to students"
5575,1832952,3.0,4.0,I had to retake this class and i had Hillesheim both times. The first time i didn't pay as much attention as i should have. I also did't really know how to study for it. Pay attention!! He is hard yes but he also tries to explain it. Know the concept of each thing and you will do well. You have to study! I would recommend him but you have to work!
5576,1832952,2.0,5.0,"This guy is horrible at teaching, reads from slides, then assigns owl homework, easily agitated. And yes if you have little past chm experience, stay away, cause he is a weed out teacher."
5577,1832952,4.5,2.0,"Patrick is an awesome professor! He is very helpful if you reach out to him. Of course you need chem experience for a college chem class, his is no different. Somewhat difficult, but you will do fine if you study and do the online homework."
5578,1832952,1.5,4.0,"This class was awful! He is not good at helping students, just reading the slide and spending too much time talking about concepts ""you don't need to know until (insert higher level of chem)"". It makes the class confusing and beyond frustrating. The tests and homework are hard, and he doesn't let you use a graphing calculator!"
5579,1832952,2.5,5.0,"He is a really nice guy and tries really hard to make the class enjoyable, but he goes too fast. If you have never had chem, then don't take his class. His tests are also only 25 questions long, multiple choice and are hard! He has never curved anything. I have never used the book, but you pretty much have to teach yourself through the online hw."
5580,1832952,2.0,5.0,"I may have to take this class again, I have a 3.2 gpa and this is my worst class. Reads from slides does one or two problems and treats the class as if it is the only class students take. Dont take him if you have no prior chm experience, dont take him at all you can."
5581,1832952,2.5,4.0,"He's a really nice guy, just not the best teacher.He goes through power point slides and practice problems too quickly. He also assumes you know a lot of stuff already. His tests are around 25 questions but are super hard. He's happy when the class average is a 70."
5582,1832952,2.0,5.0,"Dont take him, high expectations for what little info he gives. Test 1 ave was 70 and he was happy about it, if you fall behind he'll make it even harder on you. IF you are a non-chem major take someone else. MY main point is,for a intro class he takes it to far."
5583,1832952,2.0,5.0,"Dr Hillesheim might be a good teacher after he gets a few years in. I took this SummerB and organized all the study groups, studied his practice problem min 4 hours a day and 6 days a week. the first two test, tutors couldn't do them, but the third test came after the last day to drop with a W, and it got easier. he barely curves ACS stay away!!!!!"
5584,2734074,5.0,1.0,He's very caring for student's success and an enjoyable professor.
5585,2734074,4.0,4.0,"Overall, Kory was a solid choice for abnormal psych - he's really knowledgeable and genuinely cares about his students and their performance in his class. Lectures can be a little boring. Extra credit given throughout the semester, but he's not a pushover; go to class (and read your book) and you'll be very prepared for the assignments and exams."
5586,2734074,4.0,3.0,Kory genuinely wants students to do well. He tries to show educational videos and other resources to help reinforce the material he is teaching. His lectures can get a little boring because he reads off the slides but overall he is very caring and helpful. He responds to emails in a timely fashion and is also generous with extra credit.
5587,2447357,1.0,3.0,"This might be the worst professor ever. Soyoun Lim's incompetence knows no bounds. This professor thought that an out of class group project which included making and running a sporting event from scratch could be done with no notice, hardly any teaching, and very little knowledge of the course material. She also bashes the student afterwards."
5588,2447357,1.0,3.0,This has been my worst class experience.  She seems to be uninformed and is just as surprised to see the slides in her presentation as those in the class.  The slides in this grad course are as basic as the slides I had in a high school marketing class. Her class involves a class run event which she sabotages at every turn then blames the students.
5589,2447357,3.0,4.0,"She only gives two test, midterm and final. Attendance and participation are averaged together at the end of the semester and is a grade."
5590,989189,4.0,4.0,"Took her for engineering stats 1 over a Maymester. She was very nice and helpful, and the class itself was not difficult to understand. But the way she words her test questions makes it very hard to understand what youre trying to find. Overall she is a good professor."
5591,989189,5.0,3.0,She is one of my favorite teachers. Cares a lot about students and tells funny stories from time to time as well. The work wasn't that bad and she always is available outside of class if you do need help. She also gives extra credit randomly from time to time!
5592,989189,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, really cares for her students and how well they are learning the material. Tests are fair and lectures actually help learn the material"
5593,989189,4.5,3.0,"Very passionate.  Follow her instructions on assignments and exams, and you will have no problems.  Don't be late to class!"
5594,989189,1.5,2.0,"She was nice, there,I have said something good about her.  The best description of her teaching was that it was very poor.  She worked a minimum number of problems, and when asked with why she only used powerpoint slides to teach from, she responded with ""That is how I teach the on-line class.""  Well, I didn't sign up for the online course, did I?"
5595,989189,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Strawderman is one of the better teachers I've ever had.  Super nice, super polite, and ALWAYS willing to offer help.  She's tries her best to make sure all students comprehend the material.  Her in class examples are very straightforward and she assigns just the right amount of homework."
5596,2684942,5.0,2.0,"He is pretty laid back. You are allowed 5 absences, after that it counts against you. His lectures are very long and kind of boring but if you can get through them you will be fine. 1 homework assignment a week usually. Not a bad class"
5597,2684942,2.0,2.0,Dude is mid AF
5598,2684942,2.0,4.0,"He lectures from the minute you walk in to the minute you leave. Be ready to study. Also homework doesn't pop up on canvas, so you have to manually keep up with the homework assignments. Attendance is mandatory. He doesn't ever stop talking. Tests aren't easy. Be ready to study. "
5599,2684942,4.0,2.0,Easy if you go to class and take notes.
5600,2684942,2.0,1.0,"He's definitely a pretty easy professor and you can get an A in his class for minimal effort. I found his lectures pretty boring, but if you just need the grade and are willing to stay awake for 2.5 hours a week, he's your guy."
5601,2684942,5.0,1.0,"Super easy. Pay attention and have basic common sense, and you'll easily make an A in this class."
5602,1587216,1.5,4.0,"Very old guy.  Very sweet and nice but honestly it is time for him to retire.  He can't hear really at all, his lectures are aimless, unfollowable, and quite often he stumps himself and stares at the board.  Tests were unreal.  In short Everything I learned was self taught, and the massive curve saved me and pretty much everyone else in the class."
5603,2390032,5.0,2.0,Ms. Thomas was the bomb y'all. She knows her stuff and is so caring. All the Covid stuff happened after spring break and she emailed us to make sure we were okay and to see if we needed anything. Her class is the only one I missed having in person. She put extra credit questions on every exam and the final is optional. Take her class!
5604,2390032,5.0,3.0,"I loved my class with Ms. Thomas. She really cares about her students and gives a lot of extra credit. She gives points for showing up to class and puts extra credit questions on every exam. She is funny, dry humor, but very sweet. I am switching my major after taking this class with her. I would definitely take another class of hers."
5605,2390032,5.0,3.0,"I had Ms. Thomas fall of 2018 and she is now a TA in another one of my classes and she is awesome! She is funny, a little sarcastic but she gave tons of extra credit and even gave extra credit if you show up to her office hours. She also helped me with things outside of class. I would legit take another class with her."
5606,2390032,4.0,3.0,"Class was good. She posts lectures online and has videos. The tests were fair and she dropped the lowest exam and quiz scores. A lot of extra credit points for participation and sometimes just for showing up to class. She was fair, funny, and a bit sarcastic but warm. Just make sure you attend, especially review days."
5607,2390032,4.0,4.0,Relies heavily on her powerpoints which are always available online. I recommend printing them out and taking notes as she goes through the powerpoints and write anything she says that isnt already in the notes. Her class was interesting and she was very sweet. Easy class if you take the time to write notes and study them.
5608,2390032,5.0,3.0,Great instructor gave lots of extra credit. I learned so much and would take a class with her again!
5609,2390032,2.0,4.0,"You have to teach yourself most of the material. She lectures heavy from the powerpoint. Also, she's very strict and by the book about attendance, emailing her, etc. The material isn't that hard, but her teaching methods don't help matters."
5610,2390032,2.0,4.0,"She is one of the rudest teachers that ive had at State!! If you take this class, YOU MUST GO EVERY DAY or youll miss something important. She has quizzes every week also and she teaches the class strictly from a powerpoint. tests are hard but she puts the material online."
5611,2390034,5.0,3.0,"Popo is the sweetest person on the planet. Her class was very challenging, but doable. She offers a lot of extra credit, but her tests are way harder than they need to be. You have a quiz after every class and there is a password but its only given if you go to class. Tests can be confusing due to the language barrier and she is always right."
5612,2390034,5.0,1.0,"Reads straight from the lectures. Has password protected quizzes. if you skip, you wont get the code, but attendance isnt mandatory. Every quiz/test is online."
5613,2390034,5.0,1.0,"I love PoPo, she really cares about her students. Most of this class was online but you had to come to class or have a friend that goes to get the quiz codes. Overall not a bad class and she genuinely cares about you learning whatever material she teachers. The extra credit was a journal about yourself and it shows that she wants to know you"
5614,2390034,4.0,2.0,Poram is a great choice for medical terminology. She's a fun and caring professor who makes class easy. Class was cancelled for online tests and for some quizzes. She also gave extra credit opportunities. I got out of class early almost every time. Poram is funny and very sweet! Definitely recommend!
5615,2390034,5.0,2.0,POPO is an absolute angel. Her class is mostly online with in class lectures. It's an easy A if you just do the online portion and go to class. She gives tons of extra credit opportunities and actually cares about her students. She is super understanding as well so if you miss a quiz or class just email her and she will let you take it. 10/10
5616,2390034,5.0,2.0,I took her for Aging and Disability. She is so sweet and give a lot of extra credit out. I love her! I learned so much about the aging population and I also learned a lot about myself in this class. Also make sure you participate! The questions are not hard!
5617,2390034,4.0,2.0,She is very nice and light-hearted. She loves her students. Very accessible out of class. Big portion of class is online but enough of the class isn't online to where you have to go to class.
5618,2390034,5.0,1.0,"The only bad thing about the class is the online work, but it is an easy A if you do it!"
5619,2390034,5.0,2.0,Her class is really an online class but she still has lectures . the online portion is required. its basically your grade for the course. she gives you extra credit to do at the beginning of the semester and you have all semester to do it . shes a very caring teacher ! i would take her again. EASY A!!!
5620,2390033,1.0,5.0,"Papers summarizing the chapter for HW every week, even if she has not finished lecturing about the subject. She is always 3 chapters behind in lecture. Conflicting in her grading criteria! When emailed about assignment or grades she doesn't respond. Examples she hands out for how she wants the weekly papers to look are not at all how she grades."
5621,2390033,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Wells is such a great teacher!! i wish i couldve had her again! all of her tests are straightforward. just go to class , participate , and make sure you do your online quizzes each week and youll be fine. she is a very respectful teacher and knows how to make her class fun and engaging!"
5622,2078748,5.0,3.0,Hes a really easy going professor. The only thing I ever had a problem with was the floral i.d. quizzes. just make sure you study for those and it is an easy A.
5623,2078748,2.0,4.0,Tries to make easy classes difficult by grading ridiculously. will not take again
5624,2078748,4.0,2.0,"Super fun class, best gen ed fine art credit! 2 exams, plant ID quizzes, attendance mandatory for lab only, gives bonus point quizzes in lecture. Study for the ID quizzes (they matter a lot) and study the study guide for the exams. Lab is fun except for the $200 lab fee, but you get new flowers each week all semester so its worth it."
5625,2078748,4.5,3.0,Overall helpful and would take his wedding class.
5626,2078748,4.5,2.0,"Awesome Professor! I grew up in a flower shop and even though floral design was easy for me, it is easy for anyone if you show up for lecture and lab. 2 tests: Mid term and final. Every 2 weeks floral ID test, and then final id test at the end of semester. Do portfolios all semester and do not forget to put your name in the design pic.  "
5627,2365489,5.0,3.0,He's amazing. Easily one of the BEST teachers I have had at State. He truly cares about his students and their success. He is super passionate about his job and 10/10 would recommend him over anyone else.
5628,2709559,3.0,1.0,"This class is an intro to the major. Dr. Dean is the dean of the department so it is good to get to know him. I would highly recommend visiting his office hours once or twice during the semester and maybe getting him a gift end of the year. Class is super easy, just show up listen to the speaker for that day and write a short paragraph about it."
5629,2709559,4.0,1.0,Dr. Dean's Intro to Biochemistry class was a super easy A. You get one assignment per week where you write a 5 sentence summary on the lecture. The lectures were boring at times depending on the speakers which varied from the honor code office and the library to professors in the biochem department. He is super slow to get grades back to you though
5630,2709559,5.0,1.0,Intro to biochemistry was basically just lectures from visiting professors. All you have to do is write a paragraph about each professor's lecture and that is the only assignment each week.
5631,2709559,5.0,2.0,Dr. Deans intro to biochem class is the easiest class i have ever taken. Your grade comes from weekly writing assignments that are based off of the speakers presentation.
5632,2709559,4.0,2.0,Is not a biochemistry class. He has speakers every week and we write on the speaker. A good class to learn about people and activities on campus. Easy A if you attend and write good paragraphs and notes on what you learn! He answers emails and you most likely are able to get notes from friends!
5633,2709559,4.0,1.0,Okay so intro to bio chem isnt a bio chem class. This class is literally an orientation to your major. If youre in this class and not a bio chem major theres no point. We had random speakers. Super easy. I dont pay attention.
5634,2578502,3.0,5.0,"had him for plant genetics, super smart guy, hand wrote all the notes, never saw a book or a powerpoint and if you didn't write it down you didn't learn it. super tough class, barely passed. "
5635,2611283,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Freeman is so amazing! She really enjoys what she teaches, and it definitely fed into her lectures, which were super informative and engaging. She gives three big papers and about a dozen weekly quizzes which you definitely need to do the reading for, but for an upper level history class, it's super reasonable. I really enjoyed her class!"
5636,2611283,5.0,5.0,"Was not excited about taking this class, but Dr. Freeman was great. She is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about what she teaches, which makes class/lecture very enjoyable. She does 3 big essays and weekly quizzes that are pretty tough, but if you do the reading and pay attention in class you'll be fine. Would highly recommend her classes."
5637,2611283,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Freeman is an excellent professor. Her lectures are very interesting and discussion-based, allowing students to discuss and even debate course content. This course is writing-based, with three major papers, but Dr. Freeman provides excellent support to students seeking assistance, as well as excellent feedback when you receive a grade. "
5638,2611283,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Freeman is one of the best history professors I've had at MSU! 75% of your grade is 3 six-paged papers, and she knows if you're BS-ing the whole thing. A portion of your grade is class participation, so show up having done the reading for that day and actually talk during discussion. She really enjoys actually getting to know her students!"
5639,2611283,3.0,3.0,Weekly quizzes and instead of tests you have to write three 5-6 page papers. She gives pretty informational lectures and definitely knows what she is talking about.
5640,497752,4.5,4.0,"Extremely helpful. Funny in a math professor sort of way, but always entertaining and informative. Highly recommended."
5641,497752,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Jonkman's notes were very helpful in studying for his exams and in conducting research in my chosen field.  Attend class, take notes, and you'll do fine and even learn something!"
5642,497752,4.0,4.0,"Took regression cause I had to for my Masters.  I wish I knew how much I would need it for my research.  Dr. Jonkman did a great job, because I know what I'm doing in my project.  I wish I had appreciated his work more when I was in the course.  Thanks for your help!"
5643,2078811,4.0,3.0,Garner is a wild card of a teacher. Attempting to understand what his grading criteria is is your greatest challenge in this class. He is very vague in his criteria so you have to comb through his lectures to understand. He welcomes class participation and makes an effort to get to know his students and get them involved in lectures and discussions
5644,2078811,1.0,4.0,"Never fully explained any assignment he told us to do! He always said he never cared about the format of our papers, but then graded like he did care. I never got any constructive feedback on anything! He used words that made no sense and expected us all to just now how to do things without him explaining. Very disorganized in my opinion! No help!!"
5645,2078811,4.0,2.0,"Garner is a very chill teacher and Comp II w/ him was relatively easy. His paper grading misaligns w/ the peer critiques we do for them which is frustrating but the only hw is easy journal entries. His feedback, advice &amp; criteria can be pretty vague which is confusing sometimes too."
5646,2078811,2.0,4.0,"He's not terrible, but he definitely made the class harder than it had to be. He gives very vague feedback about your writing that makes it hard to know what he's looking for. Changes due dates and expectations for an assignment so much that it's confusing and you're never 100% sure what you're supposed to be doing. His personality is good, though."
5647,2078811,4.0,3.0,All in all he's pretty cool so far. If you enjoy lots of feedback and critical analysis of your papers definitely don't take him. If you do the work - you'll get an A. He's very sarcastic and funny. You can't take anything he says to heart.
5648,2078811,2.0,5.0,"Would not recommend if you are a good at English. Everything is broken into arbitrary sections. There are weekly journal entries that are pass/fail. Too many papers with little feedback and no constructive criticism, just broad statements about what was wrong. Makes a class that should be easy for Lib-arts majors extremely difficult for no reason"
5649,2078811,5.0,3.0,"There's a lot of writing, but he is the type of professor that looks for points to give you. If you pay attention in class and just listen you will do ok, just make sure that you read and do the homework."
5650,2078811,2.5,4.0,"I would not recommend taking Mr. Garner, especially if in high school English wasn't really taken serious. He grades extremely hard, he does not give extra credit, attendance points, or drop grades; and he overloads you with papers,meaning you are doing more than one at a time. He also does not like anything dealing with Greek life. Beware of him. "
5651,620638,3.5,3.0,"The class can be tough, but its not rediculously tough. Shes easy to follow and the material is good."
5652,620638,2.0,3.0,"She taught my class her first semester here...her tests were really difficult, but because of that she curved them. The final was comprehensive but she had a review one night that was worth sitting there for 4 hours. She basically gave us the test. So the class wasn't hard to get a good grade out of, but it was very boring."
5653,620638,2.0,5.0,"Often late to class even on test days. Buy the book, read it and understand it. She does offer extra credit but it is time consuming and difficult. Quizzes are okay..she lets you use your notes the last 5 minutes. Tests are very hard and the final is comprehensive. If you can take the class with a different instructor I would suggest doing so."
5654,161887,4.5,4.0,"I had Thomas Miller for a Cal 1 summer term, and he was fantastic. He works a little fast, but is completely open to any student speaking out and expressing their confusion. He is there for you outside of class if need be, and responds quickly to emails. His tests are very fair (he practically gives them to you on the review day). "
5655,161887,4.5,2.0,"Good, but fast.  Easily accessible out of class, will practically give away answers for Mathematica projects, which count as a combined test grade."
5656,161887,5.0,2.0,No Comments
5657,161887,3.5,2.0,No Comments
5658,161887,5.0,2.0,My best Cal teacher.  Easily available out of class for help.
5659,161887,4.0,2.0,"Moves fast, but good teacher.  Easy tests, nothing tricky."
5660,161887,4.0,2.0,This guy is a decent teacher.  He simply doesn't make your life harder than it already is.
5661,2250861,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Fraza is a really good instructor if you show him that you are interested in learning. He can seem difficult through written communication, so the best way to communicate with him is through virtual meetings. My grade improved greatly after doing this. He may come across as a difficult instructor, but if you work to communicate, he is great."
5662,2250861,5.0,3.0,Dr. Fraza is an excellent teacher. He keeps his lectures current and relevant. The course material is very well taught and he is fast to respond to email questions. I look forward to more classes with this highly knowledgeable instructor. 
5663,2250861,2.0,4.0,"Overall this professor is decent, but sometimes his lecture material and tests/quizzes can be confusing, vague and aimed more to trick the student instead of actually learning the material. His lecture notes are also poorly written, so if you take his classes, you may have to do some of your own research instead of using his notes."
5664,2250861,1.0,5.0,I did not like Dr. Fraza in the slightest. I personally think MSU's meteorology department should have somebody else teach his online classes since it seems I am not the only one who dislikes him. His class was extremely difficult.
5665,2250861,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Fraza is the worst professor I've ever had. If you need help he's barley does, that's if he answers your emails. He tries to trick you &amp; then is sarcastic &amp; rude when you ask for clarification. He also does not explain topics well. His quiz's do not make sense and often don't have the correct answers in the course lectures. Avoid him if you can"
5666,2250861,1.0,4.0,Very vague and discriminatory in grading. Will never take a class under him again
5667,2250861,5.0,3.0,Great professor and course. Would take again!
5668,2250861,1.0,4.0,"One of the worst professors I have ever had. He is a very 'gotcha' teacher, does not answer questions, and is plain rude. Do not take a class with this professor unless you absolutely have to."
5669,2250861,5.0,3.0,Dr. Fraza's Tropical Meteorology class was awesome. He is a really good professor. He also has a great sense of humor.
5670,2250861,1.0,2.0,This guy is so bad. He reads his lecture notes word for word like a 5th grade kid would. What a joke this guy is. NEVER sign up for any of his classes. Easily the worst professor I have ever had.
5671,2250861,1.0,5.0,"His courses are very difficult and you're pretty much on your own. I often needed help and he was very vague and sarcastic. I didn't ever learn much in his classes because he's just intent on the content being hard. He is very slow to respond to help requests too. If I had the choice, I wouldn't take him again, but sometimes he's the only option."
5672,2250861,1.0,4.0,"Not a very helpful teacher. Long online lectures, and very sarcastic. If you want help, you won't get it. Awkward dude with an attitude, and when you miss things on assignments he's not nice or helpful about it. If I had the option to not take him again I would, but unfortunately he leads a lot of online classes."
5673,2693238,1.0,5.0,Look up ratings for Brian Blank. Its the same guy
5674,2685050,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Askari did not work a single problem in class. He would just read off of slides that had it which were straight from the book. The homework, tests, and quizzes were completely through wiley plus. Thermo2 is basically just reading off of tables and finding states and plugging into formulas. Very boring class and he did not make it better."
5675,2685050,2.0,5.0,"Buy Moran's 8th edition (last hardcover edition printed). Thermo 2 was supposed to be a joke compared to Thermo 1... Anyway, the homework is atrocious. Not the best scenario by any means. There's really no reason for Dr. Askari to be there. He reads the power points, which are straight out of the book."
5676,2685050,1.0,4.0,"This teacher is absolutely abysmal. DO NOT TAKE HIM IF HE IS ONLINE. The classes are all just read-off-the-slide style but at mach 6, he does NOT slow down, the homework, quizzes, and tests are outsourced to Wiley Plus that he has NO control over, the homeworks took at minimum 7 hours EACH. All in all? The definition of an extremely lazy teacher."
5677,2250876,3.0,4.0,"Not the best lecturer, but a subject matter expert. Ask questions. Thats when youll understand better."
5678,2250876,1.0,3.0,"Worst grading system ever. The class has 4hr labs, and even if you have 99% of the lab done, she will give you a zero if it's not 100% complete AND correct when lab ends. Gives reading quizzes before every lecture, and covers the material on the quiz in that same lecture, so this completely blows the point of having class -after lecture is better"
5679,2250876,3.0,2.0,"When Dr. Spayde teaches, she is very monotone and it's hard to stay awake, however she will clearly answer any questions you have. The class has guest speakers coming in often. Homework is fairly difficult, so I recommend working with someone on it. Gives reading quizzes, on which you'll be fine if you read the book. Attendance is required to pass."
5680,2250876,3.0,3.0,"Lectures in this class are long and boring, however there was only a few days of that. Most classes involve a guest speaker which can be interesting. Grades are based on attendance, reading quizzes, and homework. Reading quizzes are easy as long as you read. Homework is a huge part of your grade, so make sure you do it correctly."
5681,2250876,5.0,5.0,"Mrs. Spayde did a great job teaching this class. She writes notes and examples on the board and you follow along. She is very good at explaining topics and has an open door policy if you need to go see her. Tests in this class are difficult, especially the 1st test. She will not spoon feed you, but she is a good teacher and a fair grader."
5682,2250876,1.0,3.0,"""Teaches"" off of the slides. Expects you to fully understand how SolidWorks is used and how to use it by the end of the semester when all she does is tell you to do the tutorials given from the software and doesn't really teach you anything else."
5683,2185344,1.0,5.0,Questions were never answered well. The class was taught as if we already knew the material and just needed a brief overview. Had to teach myself everything outside of class. It is possible to do well but you will need outside help. I would recommend taking anyone else in the chem department. test avg was always in low 50s or high 40s. So stressful
5684,2185344,3.0,5.0,Dr. Hollis is certainly not my favorite professor but I'm sure there is worse. I was blown off when asking for help a number of times as there seems to be some favoritism towards some students. I studied a lot and basically taught myself but did pretty well. I wouldn't take him if you aren't willing to do most of the learning on your own.
5685,2185344,2.0,5.0,"Obviously cares about his students but he teaches on a grad level or like we've already had this class before.  Also, the final is half the grade, but it's still discouraging to have the whole class fail a test and he doesn't seem to think anything of it.  The concepts are extremely hard to grasp and require extreme amounts of studying.  Good luck"
5686,2185344,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Hollis teaches as if you already have an understanding of the subject & you're taking a refresher course. He kinda speeds through material so reading the chapter before class really isn't a bad idea. But his grading scale is amazing; a 50 is a C and a 70 is a B. He's very understanding that it's a hard course, but you have to work for the grade"
5687,2324610,5.0,5.0,"A lot of these reviews accuse Dr. Shelton of being tough. That wasn't my experience. There was a lot of reading involved, and the midterm and final are in essay format, but if you review your lecture notes actively and consult him with any questions you have, you should have no trouble excelling in this class."
5688,2324610,2.0,4.0,He made an easy A class very hard for no reason. I worked hard all semester and barely made a C.
5689,2324610,4.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Shelton for Cultural Geo. Most students say that he is a horrible teacher because his tests are hard. I don't think this is fair since he provides a thorough study guide, explains the test format, &amp; is always free for further explanation outside of class. He gives stimulating lectures &amp; really encourages everyone. Plus extra credit too!"
5690,2324610,1.0,4.0,Not the worst but also not the best. He was very unclear about what he wanted out of assignments. Soooooo much reading and everything was very dense and abstract. Would not recommend taking the class or the professor.
5691,2324610,1.0,4.0,"Overall a poor professor, very awkward and rarely clear about what he actually wanted from us. Assigned an unreasonable amount of reading (even for grad students) and when asked to clarify what he wanted from us he didn't seem to know (but graded like he did). Overall the class and curriculum proved extremely useless and unnecessarily hard."
5692,2324610,2.0,5.0,Shelton is a nice guy and his lectures are interesting. Exams are extremely difficult - all fill in the blank (no word banks) so start memorizing slides and vocab on Day 1. There are two projects that are hard as well. When I asked for clarification he just shrugged his shoulders and then gave me a 70. Took for int'l elective and hoping to pass.
5693,2324610,5.0,3.0,"Fairly new to teaching and a bit awkward, but he has gotten much more confident. Gave two writing assignments and three tests. Tests are straight-forward, no trick questions. Writing assignments are fair, but require thought. Attendance is mandatory or he will take off points. Plenty of easy extra credit opportunities. Notes are released every week"
5694,1849483,1.0,5.0,"He is the worst teacher I've ever had! Take anyone else for organic! Since he alternates teaching organic 1 and organic 2 every other semester, I would highly recommend waiting an entire semester just to avoid taking him. He's horrible!"
5695,1849483,4.0,3.0,"I don't see why everyone hates on Dr. Rabideau. He's a bit dry, and could use a public speaking class, but he's very good at chemistry. He does scale everything to an average of 65, but you do have to try hard to do well. If you focus on learning the material, the grade will follow. I'm taking him again for Organic II if that tells you anything."
5696,1849483,1.0,5.0,This is the absolute WORST TEACHER I have EVER had. Terrible instructor. Rude to anyone who dares to ask a question. Skims over material in class. Often test material is not even mentioned in class. Often unprepared for lab because of material he did not cover. DO NOT understand how he keeps his job. DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!
5697,1849483,1.0,5.0,He's the worst teacher I've ever had at Mississippi State! Avoid taking him at all cost!
5698,1849483,1.0,5.0,"If at all possible, take any other teacher. He's really sarcastic to people that ask questions and barely goes over the material. His tests are multiple choice, but in the end, that doesn't help. I know organic is a hard class, but he makes it harder."
5699,1849483,3.5,4.0,"Organic is a difficult course to begin with, but Rabideau makes it a little better. He is extremely helpful in class, and constantly encourages people to ask questions. He also goes over review questions from each chapter the class before the test. All tests are multiple choice."
5700,1849483,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE PETER RABIDEAU!! He is a horrible teacher with ridiculously hard tests. He's rude to people that ask questions and is extremely unhelpful.
5701,1669261,5.0,1.0,I am in her class right no. She is a fantastic teacher. Goes into great detail and explains everything real well. She is even helping me get over my fear of public speaking.
5702,1669261,3.5,2.0,"Great teacher! She explained concepts very well, and made class a comfortable enviroment. You will have to speak in front of the class, but throughout the semester you'll become very close with your class. This class should be required for all majors! Loved it!"
5703,1726606,4.5,1.0,"Had him for Introduction to Biochemistry. Literally all you have to do is show up and sign the attendance sheet to get a good grade. I didn't have any hw/tests/quizzes. He was very nice and entertaining. We had a bunch of cool guest speakers, so I learned a lot while in this class."
5704,1849488,4.0,2.0,"Thinks super fast which will can him to stutter. Reminds me of a Jeff Goldbloom personality. Read the material and you'll get an A, seriously. You'll go over the material after its been assigned and he'll interpret it for you. If you take notes you cant NOT make an A. Personally enjoyed his clas."
5705,1849488,1.0,4.0,STAY AWAY! Professor Davis is almost impossible to follow in class due to his erratic speech and constantly losing his train of thought. The profanity is funny for a little while but gets old. His test are short answer and essay based and he does a terrible job of explaining the material. If it wasnt for YouTube I wouldnt be passing (gpa is 3.54)
5706,1849488,2.0,3.0,"I decided to take business ethics because I really loved my intro to philosophy class. Huge mistake. Not only is business ethics incredibly boring, Professor Davis made it even more so. He spends the entire class reading off power points. The weekly reading quizzes can be difficult; even if you do the reading. The exams are short answer/essay heavy"
5707,1849488,2.0,1.0,"Professor Davis drove me insane. You may as well throw away your schedule because he doesn't stick to it, and he constantly moves exams. By midterm I had 1 exam and 8 quizzes that I hadn't seen a grade for. Getting your grade is like pulling teeth. Only redeeming quality is that there are a TON of bonus point opportunities."
5708,1849488,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Davis was a fine teacher. I took him for Intro to Philosophy and got an A in the class. Test's are pretty straight forward - just memorize the class outlines. Philosophy is not the most interesting class (for me) so that is why the lectures seem longer and boring, nothing to do with Mr. Davis. I would take him again."
5709,1849488,4.0,3.0,He is willing to explain if you don't understand. He gives numerous extra credit and grade replacing opportunities. He says the book is mandantory but I never used it.
5710,1849488,3.0,4.0,You really need to take a few philosophy classes before this one. His examples lack clarity. Hard to follow sometimes. Test are very challenging and with lots of essay questions.
5711,1849488,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE JORDAN DAVIS! He gives a difficult quiz once a week on 20 to 30 pages of material not covered in class. We had a quiz once a week, boring and confusing lectures for the full class time, two 6 page papers, and 2 non-multiple choice tests (a midterm and final). He grades harshly, especially if your opinion differs from his."
5712,2029721,3.0,4.0,"She's an ""ok""teacher. She gives quizzes on material she doesn't go over in class, but they are online so you can take them multiple times. She never sticks to her schedule.  Avoid this woman! She can also be very rude at times and seems to forget that students have other responsibilities than just her class.  "
5713,1669274,3.0,2.0,I had trouble staying focused in this class. He is older and is not familiar with technology which is his down fall. He just reads the power points during lecture which make no sense. It is mostly words jotted down. Take GOOD notes and write down everything he says. He tells you to read the book but I do not see where this helps any.
5714,1669274,3.0,2.0,"He was an ok teacher. My class was at 8 o'clock, and we were all tired. Didn't seem that interested in the material, and just basically read powerpoints. The tests weren't that bad as long as you studied. He always gave a gimme question too."
5715,2463897,5.0,2.0,"Easy A. It got moved online and there were no lectures. Just had to find and answer the questions from the books, and watch videos and list 15 facts you learned from the video. Couldn't find the book online, rented it from the bookstore used. Only two tests, a midterm and a final, both easy."
5716,2463897,2.0,1.0,"She's quite lazy when it comes to replying to emails or opening assignments. She says she opens them a week in advance, but it's usually two days before the due date. Cancels class a lot. She's very sweet though and is willing to work with you."
5717,2439324,5.0,1.0,"He does drone on when he lectures, but Mr. Singleton is one of the best profs at State. I had his intro to SO class, and he was very understanding of it. He wanted his students to pass so he made as many opportunities for students to take for extra credit. Loved his class, would recommend to anyone looking for an easy A."
5718,2439324,4.0,2.0,"Always ready to help, but his lectures are boring. If you show you care about your performance and grades, he will help as much as possible."
5719,2439324,5.0,1.0,"Professor Singleton understands that this is a freshman course. If you are a freshman, he really tries to make your introduction to college as smooth as possible. Make sure you show up to class, do all your assignments, and take your online quizzes on time. It will all pay off in the end. The content of the course is also very interesting."
5720,2439324,5.0,2.0,The best professor Ive had. Mr. Singleton tells the straight up truth about inequality in American. He exposes the lies used by the right wing to maintain racial inequality and to keep a hold on power by fooling people into hate. He taught us about the systemic racism of voter suppression and mass incarceration  as true as it get here at MSU!!!!!
5721,2439324,5.0,1.0,"Hands down the best professor I've had. He cares so much about his students. He holds study sessions before every test, and he gives extra credit opportunities after every test for those that need it. Study guides are just like the exam."
5722,2439324,5.0,1.0,"An amazing professor who connects his lectures what's happening in the world and is willing to hear students' opinions. He offers study session multiple times a week, provides a study guide for each chapter, and releases review slides that basically explain all that you need to know for the tests. The only class I looked forward to this semester."
5723,2439324,3.0,4.0,"Amazing/super cool guy and very interesting lectures. Class lectures tend to connect the sociological terminology to the real world so if you don't teach yourself the basics then you will probably tank the course. The textbook is an online purchase and all weekly quizzes are online, 10 questions each. Do the work and you'll get an A or B."
5724,2439324,5.0,1.0,"If you need a Sociology class, take Mr. Singleton!! He's the nicest teacher I've ever had and is really helpful. If you're struggling in the class and you show that you're making an effort, he will do everything in his power to help you! He offers study sessions every week too. Online code is mandatory just for the online quizzes which are easy."
5725,2439324,3.0,1.0,"Mr. Singleton is a good professor with a very easy class. I took him for Intro to Sociology, and he gave us every opportunity to have a good grade. He gave so many extra credit opportunities that you almost didnt even have to take the tests. He provided over 3 study sessions a week, and reviewed exactly what we needed to know for the test in class"
5726,2439328,5.0,3.0,"Very nice lady. Didnt require attendance, and all assignments and tests were online. She made it known on our first day that she was aware her class would be at the bottom of our priorities so it was all very easy work."
5727,2439328,5.0,1.0,"Lectures were very long, but pretty interesting because they were about music. She is very passionate about the topics she discusses, which makes it easier to learn. The tests were very easy and open book. 100% recommend this class. "
5728,2439328,5.0,2.0,"The textbook is very important to doing homework. The lectures were a little boring, but they were straightforward, and she was very knowledgeable on the subject. There were a couple extra credit opportunities, but the tests were online so you probably didn't need them."
5729,2439328,5.0,1.0,Take her! Dr. Haislip clearly cares abundantly about learning and not so much about grading/frivolous assignments. I legitimately walked away from this course &quot;appreciating&quot; music in a way I did not expect. Assignments and tests are very easy.
5730,2439328,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Haislip Is great. While her lectures can be mundane, she definitely cares about her class and is happy to work with you. This is the easiest A I've ever gotten from State. Homework is mostly discussions and listening assignments. Hardly any writing, just online participation. 3 online exams with no final, super sweet lady and a great class."
5731,2439328,5.0,1.0,Dr Haislip is the best teacher at MSU. Took this class as an elective and its the easiest class Ive ever taken. Didnt attend a single class after the first month of school and still passed with a 97. She gives extra credit and grades easy and fair. The class isnt assignment heavy so makes for an easy A
5732,2439328,5.0,1.0,"Very easy. Sometimes there was a lot of homework, but not always. Tests are taken open-book. Attendance is not required, but I would suggest going on days that you expect many people to skip because she offers bonus points typically."
5733,2439328,5.0,2.0,"The sweetest lady ever but most boring class possible. All tests are online. There are two concert reports due in the semester and chapter summaries due every other week, those are the most work you do. Look at the syllabus and see when in-class listening activities are. Attendance not mandatory except for the listening activities."
5734,2439328,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Cary is probably the easiest professor you could have for a fine arts credit. Attendance is not mandatory, and her tests are online. You do have to attend two art music concerts and write reports about them, but she is an easy grader."
5735,399524,2.0,4.0,"Easily one of the most boring professors I have ever taken. I had to take this class as a non-psychology major and it was a terrible decision. Psychology majors seemed even reluctant to take it. He gives you the majority of terms and everything you need in class, I would say textbook is optional; he wrote it."
5736,399524,4.5,2.0,"I personally enjoyed Dr. Klein's class.  At first I thought it was really boring, but the class itself I found very interesting so I really enjoyed it.  Dr.   Klein is very nice and helpful!  He also gives a lot of extra credit through quizzes and homework assignments.  I made really good grades on his tests as well."
5737,399524,2.5,2.0,"be sure to caff up before attending this class. i'm pretty sure i caught my neighbor snoring once or twice! the man is boring, but clearly cares about the subject matter and is well educated. i learned a lot, but i had to try hard to stay awake!"
5738,399524,2.5,3.0,"Incredibly boring, reads verbatim from his notes, shows lots of film clips though. Tests are easy if you attend the study sessions and take the practice tests available on WebCT"
5739,399524,1.0,5.0,he's soooo boring! get ready to take a nap. makes psychology very boring.
5740,399524,2.5,3.0,"reads straight from his notes... that he hands out in class... the tests are pretty straight forward, but the man is boring"
5741,399524,3.0,4.0,No Comments
5742,399524,1.0,3.0,HE IS SOOO BORING!!
5743,399524,1.0,1.0,No Comments
5744,399524,2.0,2.0,"Terrible lectures that had me sleeping more than once despite my interest in the subject.  Earned an A test averages, but I ended up with a B because my first paper made poor use of characters (its a science class not English comp!)."
5745,399524,5.0,3.0,No Comments
5746,2554035,1.0,1.0,Professor Ayers was my Academic advisor and would not let me turn a paper one day late to get the .67 of a point to pass his class. I explained to him that I had a lot of other assignments due that week and he did not seem to care at all. Professor ayers doesn't care at all about his students or their success.
5747,2554035,4.0,3.0,"I took his WFA professions class and it felt like a waste of time. If attendance isnt mandatory for you (extracurriculsrs, freshmen, etc) then dont bother showing up."
5748,2554035,5.0,4.0,"He doesnt do many lectures himself, you have a lot of guest lectures in Wildlife Fisheries Profession class"
5749,2554035,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Ayers genuinely cares about his students and their success. He pushes you to learn and think critically, but he is always willing to help and further break things down. He is extremely passionate about the subjects he teaches. There was a lot of reading in this class, but I found the readings pretty interesting so it wasn't that bad."
5750,2554035,4.0,2.0,"If math is your worst subject, Professor Ayers makes it less difficult. During the pandemic, this class was all online, (no zoom meetings) and just email for communication. The textbook is an online workbook with all the hw and tests on it and he was kind enough to give 5 attempts with formulas on each assignment."
5751,2554035,5.0,2.0,Dr. Ayers seems to genuinely care about all of his students and makes an effort to find interesting guest speakers. Really chill guy and an easy class if you do your reading.
5752,759987,3.0,4.0,"Pretty boring lecturer, but if you're able to pay attention he'll prepare you for the test. He does seem pretty enthusiastic about physics. But he's a naturally un-enthusiastic personality."
5753,759987,1.0,5.0,Clay was one of the worst teachers I've ever taken. He works problems in class and skips parts of them. He explains nothing and brings up equations without telling you about them or not including them on the formula sheet. He is a skittish teacher and is not confident in his answers and never answers your questions. Pray that you don't have him.
5754,759987,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Clay is both a brilliant professor and physicist. Thermal Physics is complicated and challenging, but he made it interesting and accessible. He REALLY cares about his students and will go above and beyond to help you learn. Very willing to answer questions and help with homework. Hard tests. Curves final grade. Take him for anything you can."
5755,759987,1.5,5.0,boring class...very hard to pay attention to his lectures...i hated every minute of it...wound up with a B in the class
5756,759987,1.5,5.0,everyday he has a slide show of notes.. never works problmes but expects you to be able to on tests...his tests are multiple choice so that may be good for some of you..horrible avoid him if possible...
5757,2447541,5.0,1.0,"An amazing teacher (best one Ive had at MSU). The only teacher Ive had who cares about me, she emails me outside of class to ask how I am. Very understanding as well and will help with just about anything. Cares for her students wellbeing in and out of classes."
5758,2447541,5.0,1.0,"I absolute love Ms. Stamps! She honestly cares about all of her students potential to succeed at MSU! Her passion for what she does shines through her compassionate personality! Ms. Stamps makes you feel welcomed and she allows you to know your worth! She will do whatever she can to help you. She is more than a professor, Ms. Stamps is a friend!!!!"
5759,2816184,1.0,5.0,She takes this class way too seriously and grades like I am getting my masters degree in religion when everyone only takes this class for an elective. Readings are SO long up to like 70 pages each multiple times a week and u cant even understand them. About to be the only reason I dont have a 4.0 and my major is accounting. 
5760,2816184,1.0,5.0,"Horrible. Never take her, she takes everything too seriously. Has to read 2 readings a week, 50 pages or more each. Grades like a masters class, not an elective. Ridiculous, DO NOT TAKE."
5761,2816184,1.0,3.0,Takes this class way too seriously.
5762,1472704,4.0,2.0,"She teaches at Towson now. Her tests a little hard, but you never need to read the book because her powerpoints are very detailed. Just take lots of notes. She is really sweet and funny. Group project isn't bad."
5763,1472704,3.0,4.0,cool
5764,2693322,4.0,5.0,Must read the assigned text. The programs are hard and will take you multiple days but are satisfying to complete. Dr. Luke is helpful when accomplishing assigned work and usually responds to questions quickly. The tests are hard and you must practice the application of the knowledge. The tests are not regurgitation of facts. 
5765,2693322,4.0,4.0,"Great professor, but be prepared to put a good amount of work in. Grades favorably."
5766,1677516,4.0,2.0,"He is an okay teacher. He likes to hold discussions featuring the readings he gives you, but he lets you know about them beforehand. He teaches mainly off of slides, but he also teaches via his lectures. His tests are mostly based on his study guides, but there are always questions about the lectures, so it's a good idea to go to class."
5767,932078,5.0,3.0,Dr. Bisson is one of those people that knows the information AND can teach. He's a rare gem! He cares a lot about his student's well-being and is flexible if you miss an assignment for any reason. I wish I could take all of his classes. 
5768,932078,5.0,1.0,"He makes the material very easy to grasp and understand. There are weekly reading assignments, so you do need the book, but they are very manageable. Really sweet and cares about students. Tests were short essay but very easy."
5769,932078,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I've had. He makes the class very interesting and enjoyable. Incredibly easy-going and understanding as well. The only major assignment is an 8-10 page paper and the tests are very straight forward. Very fair grading.
5770,932078,5.0,3.0,Everybody loves Dr Bison! Whoever gave him 4 stars was obviously having a bad day! Great experience would recommend.
5771,932078,4.0,1.0,"I personally loved this class. It was online, but I learned so much and found the material to be really interesting. We had 2 writing assignments each week that were thought-provoking and pretty easy. I would definitely take this professor again!"
5772,932078,5.0,2.0,Dr. Bisson is incredible! He is very flexible when it comes to quizzes and tests. He is so knowledgable and interesting. He will always stay to answer questions and if he doesn't know the answer he will research and get back to you the next class. I am minoring in religion because his classes are so enjoyable!
5773,932078,5.0,2.0,"Professor Bisson is a great teacher. If you ever get the chance to take his course, do yourself a favor and sign up!"
5774,932078,1.0,4.0,Mr. Bisson was not accesssible at anytime during this course. I reached out for extra help with material that was difficult to understand and couldnt even get an email reply. Online professors should understand that students are paying more in tuition and should at least have access to an instructor if needed. Mr. Bisson also doesnt use blackboard.
5775,932078,5.0,3.0,Probably the best teacher I ever had. I learned tons from him and he was always available to talk to.
5776,932078,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Bisson is by far my favorite professor. His lectures are so interesting that it really makes it easy to retain the information. Show up, take notes, and actually study the material t retain and you'll do fine. He's very lenient and understanding and will help you out in any way possible."
5777,932078,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor! I love his classes so much, I might get a religion minor just to keep taking them. You will learn SO much, and not have to stress out about difficult tests. Pay attention, take notes, and you should have no trouble getting an A."
5778,932078,5.0,2.0,"Amazing teacher. You will understand everything, and his test are not hard to begin with. They do not have to be hard. His teaching is effective enough."
5779,932078,5.0,1.0,excellent teacher
5780,932078,5.0,1.0,"Intro to religion - Dr. Bisson was an interesting lecturer, especially because of his British accent. His class is not difficult if you take good notes and are good at memorization. I had to write a research paper for him, but it wasn't a huge deal. Take him!"
5781,2128116,5.0,4.0,Dr. Barefield is one of my favorite teachers. I had him freshman year and he went out of his way to help me with anything that I had questions on... school related or not. He always keeps you involved in his lectures. Just an all around great guy. I would highly recommend you take his classes any chance you get!
5782,2128116,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Barefield is a great teacher, and he cares about his students. I was in the honors section, so it was a smaller sized class which I think was beneficial. The material is not easy, but he holds weekly review sessions that are very helpful. Going to lecture is important - no powerpoints or book, also gives pop quizzes."
5783,2128116,5.0,3.0,"I LOVED Dr. Barefield! I have never had a professor that cared about his students more than him. I went to his office once for help and he basically retaught me an entire lesson, complete with practice problems and everything. He is so patient with people that are willing to put in work. You may have to read a few chapters or two, but it isn't bad."
5784,2128116,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Barefield is a great lecturer. No notes are provided via PowerPoint or otherwise and must come from your own notes taken off of his talks. If you are struggling or confused at all, he is very easy to meet with and will help until you are comfortable with the material. He also holds weekly review sessions which prove beneficial. Would take again"
5785,2128116,2.0,5.0,"Attendance isnt mandatory, but theres a pop quiz about half the time, so you have to show up. The tests are vague on open ended questions. Grades are based on the most common answer. He will tell you the answer to a question then count off because you didnt word that exact answer specifically enough. He is willing to meet to discuss, though."
5786,2128116,4.0,4.0,Dr. Barefield is very good at lecturing and is willing to work with students who are struggling. You have to be willing to learn from story type examples and also be willing to put in the work because it is not an easy A for sure. I would recommend him for this course.
5787,2128116,4.0,5.0,"I was in the honors section, and all the tests were completely open-ended, so he could take off points without comment. Although the material could be complicated, he was VERY accessible outside the classroom and would work with you until you understood the material. Fantastic teacher, tough grader."
5788,2128116,3.0,2.0,You need to go to class. He will give a pop quiz if there is enough students missing from his class or even if nobody is missing. His test are very hard if you do not study (even if you pay attention in class). He asks the questions very vaguely. He made the class interesting and interacted with the students. Great professor for economics.
5789,2128116,4.0,4.0,Great Professor! Highly recommend! Taken for AgEcon and was an enjoyable class. Holds review session weekly to help reinforce topics of the week.
5790,2128116,1.0,5.0,This professor is absolutely ridiculous and all I have to say is good luck. By far the hardest and most confusing professor Ive ever had.
5791,2128116,5.0,3.0,Awesome guy and teacher would highly recomend to get to know him and go to his office he is very helpful and wants you to do good
5792,2128116,1.0,5.0,"The worst prof I've ever had. If you're confused about a topic, be sure to approach him in office hours and not during class unless you don't mind being talked down to in front of everyone. Test difficulty  ridiculous."
5793,2128116,2.0,4.0,Lectures usually go over the class time. Makes a lot of mistakes and is overall confusing. Talks down to students when they don't understand concepts.
5794,2136321,3.0,3.0,"Mediocre. Not the worst not the best. Not clear grader, can be picky or can be generous with no rhyme or reason."
5795,2136321,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Calvert is an excellent math teacher, with the only difficult part of the class being how boring it is. If you can stay awake, take notes, and study for the tests, you'll do fine. She grades relatively tough but very fair. Test reviews are really good and accurate to test content. Don't miss those review days."
5796,2136321,5.0,2.0,"The lectures were amazing. They were not always the most interesting, but she conveyed the material perfectly. She is one of the few instructors that I felt knew exactly what she was teaching and how to teach it. Her tests were very fair and if you put in some effort, you can easily get an A. If you ever have linear algebra, get this person."
5797,2136321,3.0,4.0,Print. Her. Notes.!!! Must prepare well for tests. MyMath Lab HW and Quizzes are easy grades and NEEDED to help average. Sweet and teachers okay. Just a tough class.
5798,2136321,4.0,3.0,"Shes not bad, really good at teaching how to work problems, but not as good at conceptual things. Quiet speaker. Only reason I wouldnt take her again is I think there is one professor who is slightly better."
5799,2136321,5.0,4.0,"Straightforward and by the book, uses mathlab and honorlock. No surprises - tests are like quizzes which are like homeworks. Doesn't cater to whiners or give extra credit. Well prepared - didn't have technical difficulties teaching online. Advice to learn to use your calculator quickly for the 2nd test and later (rec hp prime or ti89/92)"
5800,2136321,1.0,5.0,Tough lectures. Youll learn more doing the homework.
5801,2136321,2.0,3.0,"As a 4.0 student, I had to retake this class. Linear Algebra should be an easy class, but Calvert is very quiet, hard to understand, and speaks fast. She is sweet but confusing. She is SO passionate about math, but assumes students &quot;don't care&quot;, which shows in her teaching &amp; is discouraging. I retook this class w/ another professor and got an A."
5802,2136321,3.0,4.0,Basic mathematics professor. Saying she is fast is a bit of an understatement.
5803,2136321,3.0,4.0,"Calvert is not the worst, I'd say the biggest improvement to be made is her ability to engage the class. I know many people who also took her and all had the same opinion, it's hard to stay focused most days. Tests aren't terrible, but they are significantly more advanced than homework, and they try to trip you up."
5804,2136321,3.0,3.0,Calvert's lectures are very boring (like most people knocked out boring) and she is a specific grader. Her tests are difficult but her final does replace your lowest test grade which significantly helps.
5805,2136321,3.0,4.0,"She's a very nice lady, but her lectures are extremely boring. Tries to be clear, but she talks so fast that she is hard to understand. Gives lots of homework, but her organized notes help when working it. Tests are fairly straightforward, but she isn't the most lenient grader and will mark off more than needed for small mistakes"
5806,2136321,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Calvert knows her stuff and conveys it as effectively as she can. However she is somewhat quiet and her asides sometimes come off very awkward. It would be very difficult to make Linear Algebra a fun class so I don't blame her for the boring material. If you're confused, ask questions. She will answer and his available in her office."
5807,2136321,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Calvert is an excellent choice for linear algebra. She makes the subject easy enough to understand so that you are mostly prepared for the homework, which would also prepare you for the test. The homework is extremely time consuming, which can be a problem for a student taking more than 15 hours, but it does help to understand concepts."
5808,2136321,4.0,3.0,"I have her for Linear Algebra. She's a great professor, but her lectures are extremely boring. Most of the homework problems are not what is gone over in class (you have to put 2 and 2 together to figure it out). She does plenty of examples and goes over extra stuff to help you figure stuff out. She prepares you well for tests also."
5809,2136321,4.0,3.0,"Nicest teacher ever. She is very caring and wants everyone to do well. Lectures are boring, but linear algebra isn't exactly thrilling to begin with. Prepares you well for tests. Tests are fair especially for the time limit given. She does grade very specifically."
5810,2136321,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Calvert is a solid choice for actually learning linear algebra without having to stress to earn an A. She tries a little too hard to be cute sometimes, but she also provides more than enough examples to understand the material and homework is a free 100 for 15% of your grade. Her tests are also very fair, and good attendance gives extra credit"
5811,2136321,5.0,2.0,"She is the best Linear Algebra teacher I could imagine. She does plenty of examples, never goes over time, and explains in a slow and easy to understand manner. If you can, take her for any possible math class. Also on 2 out of 3 tests there was a chance for 5 points of extra credit."
5812,2136321,5.0,3.0,"Velinda Calvert is probably the best Differential Equations teacher as Mississippi State.  Her lectures can be a little slow, but her tests are fair and she conveys the material well.  You'll have to work a bit for your test grades, but her formula sheet system is really fair and helps. Mathematica projects aren't fun, but there aren't many of them"
5813,1046793,1.0,5.0,"Horrible Professor. Horrible Person. Gives impossible homework assignments. Gives impossible exams. Not friendly. Class not interesting at all. Has his favorites. The ones who are struggling he will not help. Went to him for assistance. He acted as if I were bothering him. Well, Dr. Morse, I'm a Ph.D. now. I hated this class."
5814,1046793,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Morse is the best instructor I have ever had in my college career (undergrad and grad). The way he designs his homework promotes understanding. I worked hard in this class, but that is what I expect from any course. If you plan to write a dissertation, HIS EPY 9213+8214 are most helpful."
5815,1046793,4.0,4.0,I took stats and research classes from Dr. Morse about 20 years ago...college is not supposed to easy!! He was great!!
5816,1046793,1.0,5.0,Worst class I have ever taken!
5817,1046793,4.5,4.0,"I took had this professor for both Educational Statistics 2 and 3. (I can't recall the course numbers).  Yes he was hard, but I knew the informaton well after completing the course. I earned a B in the second ed. stats and an A in the third ed stats. I would have had it no other way. I feel that Dr. Morse has well prepared me for educational stats."
5818,1046793,1.0,5.0,Hated this class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5819,1046793,4.5,5.0,"This class was tough, and anyone who is going to take it should be prepared up front to do lots of out-of-class work.  Dr. Morse is easy to contact by email except on weekends.  He is always ready to answer questions.  I would take him again in a heartbeat!"
5820,1046793,4.5,5.0,Hardest class of my life.  Morse is fantastic though.  You HAVE to ask questions!
5821,1046793,3.0,4.0,"He teaches a hard subject but as far as statisticians go, he explained things the best I have experienced.  I thought it was a challenging class, but I liked it."
5822,1046793,1.0,5.0,"He is, without a doubt, the single worst professor that I have ever had the experience of taking.  There is no level of &quot;helpfulness.&quot;  He doesn't want to interact with anyone.  He gives impossible amounts of work...and doesn't explain AT ALL how to do any homework whatsoever.  Am I bitter--yes!  I found taking this class extraordinarly harrowing!!"
5823,1571086,3.0,2.0,"Canceled all Monday classes. Have to do 20 hours volunteering at an equine therapy clinic, not hard just inconvenient. Tests are 100 questions lock down browser and take so long. Not hard. interesting class. "
5824,1571086,2.0,3.0,"If you don't have any prior knowledge of horses, beware of this class because not much beyond reading words off of a slide is done. Her tests are ridiculously long for the time provided (100 questions in 90 minutes, 200 for the final) and a lot of people struggled to even finish the test. However, the quizzes during each week are manageable."
5825,1571086,5.0,1.0,Class was super easy. A lot of busy work
5826,1571086,5.0,1.0,Dr. Nicodemus is a great professor and this was an extremely easy class. There is a decent amount of weekly discussion posts and assignments as well as a group project. The final is also a project. You don't meet every week for class but most meetings you'll have to turn something in for attendance so definitely don't skip.
5827,1571086,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely love Dr. Nicodemus! This is the third class I've had with her and she has been equally great. Gives lots of assignments so it's easy to make an A, nothing too hard. There's 2 projects but as long as you start it early enough to finish on time it's nothing extreme. Great professor and her classes are great."
5828,1571086,4.0,1.0,"Gives a lot of in class work, when she doesn't cancel class. One major group project and one individual project. Lots to guest speakers. Lot of out of class work (workbook)"
5829,1571086,5.0,3.0,She is a really nice person and I love her classes! Her tests cover about 6 huge packets of totally different topics. The packets are fill in the blank but thats not even whats on her tests! Be sure to study THE WHOLE ENTIRE PACKETS and know several examples that are listed in them. This was my 2nd time taking her and I will take her again!
5830,1571086,4.0,2.0,"Daily attendance points by use of worksheets, group discussion, or quiz but quizzes are all open note and super easy. One group project and one paper to write but not terrible. Paper is long so don't wait to write it. Tests hold a lot of information on them but if you study the notes they aren't bad. Super accessible outside of class!"
5831,1571086,5.0,2.0,"I love Dr. Nicodemus! She teaches a lot of the equine classes at State, and for that Im grateful. She is caring. Offers a lot of extra credit opportunitys! Her test can be tough/tricky but if you study her handouts about a week in advance and truly study, youll ace the tests! I will definitely be taking her again for other classes!"
5832,1571086,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Nicodemus is one of the best professors at State! Equine Assisted Therapy was the third class Ive taken with her, and it will most likely not be the last. Class was interesting, lab was amazing and inspirational, but tests were a little hard. Extra hours in lab means extra credit in class, and she doesnt mind if you dont come just email her."
5833,1571086,4.0,3.0,Dr. Nicodemus teaches a majority of the equine classes. She gets very excited when she is teaching and loves to answer questions. She is easy to talk to and is very helpful. There is enough extra credit to pass even if you fail all the exams. Make sure you follow her notes and study and you will be perfectly fine!
5834,1571086,1.0,2.0,Her lectures cover very arbitrary material and exams are loaded with specific questions regarding useless information. I would not waste your time with companion animal if you want to sift through 8 packets of material per test. She has a tendency to make claims based on information with no scientific proof. She is very difficult to listen to.
5835,1571086,3.0,2.0,"Her class is incredibly easy so long as you actually show up to class, do the lab hours, and turn in your assignments. The tests are true to what she says they will be and she is more than willing to help her students with anything they struggle with. Overall a good professor if you're taking one of her classes."
5836,1571086,5.0,1.0,"She is a wonderful teacher willing to help in anyway. She gave us a syllabus at the beginning of the year with everything we would do. She takes late work, and is willing to help in any way possible."
5837,1571086,3.0,2.0,"Career Planning is an easy class. For other classes, I could see how Nicodemus could be frustrating. She constantly changed assignment requirements, and gave homework that felt excessive for a 1 hour credit class. The 3 main projects are a group presentation, writing a resume & cover letter, and doing a ""mock interview."""
5838,1571086,5.0,1.0,"Very helpful, goes out of her way to help students. Wont fail a student unless they just plum won't try"
5839,2128148,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Armstrong is a wonderful professor. You need to read the textbook as well as come to class because material from both formats will be on the test. The final exam can replace your lowest test grade, which makes it fairly easy to get a good grade in her class. She is very caring and makes this class relatable to your life outside of college. "
5840,2128148,5.0,3.0,"Professor Armstrong is very straight to the point and she uses a lot of application questions on her exams. She is very thorough but you still have to read the textbook to get all of the information for the tests. The best lecturer I've had in college so far and she is always open to questions, especially during class time."
5841,2128148,2.0,3.0,"Mrs. Armstrong is a nice person, but not a great professor. Attendance isn't mandatory but she gives terms not in the book, but only going to class won't get you an A. She takes forever to grade exams, tells too many stories, changes what she focuses on in exams, and even her syllabus has no information on it. I still like her as a person though."
5842,2128148,4.0,2.0,Her lectures are really easy to listen to and to understand. She lets you know exactly what is going to be on the exams.
5843,1620244,3.0,4.0,Would not take her again as you can't go by your first draft papers grading because she will not count off on it but then get you for it on the final.  She's a nice enough person but requires page limits and wants a lot of filler.  Half the class at midterms had Ds
5844,1620244,2.0,4.0,"If you rely on peer edits and graded rough drafts to help you with your final draft of papers don't take her class. She doesn't believe in peer edits or rough drafts so you really have to guess when writing the final paper. clear rubrics, just very nit picky on many details (will take points off for little things such as comma splices)."
5845,1620244,5.0,1.0,Awesome English Comp 1 teacher.  She is incredibly nice and helpful in class.  She does each essay step by step so it's nearly impossible to not do great.  I received good grades.  I even signed up for her comp II class!
5846,1620244,4.5,1.0,"Very easy, will help with anything if you ask. Good timing for papers, and very high-school class. Easy grading too!"
5847,1620244,4.0,2.0,"Attendance isn't mandatory to pass, but she takes roll everyday. She's very high-school, not extremely challenging. Nice and willing to help!"
5848,1620250,5.0,3.0,"He's a great teacher that understands how easily lectures can boring. he shows great enthusiasm for the subjects he teaches but also still has fun in the class by telling some of his old war stories. He acts like an ordinary person unlike some professors, understands that life happens. Not an easy A but you'll enjoy it so much it will seem like it."
5849,1620250,3.5,1.0,"I had him for a FYE class, Coaching Strategies. Ridiculously easy class. He's hilarious and never makes us come to class before game-day. Definitely recommend him, no matter what class he is teaching."
5850,1685795,2.0,5.0,"Took him for accelerated comp (1173) which combines comp 1 and 2 into a single semester. Was fine at first, but the last two months were the most excruciating. He did not seem to understand that almost nobody in there was an English major and graded super tough. I went to him for help once, but led be nowhere so I never went to office hours again."
5851,1685795,2.0,5.0,"He doesn't understand the difference between English majors and ANY other major. It's not horrible until you get to the last month. For a 10 page paper, he makes you write in all about 25 pages. If you take Honors Comp 2, there is a 3, 4, 5, and 10-page paper as well as other assignments revolving around them (mostly the 10-page paper)."
5852,1685795,3.0,4.0,"I dont like his teaching style. We go home and read a passage or two and then come to class and discuss what we read. Instead of actually teaching us context and understanding, he just asks us how we interpret something, then proceed to tell us that were wrong, but not how. I see what youre saying, but I dont think thats what the poet means."
5853,1685795,3.0,4.0,"I took Pete for honors comp 2. I made a B. The class was not bad, it was discussion based. I enjoyed it except he grades hard. I made B's on all of my papers I think and I spent a lot of effort on them. He is very accessible through his office hours, but his feedback did not really improve my grade. He does allow for revisions for essays."
5854,1685795,3.0,4.0,"I took him for honors comp 2. He is a pleasant guy but there were so many essays. I felt like essay were graded fairly, and you were given unlimited attempts to revise your essay. The 10 page research paper was worth 30% of your grade but you had the chance to revise that too. Only problem was lots of readings and lots of essays."
5855,1685795,1.0,5.0,Never again
5856,1685795,2.5,4.0,I don't recommend him.
5857,1685795,2.5,4.0,"He gave me an essay back and didn't even tell me what I did wrong.  The classes are long and he lectures until time to leave.  The quizzes are made known, but consist of questions such as ""what poem did this line come from and who is the author?""  You read for every class."
5858,1685795,5.0,3.0,"His class is very interesting. Everything he says is relevant and he makes everything anyone else says relevant. You use the textbook for everything. He moves at a fast pace, but if you can keep up you'll learn a lot. He's also very helpful and is more interested in you learning than just getting the work done, so he'll help you in any way he can."
5859,1685795,3.5,3.0,"He's a nice guy and his Aussie accent makes maintaining attention a lot easier.  He seems interested in what he's teaching though I feel like that will come into play for exams and papers being taken very seriously.  If you can't handle that, he might not be for you!"
5860,2365732,3.0,1.0,"He is a good guy, just not a good professor. He is still young &amp; learning how the teaching component of his job works, because a greater % of his position is research. Overall it is a super easy class, I just think I could have learned more than he offered. The lab was good for learning weed names but very poorly organized making it hard to study."
5861,2677031,5.0,3.0,So so sweet and caring. She's a very fair grader and overall not difficult for a foreign language class. She works with her students to make sure everyone is on the same page. Love Mme Barthes!
5862,2677031,5.0,2.0,Mme. Barthes is amazing! Super sweet and always makes sure everyone understands whats going on. Loves participation. And never be afraid to make a mistake in her class because she never judges you!
5863,2677031,4.0,4.0,Mme. Barthes is a great choice for French. She always goes the extra mile to make sure you have the materials to understand French from different methods of learning. She responds to emails very quickly and is understanding of any issues you have with tech or the material as a whole. Participation is key to succeeding. A solid professor!
5864,1284391,1.0,5.0,This professor is horrible. He does drugs and should get fired asap
5865,1284391,1.0,5.0,"The absolute worst professor I have ever had. I cannot believe that he even has a 3% of people that would return. There is only 4 pop quizzes and he gives so much information. I would genuinely rather walk over legos, run for a year with no break than to ever take this class again. "
5866,1284391,1.0,5.0,He was awfully rude to the ASL interpreter. He is very biased and makes it seem as if he could care less about students and their health. 
5867,1284391,1.0,5.0,Do not take this unless you don’t care about your GPA. The most boring professor with no care at all about his students concerns. 
5868,1284391,1.0,5.0,"Only grades are 4 random pop quizzes throughout year, and although they are hinted when, its not a realistic curriculum for people with jobs and outside life."
5869,1284391,1.0,5.0,Worst professor at MSU.
5870,1284391,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this professor, you will not pass. His class is impossible to do well in. "
5871,1284391,1.0,4.0,4 quizzes 10 points each. There are pop quizzes so you have to attend around test times. I skipped most classes ended with a B. If youre not an audible learner you will struggle. Is sporadic and just writes on whiteboard no book or lecture notes. I Missed 6 questions and got a B. Fun stuff. Im a senior as well one of the worst thus far
5872,1284391,1.0,5.0,The only grades you have in the class are 4 pop quizzes which are 10 questions each. I don't believe that 40 total points would accurately portray what you can learn in a semester. Everyone that I know in the class all failed even when trying to study between the quizzes(that you don't know are going to happen). He doesn't give a curve or extr cred
5873,1284391,1.0,4.0,"Robert Boyd has to be one of the worst professors on campus. He grades you on four pop quizzes that have tricky wording and very specific questions. Attendance is not mandatory, but you have to come to have a shot at passing. It was rumored that he drops your lowest grade, but this is untrue. Do yourself a favor and take a different professor."
5874,1284391,1.0,5.0,this teacher is the worst teacher i have ever had in the my life. he is to old to be teaching in this generation. i never failed a class until this class so if you care about your grades/gpa DONT TAKE THIS CLASS
5875,1284391,1.0,5.0,"I thought you know it can't be that bad from reviews previous, no it's not good please don't take him. He's extremely rude. Terrible lectures, extremely loud(in a bad way) and was rude to the interpreter(for someone in class). Worst professor on campus I rather get hit by a bus than see or hear him again. -1/10."
5876,1284391,1.0,5.0,Please just find another teacher. He is very rude and does not care if the whole class fails.
5877,1284391,1.0,5.0,I would rather step on a lego every day when I get out of bed than sit through one of this man's classes ever again. He finds joy in watching students fail and I firmly believe that. Extremely rude and super unhelpful. Only grades are 4 pop quizzes which are extremely tricky and set you up for failure. No idea how he is still a teacher here.
5878,1284391,1.0,5.0,Do yourself a favor and DO NOT take the worst professor that Mississippi State has to offer.
5879,1284391,1.0,5.0,"Whatever you do, DO NOT take this man's class. He is extremely condescending, rude, and has no regard for his students. The lectures are all over the place. Your grade is based on 4 ten question pop quizzes that are deliberately tricky. There's no extra work and no extra credit. In all honesty, would never wish this class on my worst enemy."
5880,1284391,1.0,5.0,This teacher is so disrespectful and no help at all. I wish I would have checked rate my professor  before adding his class. He is horrible! And has no sympathy for others. The worst teacher I have had at Mississippi State! I HIGHLY recommend you dont take him. Do not jeopardize your Gpa. Find another teacher! Do not take his class please.
5881,1284391,1.0,5.0,no chance to learn. terrible lectures. confusing questions on the quiz. FOUR quizzes are what your overall grade will consist of. nothing else. avoid this dude. pls.
5882,1284391,1.0,5.0,Do yourself a favor and read his reviews. Avoid this professor at all costs. Worst teacher I have ever had that finds joy in failing his students.
5883,1284391,1.0,5.0,Do not take this class at all costs. Drop or find a qualified teacher.
5884,1284391,1.0,5.0,"Sorry excuse for a professor. I have never encountered a professor who does not want to see his student succeed. Messy lectures from beginning to end of class- no class participation or application based work to learn the material. There are 4 pop quizzes, 10 questions each, designed to make you fail. Would not recommend class to my worst enemy."
5885,1284391,1.0,5.0,AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!!! Horrible lectures topped with only 4 pop quiz grades. The quizzes are made to be confusing and impossible to pass. Do not sign up for this professor/drop this class immediately if you have not already done so.
5886,1284391,1.0,5.0,"Boyd lectures from beginning to end of class. No chance for class participation and there's no application-based work to help you learn the material. Your grade is based on four pop quizzes (10 questions each) so if you do poorly on one, you can't save your grade. Quizzes are hard and there's no extra credit. Avoid this class at all costs."
5887,1284391,1.0,5.0,"THE most arrogant &amp; condescending professors I've ever had the displeasure of taking. Clearly dislikes his students &amp; assumes we're lazy half-wits. Lectures are disorganized &amp; sloppy. Never greets his class, cold, &amp; holds himself in very high opinion which is hilarious. Expects to be called a &quot;doctor&quot;. With his unprofessionalism? No thanks."
5888,1284391,1.0,3.0,"Professor Boyd gives off an attitude of being smarter than everyone in his class, yet he is not bright enough to realize that when the only graded assignments you give are pop quizzes, a lot of the class will not be successful, a good professor is a professor who wants to see his students succeed, Professor Boyd is not this type of professor."
5889,1284391,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Boyd is the most unreasonable professor I have ever had. You are only graded on four &quot;pop&quot; quizzes, each one only comprising of 12 questions. They are designed for you to fail. There is no textbook because HE &quot;is the textbook&quot;. He allows no phones in his class, and if he catches you, he will call you out and fail you for the class."
5890,1284391,1.0,4.0,"The level of unnecessary frustration this class caused me was unreal and haunts me to this day. In my opinion, he cares more about proving his dominance than anything. He gives off a god complex vibe. He does not care about his students successes whatsoever. His quizzes are impossible because his lectures aren't helpful. Save yourself from this."
5891,1284391,1.0,4.0,"There's only quizzes, no exams, he is arrogant and says that he is the textbook (okay, well I have never read such a useless, unhelpful, and condescending textbook). Not accessible outside of class, doesn't seem to care about helping out his students. Don't take his classes."
5892,1284391,1.0,5.0,"OMG where do I start??? He over explains simple topics; he spent 30 minutes going over what suburbs are, then spent 25 minutes of the next class reviewing what he said in the previous lecture. I am assuming he thinks the class of mainly women and people of color are too stupid to already know what metropolitan areas are. HE IS AWFUL. AVOID HIM!!!!!"
5893,1284391,1.0,4.0,"Boring Class, 4 quizzes- only good thing is drops lowest quiz grade. Does not email back quickly. Strict. Quizzes are impossible and all the questions are trick questions."
5894,1284391,1.0,4.0,Do not take him. The worst teacher on campus. Can't stress enough how much I regret taking his class.
5895,1284391,1.0,4.0,"Absolutely the worst professor I have ever had in my life. Very rude, no social skills, and seems to genuinely dislike students. I can't convey enough how this is the worst class I have ever taken in my life."
5896,1284391,1.0,4.0,"a large percentage of your grade is left up to him &amp; his opinion of you in class. DO NOT TAKE him. he has said many racist and sexist things in class, take anybody else but him for intro to sociology"
5897,1284391,1.0,4.0,Professor Boyd is really hard to have as a professor. He showed no sympathy after I had a difficult death in my family and counts people as absent from lectures if they check their phone.
5898,1284391,1.0,5.0,"Boyd really likes Sociology, too bad he lacks basic social skills. Ask him questions before or after class? lmao get ignored. His class is made up of 4 &quot;pop quizzes&quot; and a 15% &quot;behavior grade&quot; (no phones/talking grade). If you do make the mistake of taking him, write all the notes and PAY ATTENTION. The only way i made an A was listening in class."
5899,1284391,1.0,3.0,"I respect his content in sociology. However, if you are on your phone, you will hurt your grade basically. His intro to sociology is NOT a hard class. However, he is very introvert and arrogant. Because of this- I felt very out of control of my own grade. Sure, its a decent class. No.... it isn't exactly the most amazing thing ever."
5900,1284391,1.0,5.0,"This guy is the worst! He has literally 4 quizzes and they are EXTREMELY tricky! His notes and lectures are all around the world and NOT very on topic. There is no textbooks because hes going to tell you Hes the textbook. Therefore, you do not need it! Guys, do not take him unless you want to hurt your GPA."
5901,1284391,5.0,3.0,"The professor is passionate about what he teaches and interesting. If you review notes daily, it is easy to get an A in the class."
5902,1284391,1.0,5.0,This is easily the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. He is a terrible teacher and the rudest person I have ever met. He does not care for his students and is not easy to get in touch with. I emailed him on several occassions and he never replied. He literally comes from the pits of hell. WORST TEACHER EVERRRRR
5903,1284391,1.0,3.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN. He is the rudest person i have ever met. He is extremely unhelpful to students and will flat out be disrespectful towards you. He doesnt use the internet AT ALL. So his notes are all hand written on the board (his writing is awful) . Overall he is a terrible professor and not too great of a person either. Please dont take him
5904,1284391,1.0,5.0,This man is literally the worst teach I have ever had in my entire life. He is rude and does not care about anyone at all no matter the situation. His quizzes are extremely tricky and there are only 4 of them. Would not recommend he seriously is just awful.
5905,1284391,1.0,5.0,most difficult class i have ever taken. if you want your gpa to go down then this is the class to take
5906,1284391,5.0,5.0,"His notes aren't helpful. His quizzes are hard because he gives no study guides and the notes aren't helpful. Don't take him, try someone else."
5907,1284391,2.5,4.0,Very loud. Need to pay attention. Would not recommend 
5908,1284391,1.5,4.0,I disliked his class a whole lot. He doesn't give study guides tests are tricky an he is just weird. I don't recommend anyone take him.
5909,1284391,5.0,2.0,"Quite possibly my favorite professor I've ever had. His lectures are informative and to the point, the tests are wordy but fair (gives extra credit for attendance), and he really has a passion for what he teaches, making the class quite interesting. Definitely recommended."
5910,1284391,1.0,4.0,Terrible professor! Only gives pop quizzes that are tricky. Does however give bonus points for coming to class.
5911,1284391,2.5,5.0,NO people skills!
5912,2218282,1.0,3.0,Prepare to teach yourself.
5913,2218282,1.0,2.0,"Prof. Belk didn't care about the problems of the students like most other professors. While most professors are willing to work with you, Belk was rigid. In addition, he jumps from one topic to another during his 3-hour lecture with no linearity. Most students don't understand his lectures and regularly made memes about his poor teaching skills."
5914,2218282,2.0,2.0,Fine lectures but does not seem to care about the students much.
5915,2218282,3.0,3.0,"A good professor, as far as teaching the material goes. Heavy emphasis on MATLAB and slow-paced lectures over a 3 hour period made it hard to pay attention, though. For the first year of ASE, he is required, so it's best to just get through it. The grading is easy and the TAs are helpful, just a matter of getting the right information from lecture."
5916,2218282,2.0,3.0,"Try to avoid this professor. Made me want to switch out of Aerospace. Lectures for the entire 3 hour period about the most random things (for example, one day we had a 2-hour lecture on teamwork) and then the quizzes have hardly anything to do with what he lectured about. Do the homework and you'll pass the class easily."
5917,2218282,2.0,4.0,Hes one of the worst teachers ive ever had. The lecture is 3 hours and he uses all the time to go from random topic to another. Hes not interesting and its very difficult to pay attention and learn anything in his class since he doesnt teach but just talks.
5918,514349,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, Mrs. Liddell was I learned a great amount from her course. Shes always professionally dressed too. BULLDOGS"
5919,514349,4.0,3.0,"I like Mrs. Liddell.  She is a nice lady and a good professor.  Her tests are straight from the book.  She gives quizzes, but they are open note.  She also gives homework assignments through the semester that are interesting and will help you learn.  I am not sure why she has gotten bad ratings.  Many people in our class liked her."
5920,514349,1.5,3.0,terrible rambling teacher. the lectures are hard to follow b/c all she does is ramble about how she likes the girls sweater in the front row or something minute like that.
5921,514349,3.5,4.0,"I really enjoyed listening to her lectures, she is a very funny and interesting lady. Lots of reading and out of class work if you want an A. Her tests are very hard, although sometimes she will give a study guide."
5922,514349,3.0,5.0,"Do not take her course if you only want to go to class, take notes, take the exams, then move on with the rest of college."
5923,2685245,2.0,4.0,If you are just trying to pass the class because it is a prerequisite or required then I do not recommend this professor. Lecture feels rushed but he gives plenty of opportunity to earn bonus points for answering questions during class. He does give practice exams before the test that are a big help but don't try and memorize the practice test. 
5924,801086,2.0,2.0,Recommend. He gets off subject a lot but as long as you read the book the class should not be difficult at all. The group project went by more smoothly than I originally thought. Not the most interesting but not the most difficult either.
5925,801086,2.5,3.0,i took society and the individual just read teh chapters and study what he gives you i suggest you  try to stay awake tho he makes class intersting
5926,801086,4.0,3.0,"Laid back and low-key, but is a pretty smart dood.  You have to do a group project at the end instead of a final exam. My group made it through just fine, but there were some that were painfully bad."

5929,2578756,2.0,2.0,"Least favorite class. She just read off the powerpoints but also showed tons of videos that were distracting from the actual lesson. She also doesn't seem to be very knowledgable about some of the things we talked about. Grades include two tests plus final, all online and open note, discussions, and map quizzes. If you do the work you will be fine."
5930,2578756,5.0,1.0,"Reads off the PowerPoints during lectures which seems pointless. Her class is very easy so if you want an easy A, I highly recommend. Map quizzes every week but are all online, same for exams. This is a freshman class but it feels like a freshman high school class. "
5931,2578756,4.0,1.0,"Her lectures were boring because she just read off the slides which were always posted on canvas to follow along. We had either a map quiz or discussion once every week, and only two tests which was the midterm and final. She was really easy and super nice as well, definitely recommend for a easy class"
5932,2578756,5.0,1.0,"Quite literally the easiest class ever. Every single thing was online, and not honorlocked. Attendance was not mandatory. I suggest everyone takes for a gpa booster. Easiest A ever"
5933,2578756,3.0,2.0,"Overall, she was a nice professor. Her class was just really boring and she read off the powerpoints. We also played Kahoot a lot which some people may like, but I thought was a little bit of a waste of time. She graded pretty easily and the tests weren't hard. "
5934,2578756,3.0,2.0,reads off of the power points. A lot of kahoots. lenient with missed quizzes. Tests and quizzes are all online.
5935,2578756,5.0,2.0,Everything was pretty easy and online. She would open up assignments students missed and was overall super nice.
5936,2578756,5.0,2.0,took for intro world geography. it was very easy. i hardly went to class and passed with an easy A. She only grades off of map quizzes (which you can look up the answers to) &amp; tests.
5937,2578756,3.0,4.0,She was new when I had her so she crammed us with information in every lecture. Super sweet and always ready to answer questions though.
5938,2578756,2.0,3.0,"Avoid taking her if at all possible. She only grades off of map quizzes (which you can look up the answers to) &amp; tests. The tests are very difficult &amp; even though she posts the notes online, no matter how hard you study you still won't pass. She outs random questions on there &amp; expects us to know them when she's never talked about."
5939,694598,4.5,4.0,"I took Dr. Ray Winton's EE8223 Analog Circuits course in the Spring 2010, and Dr. Winton's material is very unique and is not in any text book.  Dr. Winton unique approach bridges device level spice modeles with circuits.  All I can say is that his course was most excellent!  -Herbe Chun"
5940,694598,4.0,3.0,"Winton is a very interesting person.  I liked him, and I am taking more of his classes this fall."

5942,653640,5.0,2.0,"Great class with a very knowledgeable and willing instructor! If you are interested in weather forecasting or meteorology then take Doug's weather forecasting courses! He likes snow, severe and tropical meteorology! He has hard tests but drills the students with the pertinent test info! I made an A and learned alot about forecasting!"
5943,1620311,1.0,3.0,"I'm a straight A student (even in very difficult classes), but I found myself frustrated with what should've been an ""easy A"" class. Grading criteria was not clear, and some of the ""grades"" we should've been given according to the syllabus were never given. Lectures were long. You'll want to study using the book, but all of the questions were MC."
5944,1620311,4.0,1.0,Had him for PR writing. Very easy class & he explains things very well. Very nice guy
5945,1620311,2.0,3.0,"He's okay.. but he isn't that great at communicating so he really needs to be in the class as well.  His tests aren't hard, true/false and multiple choice. Pick an easier teacher."
5946,2750826,5.0,2.0,"I took Dr. Pugh for HON Public Policy Leadership, and it was the coolest class I've taken at MSU! Every class we had a new special guest, from local office holders to national politicians, and your grade is pretty much determined by your participation in their presentations. Only two assignments are a midterm and final project - Dr. Pugh is great!!"
5947,2447723,5.0,4.0,"I believe Dr. Scott is the best Chemistry professor at this school because she goes into detail about why and how everything we learn in this class is applicable to real life. She is the most caring and helpful teacher I have ever had, and if you truly try your hardest - I guarantee you she will always be there to help you whenever you need it."
5948,2447723,2.0,5.0,"Extremely hard class but the teaching could be a lot better. Mostly reads from slides and gives basic concepts. Dr. Cui made all the exams and put material on exams that werent even covered in her class. No homework grade so class is extremely test heavy. No curves, no extra credit, no rounding whatsoever"
5949,2447723,4.0,5.0,"Orgo II is going to be hard no matter who is teaching it, but Dr. Scott adds some humor to her lectures which made them more bearable. She does not curve tests or offer extra credit, however. You will definitely need the textbook to review material from the lectures, as she goes quite quickly through them."
5950,2447723,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Scott was a solidly average teacher for an exceptionally difficult subject. Her lectures were a little over-reliant on the slides at times, but if you stuck it out and paid attention, she would give additional explanations that were actually very helpful. Listen in class, go to her review sessions, and work really hard and you'll be fine."
5951,2685300,4.0,2.0,"This was a fairly easy online class. There were 3 assignments for the chapter each week: a discussion, a quiz, and a quick assignment. There was also a test every few chapters that were on lockdown browser. They were all fairly easy and we got a drop discussion, quiz, assignment, and test. If you put in a little effort you should pass the class."
5952,2677134,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Seitz is an AMAZING professor! She truly loves what she does and is always willing answer questions before, during and after class (be it in person, through webex or email). She is very down to earth and is very knowledgeable about everything she teaches. So long as you put forth effort you will do well in this class! "
5953,2677134,5.0,3.0,I had Dr. Seitz for Elements of Persuasion and it was such a treat. Dr. Seitz not only is brilliant but is also is such a sweetheart. There were two textbooks for the class but I found that if you took notes and went over the PowerPoints you got all the information you needed for tests. As long as you complete the assignments on time you'll do well
5954,2062735,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lang is a fantastic teacher and gives great lectures, but he only gives out around 6 total grades for the whole semester. Don't miss an assignment, like I did. If you read the readings and go to the lectures, you will do fine. He isn't super critical on your writings, and he shows a real passion for his subject. Take good notes and you're fine."
5955,2062735,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Lang was an amazing history professor for the Civil War course I took this semester. While he is tough, I expected that being it is a senior level Civil War course. He is a great professor and is someone who really cares about history and can tie it back into the modern world. Would definitely take him again."
5956,2062735,4.0,4.0,I give Mr. Lang a high rating solely because he is gives GREAT lectures. I hate anything involving history but his voice in lectures made me want to listen and he did a great job explaining and connecting historical events. Mr. Lang was nice enough to give essay questions to prepare before the test but the multiple choice I always thought was hard.
5957,2062735,5.0,4.0,"Passionate about the class. READ THE PRIMARY SOURCES!! Heavy lecturer. Papers for each exam and outside readings. Extra credit was offered, but is not usually offered."
5958,2062735,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Lang often goes off on long tangents during his lectures. His presentations are very confusing, sounding more like he is reading a story rather than giving a lecture. Due to this, getting notes from lecture is very hard and requires undivided attention at all times. Very hard format to get used to considering this is a freshman level class."
5959,2062735,2.0,1.0,"Boring,"
5960,2062735,3.5,4.0,"Dr. Lang is very passionate about history, which makes his lectures interesting most of the time. The TA you get will make or break the class. Weekly reading assignments with pop quizzes. Take good notes and really, really know your stuff because the exams are only essay. Simple class, work hard if not a natural at history. Some extra credit."
5961,2726287,5.0,1.0,Very easy class and a very good professor.
5962,2726287,5.0,2.0,"Was very understanding about missing assignments/retaking them if you forgot to take a quiz. I took him online, but super easy and wants his students to succeed. Would recommend!"
5963,2537876,3.0,3.0,"He tries his best to make it interesting but the class is boring. He posts all notes online so you really dont have to show up or pay attention. He doesnt care if you play on your phone. His tests are surprisingly difficult, but he gives extra credit and he will curve you at the end if youre close to the next letter grade."
5964,2537876,5.0,3.0,"He is absolutely awesome. He was so helpful and accessible outside of class. His tests are fine if you study the slides he gives- the powerpoints are straightforward, and he will discuss them in-depth in class. I hated the material, but he made the class actually interesting even for a humanities person like me. I'd recommend him to anyone."
5965,2537882,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Ali is young and fun, he is foreign, so kind of hard to understand but his notes are very simple to understand, he gives an outline of the test notes and if you look over the powerpoint before the tests, you will pass. He is such a sweetheart!"
5966,1202595,5.0,3.0,He is truly such a great professor. I had him at 8am and I wouldn't fall asleep in his class ever. He is always so entertaining and is so passionate about the material he is teaching. I would definitely recommend reading the assigned discussion class reading so you can be better prepared for the in class essays. 
5967,1202595,5.0,2.0,loe=ve
5968,1202595,5.0,1.0,"Even though I took this 8 am, he definitely livened up my mornings. Dr. Giesen is a very funny man, and even though that statements doesn't give him credibility as a professor, it's a factor that does play into the way his lectures are delivered. The lectures tie into the reading you do on your own every week, which seems like a lot, but its simple"
5969,1202595,5.0,4.0,his lectures are easy to get in to
5970,1202595,5.0,3.0,"The best professor I have ever had. Yes the readings are lengthy, but I would take this class 100 more times if I could."
5971,1202595,5.0,3.0,"I took this class is The HUMP and he made it great. He also gave us incentive to come to class by slingshotting t-shirts. Anyway, if you can take this guy, do it. Be prepared to write, but it is not difficult. 1 prompt a week with ample time to complete the task. Read the textbook and pay attention to the lectures. It will payoff come test day."
5972,1202595,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Giesen is my favorite history professor at MSU. His class is so interesting and he makes the material very enjoyable to learn about. There is a lot of reading in this class and there is a short paper due every week, but you have a TA discussion class to help you with that. Dr. Giesen is a great lecturer and a fun teacher. Highly recommend!!"
5973,1202595,5.0,2.0,"I loved having this professor's class. His lectures are super interesting and it makes it very easy to pay attention. We have to read a few documents and write a paper on it each week, but they are honestly not bad at all. This semester he did multiple choice tests, which were easy, but he normally does essay tests, so that is something to consider"
5974,1202595,5.0,3.0,"I love Dr. Giesen! He's an amazing professor and actually cares about his students. Since COVID, class was mostly online, but he somehow joined our GroupMe and give us tips and advice. He even wrote us a poem about our final, which was super funny."
5975,1202595,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Giesen does a great job giving lectures. If you attend his class and lectures, then you will do fine. There is one HW assignment a week, and 3 tests. He does a great job of you understanding history and connecting it rather than memorizing it. Very useful class"
5976,1202595,5.0,4.0,"My experience was impacted by Covid (and my class was 800+ people). Makes lectures fun to listen to, and easier to understand. Lots of textbook reading (40+ pages a week sometimes), Tests were multiple choice/online, Even though the tests were online, the questions were still difficult, He brought a slingshot to give away shirts so that's fun."
5977,1202595,4.0,4.0,"You will make it out of his class with a good grade as long as you put in the effort. You must watch/ listen to his lectures to do well on the tests. The weekly essays are graded hard, but you will do good on them if you pay attention."
5978,1202595,3.0,4.0,Weekly Essays/Submission and it is graded very hard.
5979,1202595,5.0,4.0,I really looked forward to going to Dr. Giesen's lectures. He was always enthusiastic about history. Be prepared to use pencil and paper for note taking if you're used to taking notes on a tablet or computer as he doesn't allow electronics. Reading the textbook is not only beneficial but required to be successful. Overall a great history professor.
5980,1202595,5.0,3.0,"His lectures honestly changed how I viewed history class. In the past, I had always dreaded going to history but I always looked forward to going to Dr. Giesen's class. Be ready to write essays for tests."
5981,1202595,5.0,3.0,Dr. Giesen was a fantastic Professor I had my Freshman year of Fall 2019. HES a fantastic guy and his lectures were really interesting for anyone. By prepared to write exams in Blue Books as if you were writing short essays. Only student to laugh during his lecture about Woodstock and a man getting run over by a tractor in a field. Ask him about it
5982,1202595,5.0,4.0,"He is an amazing lecturer. If you can get him for modern US history, I highly highly recommend it."
5983,1202595,4.0,2.0,"Does not post slides. Great lectures that do not concern dates or names, but more of the impact events had on the people and social norms. 3 essay exams where its just like you're talking to a friend about what you know and they're not super technical. Discussion sections on mandatory readings."
5984,1202595,4.0,4.0,"Attendance is important because he doesnt post slides online , he doesnt post grades on canvas either you have to keep up with them yourself. Exams are all written exams (3 key terms and an essay). He gives you the key terms a week before the exam , STUDY THEM. Go to SI, he has zero tolerance for use of electronics during lecture"
5985,1202595,5.0,3.0,"a really good professor. his lectures are great, and he keeps you engaged by adding humor in each one. very passionate. the textbook is also online so that saves money."
5986,1202595,5.0,2.0,"This class was great! Even though he lectures every class the whole time, he makes his powerpoints funny and interesting so you aren't bored to death. He is very strict with no electronics so bring your paper and pencil! He also doesn't post the power points so be sure to take good notes. The tests are always 2-4 short answer key terms and 1 essay."
5987,1202595,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Giesen is the BEST. Everyone at State needs to take him at least once. There is a reading, and there are in-class writings randomly, but Giesen changed the way I felt about history. His lectures are amazing. He is a really funny guy and keeps his lectures interesting."
5988,1202595,5.0,3.0,Professor Giesen makes history worthwhile with his lectures. It's nonstop entertainment along with education.
5989,1202595,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Giesen changed my entire perspective on history. I honestly hated the subject before college, but his approach to teaching it gave me a new found love of it. Make sure to read your documents thoroughly before breakout sessions and STUDY YOUR IDS BEFORE THE TESTS. #whothedeuce (if you took the class you get it)"
5990,1202595,5.0,4.0,"An amazing professor, will definitely teach you a lot, and he is very interesting."
5991,1202595,4.0,4.0,One of the funniest guys ever. Lectures the whole 50 minutes but it goes by pretty fast. Make sure you take good notes because tests are hard; you'll need to study a lot. Make sure you develop a connection with your TA because they read and grade all your tests and pop assignments.
5992,1202595,5.0,4.0,He is so awesome. He keeps the lectures interesting and funny. 10/10 recommend to everyone. As far as grading goes.. it's just luck of the draw bc the TA's grade
5993,1202595,4.0,4.0,"Gieson is hilarious, and I really enjoyed taking his class. That being said, you have to work for it. If you skip more than three classes, your grade will suffer. Also, he does not post any of the lectures online so you have to know somebody. He also is really big on technology use in class and does not allow computers or cellphones at all."
5994,1202595,5.0,5.0,"Amazing professor! His lectures keep you on your toes, and he keeps his opinions very limited. Funny, and attractive!"
5995,1202595,5.0,1.0,His lectures are awesome! He presents all of his material clearly and in an interesting way. The class didn't take much effort for me to Ace it but I throughly enjoyed it!
5996,1202595,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher and lectures. Incorporates music into lectures to make them more interesting. As long as you read the chapters or go to the lectures (and take notes) then you will pass. There is writing involved in the course, but as long as you know the material then you will be fine."
5997,1202595,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Giesen is one of the most liberal minded professors that I have ever had. For those students from Mississippi (myself included), he will talk down to you and your state. He has far fetched ideas and beliefs that he does not have legitimate sources for. Dr. Giesen will try to convince you that your beliefs and views are of the past."
5998,1202595,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Giesen is by far my favorite professor I have ever had. He taught history in a way that I have never heard it taught before and he kept the class engaged. He had an incredible way of making the 300 person class feel much smaller. You will definitely have to work for your grade, it is not an easy A at all. "
5999,1202595,4.5,1.0,"I would definitely recommend Dr. Giesen. He made History at 8 am extremely interesting, which is hard to do. His tests are just writing papers, but if you listen in class then you should have no problem getting an A. "
6000,1202595,1.0,4.0,"Worst professor I've had in my 4 years. Ruined what should have been a really interesting class by turning it into something it wasn't designed to be. If you have the chance, stay away from this guy. "
6001,1202595,2.0,5.0,"Mississippi history, he makes Mississippi look like we are still in slavery times"
6002,1202595,4.5,1.0,No Comments
6003,2283948,5.0,4.0,"I took this class last year and it was interesting. She shows videos, plays music sometimes, and wants the class to have discussions. You have to read a lot and come to class, but the papers are not too long and she grade fair if you try."
6004,2283948,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Greenes class is far from easy, but she also helped more than any other professor Ive had. She met with me many times outside of class and provided really helpful feedback that enabled me to write something better than I ever thought I was capable of doing. I truly enjoyed what I learned in her class."
6005,2283948,5.0,4.0,Challenging class but organized and I'm happy with how my research paper turned out. Got lots of feedback on my project and never had trouble getting in touch with the professor for help.
6006,2349485,4.0,4.0,"I dropped this class to switch majors, but he is great. Speaks low, so make sure you get a seat at the front. Is happy to clear up anything that is confusing and explains things well. He saw that I wasn't doing well on the quizzes, so he asked to talk to me after class and offered to help me understand the information during office hours."
6007,2349485,4.0,3.0,"He speaks at a very low volume, but he is extremely accommodating to those students who make the extra effort to clarify material with him. He is willing to stop the flow of class, or even alter his lesson plan for the week simply because he realizes there is a topic that he needs to spend time clarifying. Overall he cares alot for his students."
6008,2349485,1.0,4.0,"He's a newer teacher and he teaches his student as if they already know how to do this stuff. I'm fairly new to programming and I have no idea what hes talking about half the time. He mainly teaches in larger classrooms and then writes on the board in size 2 font. We keep asking him to write larger, but he goes back to writing small the next day."
6009,2505148,4.0,2.0,I took him June 2019. You will have to study to receive an A. It's not impossible. You don't need the book if you pay attention in class. I didn't buy the book.
6010,2062829,1.0,5.0,Would not recommend her ever worst instructor 
6011,2062829,1.0,1.0,Her class is not hard by any stretch of the imagination but she just has a terrible attitude and is not willing to help students whatsoever. You are on your own in this class. Do not bother emailing her as you will just receive a rude email in return that does not address any of your questions or concerns. If you have to take her: best of luck. 
6012,2062829,3.0,1.0,"The class is very easy, but it feels like it is her first time teaching a course! She seems little prepared, but she is very easy to communicate with! She will help when asked, but you should always come to class!Overall, it was an okay class! Just make sure to proofread everything and try to meet up during office hours if you want a super high A."
6013,2062829,2.0,1.0,"I took accelerated comp 2 for english 1&amp;2 credits, so definitely go that route if your ACT is high enough. This class was so easy. She is an easy grader as long as you stick to the essay prompts. Nobody in my class ever read the required works for each class and we still all passed. The fact that I get two course credits for this is insane lol."
6014,2062829,5.0,3.0,Great teacher.
6015,2062829,1.0,1.0,This teacher is the absolute worse!! I would not recommend taking this teacher. I literally had to call my professor from EMCC to help me!! She relies too much on the textbook. Its an online class which makes it even worse. Shes no help.
6016,2062829,1.0,5.0,Okay so just run the other way. There were many different moments when I would email her to ask questions about something and I wouldn't get a response until a few days after it was due. I never heard her voice once throughout the entire semester. She has no care in the world for the well-being of her students and relies on the textbook too much.
6017,2062829,1.0,5.0,"College is the best 4 years of your life. She made it the best 3.5 years of my life. If you need help, email her. If you email her, she does respond well and will help you... 3+ hours later. I thought I understood grammar. Before taking this class, I thought people were over exaggerating this tough it is. Turns out, they were under exaggerating."
6018,2062829,1.0,5.0,If you have the option do not take this professor. I have literally cried so many times in this class and I don't cry about classes. It is a lot of information that you have to retain and it does not help that it is only an online class
6019,2062829,1.0,5.0,"If you actually want to learn to teach grammar, dont take her. I learned all the information from the workbook and YouTube videos. She didnt lecture and hardly ever responded to emails. Her tests and homework are weighed way more than they should be, and the PowerPoints she posts arent helpful. 100/10 wouldnt recommend this professor."
6020,2062829,1.0,5.0,No. Do yourself a favor and do not take her. I was in her online teaching grammar class. She uploads short powerpoints but thats it. The textbook taught me more. She didnt teach me how to teach grammar. She just tested me on my grammar knowledge. Her tests are 40% of the grade while the final is 15% for some reason. Test questions are tricky.
6021,2062829,1.0,5.0,"Not sure how anyone would get above a B in this class. The textbook is the main source of information, she does not lecture, and is not great at responding to emails. Would definitely recommend NOT taking her if you have the option. I worked my butt off in this class and still managed to barely pass. Also didnt learn a thing about teaching grammar"
6022,2062829,1.0,5.0,She does not teach the subject. She gives you certain papers to fill out and doesn't teach you how to do them and then gets mad when you are confused.
6023,2062829,1.0,5.0,"She expected us to learn from 12 page powerpoints and the tests were insanely hard. She doesn't respond to emails in a timely manner even though the class is all online, and if you do not format the emails like she wants she will not respond. If you can take any other class besides this one do it, she is not a good teacher nor does she care."
6024,2062829,2.0,4.0,She is a tough grader but is willingly to help
6025,2062829,1.0,5.0,"It is hard to learn grammar, especially by just reading the books/PPs on your own time. This professor did not post a single lecture video, even after multiple students asked if she could. The homework really won't help your grade at all, but it will for sure hurt it."
6026,2062829,1.0,4.0,"she is not nice at all and shows not care for her students or their success. your grade is basically based on the 3 tests and they don't even match what we were learning about. she also does not give you any opportunities to bring up your. grade if you have a bad day and don't score as well as you like. whatever you do , DO NOT take her."
6027,2062829,1.0,4.0,Her lectures were not very interesting. The tests were kind of confusing. Be prepared for discussion boards every week. Graded very hard on Critical Analysis paper. Would not recommend.
6028,2062829,4.0,3.0,"Ms. Thompson is a really nice professor. In the beginning there is a lot of reading, but after the second half of the semester, there is barely any homework. Do the assigned reading because she sometimes gives pop quizzes over the material. You have 3 major papers (plus a annotated bibliography) which is the majority of your grade."
6029,2062829,1.0,2.0,absolutely nothing
6030,2062829,3.0,4.0,"She will give you help if you need and ask for it, but she isn't particularly lenient. Read the necessary stories, write your papers, ask her for feedback, go to the writing center for help. Will give pop quizzes about readings, so go to class. No exams, but multiple papers that count for a very large portion of your grade."
6031,2062829,2.0,4.0,"She stood in one spot the whole time. She is also very unforgiving when it comes to accidental mistakes. However, she gives good feedback and explains how to do things ONLY after you've turned an assignment in. This class was pretty boring and I definitely wouldn't recommend her for fun."
6032,2062829,5.0,1.0,"There's only four major essays plus some short, easy homework assignments. Participation is important, so participating in discussion is key, but on the flip side, the discussions are pretty fun and interesting. The readings she assigns aren't very long, and in general she's a very easy person to get along with."
6033,2062829,4.0,2.0,Proessor Thompson is super easy to take for Accerelerated Comp. We only have 4 major essays due in the semester.
6034,2062829,3.0,3.0,Her class itself is okay. Lecture is pretty easy and homework is normally reading with few to little assignments. She does a good job of getting the class involved in readings. She's really easy to talk to if you have an issue and this class isnt too difficult for two credits.
6035,2062829,2.0,4.0,"The class was pretty boring. She stood in one spot and lectured from her notes with her head down. Didnt really set any class expectations. Everyone was basically on their phone/laptops the whole time. The material was easy, but her class was just extremely boring."
6036,2562542,5.0,3.0,Best professor at the university. Hands down. 
6037,2562542,3.0,2.0,Good professor. Handwriting could be neater but pay attention and you will pass.
6038,2562542,5.0,1.0,I have had Calvin for multiple Aerospace related courses. He is a great professor that is well versed in the aerospace field. He is also a great person who will help you out in any way possible as long as you show effort in his classes. I would take every single class with Walker as my professor if it was possible. Have to have him at least once.
6039,2562542,5.0,2.0,"I would take every class with Calvin Walker if given the opportunity. He's a great lecturer and very knowledgeable regarding aeronautics. The tests were very similar to the homework, and tests were open-note. If you do the homework, you'll do very well. I hardly studied and walked out with an A."
6040,2562542,5.0,3.0,Great choice for dynamics. Posted notes and lectures online with recommended hw problems that are identical to the test. Rights in cursive so it can sometimes be a little hard to read but overall great teacher.
6041,2562542,4.0,2.0,Took him online during the summer. He replied to questions via email very quickly and with written out work to provide explanantion. VERY lenient grader. Super kind person! Posted lectures online and could watch on your own time.
6042,2562542,5.0,3.0,"One of the few professors left that care more about teaching the students the material and making sure they understand rather than just throwing tests at them. he is extremely approachable and is always willing to answer any questions (just not stupid ones, he will embarrass you)."
6043,2562545,1.0,5.0,"Avoid like the plague. Pretty sure half his class didn't pass. He couldn't care less about the students, and he has no idea how to properly convey the material. His tests are 3x times harder than the average department test, and he grades ruthlessly."
6044,1047030,4.0,2.0,"Had her for Spanish 1. She is really nice and her class was enjoyable for me. Very understanding. Lots of Homework on Mindtap, but it doesn't take long at all. Have to go to class because attendance is for a grade and she gives in-class quizzes. This class is especially easy if you had Spanish in high school."
6045,1047030,4.0,2.0,"Mrs. Dyer was a wonderful teacher this past semester. She showed me how to study her notes, tricks and tips to remember certain words, and was just an overall fun person to be around. She is always willing to make office hours with you. If you go to class, participate in class, and go over your vocabulary each night, you'll excel in this class."
6046,1047030,3.5,3.0,Pollish chick that is by far one of the coolest professors at MSU! She is extremely helpful if you need it.
6047,2488829,4.0,3.0,"Bashford really is a great teacher! Her lectures are clear and concise, however there are some tricky questions on exams. Most of the time they're easy to figure out. There is a lot of homework for each unit usually lasting about 5 hours.  She does have a small issue with admitting fault when issues arise. otherwise she'd get a 5 from me. "
6048,2488829,1.0,1.0,Worst math teacher . rude and doesn't care about her students .She doesn't not meet but just 5 mins she always talks about her life . the meeting was rushy. Has a bad attiude . I don't recommend her at all . she smirks when u ask her for help.
6049,2488829,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Bashford for a four week calculus course, and she was a phenomenal professor! Super accessible and really enjoys what she does; its obvious that she wants her students to do well! Gave extra credit on our midterm and final for attendance, and lectures were interesting and well-explained! Would definitely take again."
6050,2488829,4.0,3.0,you do have a lot of homework however the homework does help a lot when it comes to taking the test. she is very clear on how many points you need to get the grade you want. It is not a hard class at all and she doesn't make you want to fall asleep. I recommend her.
6051,2488829,5.0,4.0,one of the best math teachers i have ever had. she post the notes and if you study them and attend office hours you will make a good grade. her notes are the test
6052,2488829,4.0,3.0,"Covid may have changed my experience, but she was a wonderful teacher. At every opportunity asked if anyone had questions and would even stay after class for people to ask questions. I found the subject itself pretty easy, but it definitely helps to go to the lectures and DO THE HOMEWORK! The hw is where you learn what you do not know for tests."
6053,2488829,5.0,2.0,"Professor Bashford is one of the easiest teachers in the math department. Just show up to class and come to her when you have questions, she is more than happy to help. If your one that does not like a funny/interesting lectures then she is not for you. She also holds you the entire class time."
6054,2488829,4.0,3.0,"I took Hannah for college algebra my 1st semester. She is a really good teacher. She does spend a lot of time talking about her personal life and she tells stories, but she still got her job done. It is an easy class as along as you go to class, take notes, and pay attention."
6055,2488829,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Bashford is hands down the BEST college algebra teacher. Her lectures and notes are super easy to understand. Everything is taken online in MyLabsPlus, which is super nice because nearly everything is multiple choice, especially the tests. Every unit has around 40-60 homework problems, but you won't pass. Take notes, do HW, and you'll get an A."
6056,2488829,4.0,4.0,"She is an amazing teacher. You have to pay attetnion to understand what is going on in the class. I did not put a lot of effort at first but as soon as I started paying attention, things go so much better."
6057,2488829,5.0,4.0,"I have loved being in her class! Shes super easy to understand and makes it super easy for you to get help if you need it. Theres always homework, but it helps solidify a topic if you need more time to understand it. Her stories are entertaining and amusing! Take her if you get her on your schedule you wont regret it!"
6058,2488829,3.0,3.0,"I mean she's OKAY, just okay, not great. Talks a lot in class and will sometimes help you out. Defiantly a nice lady but just not for me. I really wanted to like her but I just couldn't."
6059,2488829,5.0,3.0,"I. Love. Her. I have had her for two different math courses and she is always super understanding if you are struggling in the class. She tries to help in any way she can and she makes sure we understand the material. She does tell stories a lot, but they usually help give your brain a break from all the crazy stuff going on. 10/10 recommend"
6060,2488829,3.0,4.0,She's fine but her integrals look like a big S and that really bothers me
6061,2488829,5.0,4.0,"Wrote this while she was telling one of her stories, which I love by the way. They always lighten the mood and makes the math more fun. She is always willing to help if you are feeling stuck or behind. Amazing professor and I recommend."
6062,2488829,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Bashford is an amazing professor. She is really kind and caring. She always posts her notes on Canvas. She makes class really enjoyable, while the information is sometimes hard she tries her best to make the class environment fun and energetic."
6063,2488829,4.0,3.0,"I like her stories. Theyre awkward sometimes, but its good to know that not everyone has a picture-perfect life. Ive never been great at math, but I can honesty say that she presents the information in an understandable manner. I have definitely learned and improved from the class."
6064,2488829,5.0,2.0,"Looking at all of the ratings, I completely agree with them. Except for that one bad one. Ms. Bashford is a GREAT professor. She always helps out in class and constantly checks for clarification before moving to a harder topic. Great teacher to take for College Algebra and Business Calculus!"
6065,2488829,5.0,2.0,"She is probably the best Math professor I have ever had. She never looks down on you if you aren't doing very good and is pretty supportive. She always tells funny anecdotes, and while I haven't gone to her office hours personally, she always reminds us of them. She gives us plenty of time for studying and is always willing to help."
6066,2488829,5.0,3.0,Ms. Bashford is a great professor. She is always willing to help and always tries to make her classes engaging. Her random stories are always funny and a nice break when you're learning a lot of information. She is always giving 110% even when the student starts slacking off. I know this first hand when I am struggling or when I am behind.
6067,2488829,5.0,1.0,She is an AWESOME professor. Her stories are absolutely hilarious and she is such a great teacher. I have learned so much in her class and I highly recommend her class.
6068,2488829,2.0,1.0,She will waste half of the class telling stories that dont relate to the topic she is attempting to teach. Youll learn more through my labs plus than in class and expect to get annoyed throughout the entire semester. Good luck if you end up with her in your schedule.
6069,2488829,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Bashford is easily my favorite professor this semester. She gives clear notes that explain topics well. Shes very quirky and likes to tell random stories, which makes the class interesting. The class itself isnt the easiest thing ever, but if you pay attention to the notes and do the homework you should be ok."
6070,391677,4.0,3.0,"Took his graduate classes and he was very  knowledgeable in his field, thorough in his instruction, and eager to help  clarify any misunderstandings. I would highly recommend ANY of his classes."
6071,391677,5.0,3.0,Great prof.  Very energetic and helpful.  Hard not to like going to class when he is the teacher.
6072,391677,5.0,1.0,really nice guy-can be kinda funny. history was definitely not boring in his class..he made it really interesting.gives 2 papers during the semester and u chose which you'd prefer to do. quizzes are really easy. he is very fair and gives opportunities to improve your grade.
6073,391677,1.0,5.0,egomaniac
6074,391677,5.0,4.0,He knows his stuff. He gets you into the subject and you like going to class. He's passionate about what he teaches and is a Civil War historian.
6075,391677,5.0,2.0,"Very informative about his subject, very fair, his lectures are extremely entertaining and informative. One of the best history professors I've had so far. Very friendly and easy to talk to."
6076,391677,4.0,2.0,Very fair and helpful
6077,391677,5.0,2.0,No Comments
6078,2349569,4.0,3.0,I would've gotten an A if I had studied for the final. Ms. Rachel is awesome. She made calculus very easy to understand. She's fun and very energetic most days. I didn't use the textbook. All hw and quizzes are online.
6079,2349569,4.0,4.0,"Calculus is in general not an easy class. She explains everything very well and tries to make it fun. But to understand it you NEED to come to class. If you have less than three absences she replaces lowest test with grade on final exam (very helpful). For a math professor, she was really great. Homework and quizzes were all on MyLabsPlus!"
6080,2750991,4.0,3.0,Pretty easy class if you show up
6081,2750991,3.0,3.0,"Overall this was a fairly easy class. You have weekly homework of 5-10 questions straight from the book. She brings in guest anthropologist speakers that you will take notes on and then write a recap of their lecture for a grade. The tests are difficult, but if you do all of your other work they won't hurt you too bad."
6082,1915410,1.0,4.0,I hate her classes. But she teaches certain classes required so they are non-optional. I always dread taking them. So much reading and writing. Should be worth more credit hours. So much work outside of class.
6083,1915410,4.0,4.0,Great professor. Her lectures were very good and very easy to watch. A LOT of reading. Be prepared to read a lot of articles. I feel like there were too many articles. I would definitely take another class with this professor though.
6084,1915410,1.0,4.0,"4 exams, that's the whole class 4 exams in the whole summer semester. This isn't learning it's studying. Take a different professor if you can take someone who will teach also. You end up doing reviews and spending time on them for nothing, they don't even get graded and the test questions don't even match."
6085,1915410,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Sherman-Morris had done a great job responding to questions and always encouraging students that participation matters. I enjoyed her Weather &amp; Society class, it was a very interesting course!"
6086,1915410,3.0,2.0,She's very nice and does a job.  Be prepared for a lot of um's!
6087,1915410,1.0,1.0,"She seems lost as the Administrator of TIG and AMP. The programs have deteriorated under her watch. The class is her philosophic view of the material, and if you stray from her perspective, you will fall out of favor."
6088,1915410,5.0,1.0,Questions come straight from the text/lectures. I like that she basically forced interaction between classmates.
6089,1915410,3.0,2.0,"I took 2 of her online classes. This and Advanced Hazards and Disasters. The way she teaches was similar for both. There was a ton of reading for both like academic papers and such. She'll give you homework assignments. Answer them thoroughly because they're essential for any assessments. Also, these classes felt like philosophy classes at times. "
6090,1915410,1.0,1.0,BORING! Needs to work on her lecture presentation skills.... be a bit more animated.  Videos were boring. Research methods needed to have more on research skills and less on philosophy.
6091,1309211,5.0,4.0,I highly recommend Mrs. Dueitt. She gives very clear instructions on what she is looking for on every paper and is very caring and understanding. She usually has your paper graded the same day you turn it in. She also bought the whole class chick-fil-a at the end of the semester.
6092,1309211,4.0,2.0,"We would write little one page summaries of a story we read for homework then she would discuss the story in class. Ended with a group project on poetry analysis. As long as you show up to hear what she says, you can easily regurgitate it on the test. Her class was very open and she offers a few extra credits!"
6093,1309211,4.0,3.0,Ms. Dueitt is a great teacher. She makes sure you understand the topic and allows for a lot of participation. She is also very caring and will do her best to help you without pushing the boundaries of straight up telling you the answer/what's wrong. She gave us more work than other sections but still made the class fun and interesting.
6094,1309211,5.0,3.0,"Comp 2 with mrs dueitt was a JOY. As long as you try you'll pass. A lot of class discussions, but she really is a talented teacher and is very helpful."
6095,1309211,5.0,3.0,Very nice professor and is willing to help you with anything!
6096,1309211,4.0,4.0,"I thought she was really nice and funny. I would take her again for any class tbh. Whatever you do, don't slack off in the class. You slack off, you get a not so good grade. You have to give effort to get results."
6097,1309211,5.0,2.0,"I strongly recommend taking this professor. The lectures were enjoyable, and tests and papers were very straight forward. She is more than willing to help outside of class and provides specific feedback."
6098,1309211,5.0,2.0,Very helpful teacher! She will talk out anything you don't understand and will help you with anything you have questions on. Her work load isn't terrible and her class is one I actually enjoy going to! Love her!
6099,1309211,2.5,5.0,"If you're taking her for accelerated comp 2, she is extremely hard. You won't make an A. She simply won't allow it. I had all of my papers edited by other english teachers/always asked her to help me with them and she still gave me Bs. I got As on every test and classwork. You're better off taking two semesters with an easy english professor."
6100,1309211,5.0,1.0,SHE is great
6101,1309212,5.0,4.0,I learned a lot in this class. I recomend Craven to whoever is wanting to take Art Appreciation.
6102,1309212,5.0,1.0,EASY! Tests come right from the powerpoints that he sends you via email days before the tests. Class is a waste of time but he's a nice guy. Easy A class.
6103,1309212,1.0,5.0,"tests are very hard, classes are so boring waste of time and all he talks about is himself"
6104,1309214,2.0,4.0,"Dr. B's class gave me the most stress for art appreciation. I expected to go in and appreciate art, not be forced to learn about every single piece of art, its artist, and why they did the artwork. I would not take it again. She gives essays throughout the class which she grades so tough. Not worth it. Take another professor for art appreciation"
6105,1309214,1.0,5.0,"Whatever you do, dont take her class. Just dont do it. Mean person and takes pride in her meanness. Ridiculously extensive grading criteria that makes it nearly impossible to follow all directions, extremely strict attendance policy, unbelievably dull lectures, makes the subject matter dull. Additionally, shes just a rude and mean person overall"
6106,1309214,4.0,2.0,"This class didn't require the memorization of dates, but I know her Art History I class does. She's pretty easy, but instead of having a final at the end of the semester, we had group projects."
6107,1309214,4.0,2.0,She had a great understanding for the subject she taught in Art History II. Most of the time she lectured. All you have to do is pay attention in class and do the homework and you'll be fine.
6108,1309214,4.0,3.0,You have to memorize a lot of dates so definitely don't procrastinate.  Some people find the class boring but I really enjoy it and the way she teaches.
6109,1931811,5.0,4.0,"Dr Raj is an amazing professor. The class I took with him was difficult so it wasn't a &quot;fun&quot; class but I learned tons and enjoyed the struggle. Don't skip class, if he sees you working he will give you everything that he can with his time and extra points. He spent many many hours outside of normal class hours to help us with homework and test prep"
6110,1931811,4.0,4.0,He is a harsh teacher and really expects a lot from you but he will bend over backwards to make sure you understand. 
6111,2284072,1.0,5.0,"Only gives negative feedback. Figure everything out for yourself because she will not help at all. Models everything teachers should NOT be. Grading is unpredictable and mirrors her mood. If you don't answer questions the EXACT way she would, consider it trash. Worst teacher I have ever had. In a nutshell, be perfect or flunk."
6112,2390578,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely the worst professor I've had so far. You can never get a hold of him. He refuses to be supportive or accommodating in any way. The assignments are nothing but boring slogs through PowerPoints hundreds of slides long ON TOP OF the assigned readings. Do not take this professor. I wish this class upon no one, not even my worst enemy. "
6113,2390578,1.0,4.0,"Took him for intro to philosophy. Expected a fair and objective discussion each week, but not a single week would go by where he would not inject his own personal philosophy into the lectures and assignments. Very Conservative and very Christian. Several of the assignments and required readings were borderline alt-right propoganda."
6114,1915460,5.0,2.0,"Overall this was an extremely laid back class, I got out early most days. Additionally Dr. Wiseman does an amazing job explaining how international business functions as a program at MSU. He frequently brought in guests from various business disciplines as well to help show the options available to us. Overall fun and amazing class."
6115,1915460,4.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Wiseman for International Economics. The only grades we had were two tests, a group presentation, and a group paper. The tests required a lot of writing and were graded pretty harshly (averages in the 70s), but all the info came straight from the PowerPoints and lectures. Lectures could be a little boring, but still an interesting class."
6116,1915460,2.0,3.0,Dr. Wiseman's class is a joke. Doesn't really teach anything during the class. His lectures are him just blabbering about stuff. Takes forever to grade anything.
6117,1915460,5.0,1.0,"Took Wiseman for Intro to International Business. Easiest class ever. We only had to read parts of a book and write a paragraph on it, other than that, an easy test over resources on campus and attend IB club meetings."
6118,1915460,4.5,2.0,"Such a cool professor always talking about his beer connoiseur-ness. He tends to drag out his classes but more often than not they are very interesting and he really does know what he is talking about. He gave a lot of bonus points, especially for attendance. No homework but weekly quizzes that are very helpful for exam preparation."
6119,932445,5.0,5.0,This is a hard class but Highfield is fair and organized. He curves the high grade on exams to 100 but only count on about 5 points. He sends a lot of emails in canvas. Often multiple emails per day which is annoying. Probably the most organized class I have had at MSU.
6120,932445,5.0,5.0,"Hard class. Prepare to do 2 assignments each week and watch a lot of video lectures. The lectures can be boring, but they cover the key idea, and he is sometimes funny. He has you ask questions online, and he responds very quickly. Exams are crazy hard, so study, study, study. If you don't watch the videos you are screwed. Good, but glad it's over."
6121,932445,5.0,3.0,"Mike Highfield recently received the T. Eugene Spragens, III President's Award for outstanding teaching presented by The Graduate School of Banking at LSU annually. I would highly recommend taking his class. "
6122,932445,5.0,5.0,"Just finished Finance 3123 with an A! Highfield's class was hard and a lot of work, but he lays out what you need to do. Just watch his videos (learned a lot) and complete the homework on time (you get two passes on each). Exams are really hard but fair if you are staying on top of the class. I would take him again but like others, I hate Honorlock"
6123,932445,4.0,3.0,"I don't know why people say Dr. Highfield is so hard. If you do the homework and take notes, you will be fine. You get two attempts on most homework and you get to drop your lowest homework grade and test grade. Overall, Dr. Highfield's class was organized and he responded really fast to questions. I learned some stuff."
6124,932445,5.0,3.0,"There are lots of videos to watch and there 2 homework assignments per week plus exam reviews. His videos covered the big picture and were easy to follow with notes. Course was organized, but I don't like Connect or Honorlock. He curves and gives drop grades. Overall, if you do the work that Highfield requires you can get an A or B easily. "
6125,932445,2.0,5.0,"He is a professor, maybe not a great one but he is one. His lectures have little or nothing to do with what is on the exams. He doesn't explain what is needed for the exams or what to study. His tests are all multiple choice and are of course some of the hardest questions you can be given. Do not recommend taking him as a professor there are better"
6126,932445,5.0,5.0,"I just finished Highfield's Mortgage Finance class. It was just an elective for me, but I had to work my @$$ off to get a B in his class and I am proud of that B. He takes his class seriously and his exams and excel assignments are some of the hardest I have had in the finance major. He curves exams and gives some bonus chances. Do the bonus!"
6127,932445,4.0,5.0,I am taking 3123 now and it is the hardest class I have taken since calculus. Dr. Highfield posts videos and they are as good as you could hope for in an online class. He tells lots of stories and is somewhat funny. His notes go with the lectures word-for-word. Some complain about the grades but they but watch the videos and you will be fine.
6128,932445,5.0,5.0,"I took Highfield for MBA Corporate Finance in Spring 2021. He said he was trying a new format for his class and it worked us really hard. I thought there were too many videos, but I learned a lot of Excel. To be honest, I learned more in this class than all my other MBA classes combined. Hard class but good professor."
6129,932445,5.0,5.0,"I took his class over the winter session and I feel like I got cheated out the best possible experience with him due to the online format. He really seems like an awesome professor, his class was just very difficult online. He went above and beyond to connect with students and answer their questions. Really great professor."
6130,932445,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Highfield loves MSU, his students, and finance. He truly believes that what he is teaching is important, and he wants you to learn it. His first exam was probably the hardest exam I have ever taken in undergraduate or the MBA. The second exam was easier, maybe because I studied more. I learned a ton in this class, and a lot about Excel."
6131,932445,5.0,4.0,"First and foremost, this is a man who truly wants his students to come away from his Finance MBA course with useful finance knowledge. You can hear the passion that he has just by listening to his voice when he speaks of topics in class. He is, without a doubt, the best lecturer I have ever had."
6132,932445,5.0,5.0,"Attend class and Study! Highfield is a good guy, he cares about the students, but he wants you to learn the material.  If you study, you can do fine. Be prepared to study more in this class than the rest of the MBA program combined! I completely bombed one of his exams, but I honestly learned more from Highfield than any other professor I have had."
6133,932445,5.0,5.0,"The comments below are absolutely true. Dr. Highfield knows his stuff, and he will kick your butt. His exams are some of the hardest exams I have ever taken. However, if you attend class and listen to him, you will walk out of the class a lot smarter than you did when you walked in. I am a graduating senior, and he is the best professor I have had."
6134,932445,4.5,5.0,"Dr. Highfield's class is the hardest class in the MBA program, but it is the one I learned the most in. I am used to getting A's, but I &quot;earned&quot; a B in his class, and I am proud of that B. Study more for the first test than you did on all of your first semester tests or you are screwed."
6135,932445,5.0,5.0,"I learned more from Dr. Highfield than I did in the rest of the entire MBA program. He is hard, but he is a lot of fun. I really think he cares about the students. Best class in the MBA program!"
6136,932445,4.5,5.0,"His tests are pretty hard, and the homework is a lot of work...but you can work together on it, so that helps a lot. He also curves the test grades too, so that helps as well. Hardly ever used the book, you won't need it. He is helpful and is pretty funny at times."
6137,932445,5.0,5.0,"One of the best professors I have ever had. He is not easy, and his homework takes forever, but I learned a lot in this class."
6138,1563239,5.0,2.0,"Ginny Rocks! Very helpful,easy to contact, makes class fun! Attendance is not mandatory, however I highly recommended it. I literally took Freshman Comp 3x BEFORE I had Ginny, and hated it so much I dropped the class 3x. Ginny was the first teacher to get me to enjoy writing, and get through freshman comp! I had to take her for CompII!"
6139,2636394,4.0,3.0,A sweet guy who really cares about students and making sure you comprehend the material covered.
6140,2013806,5.0,4.0,"4 tests for Behav Mod. Final is only to replace lowest. Armstrong really inspired me to take more Psych and Philosophy classes along with my major in Mechanical Engineering. His class requires note taking to do well on tests, but the tests mainly are reworded questions on the notes. I would take him for any class I could as it was such a fun class."
6141,2013806,4.0,3.0,"Makes class as interesting as he can but it can still be really boring some days. Leaves blanks in his PowerPoints so that you have to attend class to get all of the info. If you don't get the textbook, don't expect to pass the tests. However, he does drop grades, has interesting stories sometimes, and is really understanding."
6142,2013806,5.0,2.0,Really good man. Definitely my favorite professor. He really cares about his student's success.
6143,2013806,5.0,3.0,I had Dr. Armstrong for Behavior Modification. His class was amazing and I learned a lot. Tests are relatively difficult and you definitely need the textbook to understand the material.
6144,2013806,4.5,4.0,"I took him for Intro to Clinical Psych and loved it! We only had quizzes on the chapters, but what was most interesting were the assigned activities throughout the semester.  Make sure you attend class and read the textbook!!"
6145,621203,4.0,4.0,"great prof! she's so interested in what she's teaching, you can't help but enjoy it. the lab that goes along with the lecture isn't near as good though..."
6146,621203,3.0,4.0,"Tests aren't exactly fair. If she says the final is not comprehensive, do not believe her. The way this class is taught is absolute insanity, with a new teacher every couple of class periods, referenced an earlier edition of the text book that was completely different from the one you buy from the book store."
6147,621203,5.0,4.0,Wonderful teacher. She is very knowledgeable about the subjects being taught
6148,621203,4.5,5.0,"Great class and great teacher.  Didn't know what to expect from the start of class though and how hard the tests were.  Spelling is a must on the tests and so are mechanisms.  DO NOT SKIP THIS CLASS! The lab is also a pain for this class, but Dr. Yost and the TA's do a great job."
6149,621203,5.0,5.0,"Probably one of my favorite teachers ever, and HOT!"
6150,621203,5.0,4.0,Wonderful because she made us think and apply our knowledge rather than regurgitate information.
6151,621203,5.0,4.0,No Comments
6152,621203,1.5,4.0,Very hard and expects you to know what she knows. She ssumes you know specifics about certain topics. Doesn't consider that some people that take her class are not microbiology majors. You really need to take micro before you take this class.
6153,137877,3.0,3.0,"She's a decent teacher and her tests are not very hard. The only problem I ever had with her was her lack of technology usage. She wrote everything on the chalkboard, so her body covered her writing some of the time. She's also very old"
6154,137877,2.0,4.0,"Simply she doesn't explain things very well. It's kind of all over the place and not very specific. She's sweet and if you go to her outside of class her explanation is slightly better. Also there's a lot of homework and a couple of times the dates on these homeworks changed without much warning, so that's good to know."
6155,137877,3.0,3.0,"Mrs. Shaw is a nice lady but she is not very good at explaining the material. Her tests aren't too bad and are available on Koofers, and she gives you unlimited attempts on homework, but she isn't particularly generous with partial credit. However, if you are capable of self-teaching using the practice another version on WebAssign you will be ok."
6156,137877,2.0,4.0,"Mrs. Shaw does care about her students, but her teaching style is troublesome. She only uses chalkboard and does not post notes online, so if you miss a few days, you will struggle.  The tests aren't too bad, except barely any partial credit is given, which can hurt your grade. Don't even get me started on Mathematica."
6157,137877,3.0,3.0,Shaw is a fine teacher. Somewhat dull but her tests are usually the same as the study guide. Very reasonable as well
6158,137877,2.0,3.0,Koofers is the only reason I did okay in the class. Office hours are the only hours she will see you. She gives different test versions with completely different problems on them. Some tests the average was an B on one version and a D on the other. 
6159,137877,1.0,3.0,Not clear during lectures. Assigns homework on material she hasn't covered. Makes students feel stupid for asking questions. Worst teacher I've had.
6160,137877,3.0,3.0,"I think most people struggle in the class because they haven't had any of it in High School Calculus, and can't rely on prior knowledge. And it doesn't help that her lectures don't explain the material very well. Beware of the end of the course where she'll cram sequences and series in two weeks. She's tough and not always fair, but you'll live."
6161,137877,1.0,2.0,Mrs. Shaw was the worst teacher I have ever had. She was disorganized & hard to understand. She was unprepared for class & wouldn't answer questions. Avoid her at all costs.
6162,137877,2.0,4.0,"Lectures are rushed but extremely boring, taking her for a second time (unfortunately) the class is going much better. I have only been to class 4 times thus far and currently have an A. Just do all your WebAssign and study before tests and you'll be fine."
6163,137877,1.5,4.0,Tests are hard and she can go either way with partial credit.  She even admits to putting problems on the test that she didn't cover. Her class is extremely boring.  Study for tests at least a week in advance if you want to get higher than an 80.
6164,137877,2.0,2.0,Extremely difficult final exam
6165,137877,1.5,5.0,Hated Her class
6166,137877,3.0,3.0,"She is a nice older lady.  She makes a lot of mistakes on the board and it can be hard to stay interested in lecture, but her tests are like the homework and they are fair.  She grades easy."
6167,137877,4.0,3.0,She explained things simply and gave study guides. Homework was very similar to tests
6168,137877,1.0,3.0,she has got to be the worst teacher i have ever had.  She lost my test and it took her a month to grade it.  She can not mult. half of the time.  It takes her 3 or 4 times to write something on the board because she messes up so much.  DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!!
6169,137877,4.0,1.0,SHE WAS EASY
6170,137877,1.0,2.0,"She is an aweful teacher.. she makes lots of mistakes on the board and doesn't know how to teach. Very unhelpful and will not answer questions, expects you to read her mind, will not tell you about online homeworks."
6171,137877,3.5,2.0,pretty easy as long as you come to class and keep up.  grades the tests really easily.
6172,137877,2.5,4.0,"her tests didn't come from notes, book, or on line quizes and couldn't finish time allowed. expected us to already know how to do cal2. wouldn't take again, heard she was better in cal1, but 2 is insane."
6173,137877,4.0,3.0,she is really clumbsy and makes mistakes all the time.  if you study what she tells you to its a breeze.  oh and also bca is a **** in the class.
6174,137877,5.0,3.0,"Exams were very reasonable; the problems were exactly like the ones she worked in class (TAKE NOTES!). Online homework and announced quizzes on rules count all together as one exam grade; it is an easy 100. Also gives an extra point or two on your final average for good attendance. I've always been awful at math, but I did well in her class."
6175,137877,3.0,2.0,"Really scatterbrained, not organized very well, wouldn't take again."
6176,137877,4.5,3.0,Very willing to help
6177,1882778,3.5,2.0,I had her for Linear Algebra.  She isn't too bad.  You will have homework and quizzes. And then Tests are basically just like the quizzes.  Only thing I hated was there were a few mathematical projects which are a pain.  But other than that. If you do the homework you know the quizzes.  IF you know the quizzes. You know the tests :D
6178,1882778,1.5,4.0,"If I could take this class with another teacher I would. She has a strong Indian accent which makes her very hard to understand, and the book is not used at all."
6179,1129144,1.0,2.0,Class is really boring and dry. This class is really easy you do not really need to go more than 75% of the time. He will take points off for missing class but its so easy youll still get a B with bad attendance. Buy the book for the tests. Didnt like him much as a guy. Kind of arrogant.
6180,1129144,2.0,4.0,"3 Essays basically decide your grade. It is graded extremely hard, and he doesnt give any feedback as to what is being done wrong or how you could have improved on it. Class is lectured with a white board and is extremely boring. Do not take him."
6181,1129144,1.0,4.0,"Absolutely the worst. Half the class meetings are movies, which he starts in the middle of to save time, but doesn't give you ANY background info or ANY reason why this is relevant to the course. There are no dates in the syllabus, so it's nearly impossible to know what the class period will hold."
6182,1129144,2.0,3.0,"He does a textbook check... if you don't have it, you won't pass and it's $150 to rent used. He can be funny at times, but he's really a jerk. During the semester two people have walked out because he was so rude. He doesn't really seem to know what he's talking about and he'll make you stupid for even thinking about speaking. Good luck."
6183,1129144,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher I have ever had at Mississippi State university. He is rude to any who dont really understand the poorly taught material, pushes his views on everything onto students, which I thought wasn't allowed in a classroom setting, and I'm almost positive the man has anger issues. DO NOT ever take him. If it were up to me, he'd be fired"
6184,2767563,5.0,3.0,She is a great professor! I truly enjoyed her class. She is accessible outside of class. Her coursework was interesting and relevant to the times.
6185,2333400,5.0,3.0,"Mme King is a great teacher and person. Totally recommended for taking French with her, especially French I! She's very caring of her students, teaches well, and is generally accessible outside of class and responds to emails in decent timing."
6186,2333400,5.0,1.0,"Dr. King cares a lot about the student learning the lecture and is very sweet. She is a must to take for French. Going to class matters because she takes 2 grades based on participation and if you show up to class. Overall, it's a class that is easy and she is a great teacher."
6187,2333400,5.0,2.0,She was my best professor this semester. She is really funny and helpful. Would take again!
6188,2333400,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. King is fantastic. She is so so sweet and very very helpful. Attendance is important in this class like with any foreign language, but she makes the class fun and social. I would recommend her for someone who didn't have a background in French, she's very accessible outside of class and passionate about the material."
6189,2333400,5.0,3.0,She is so sweet and honestly one of my favorite teachers Ive ever had. I took French 1 with absolutely no background in french and passed with a 99. She tells you everything you need to know for tests and always emails back pretty quickly. You get points for each day you are in class and you learn important stuff everyday so you should go to class
6190,1850073,5.0,2.0,"Great guy, fresh out of grad school. Really a fantastic teacher. Tests are fair and come from homework/in-class example problems with a few things changed. I had him for Statics(Engineering mechanics 1). Really knows his stuff and how to teach well, and really accessible outside of class. I recommend taking this guy for anything he teaches."
6191,1956582,4.0,2.0,"I think Dr. Gray gets way too bad a wrap for her classes, and I really don't know why. Her class was easy yet enjoyable and I learned a lot. What more could you really want? Her lectures are perfectly fine, she's very lively, and she obviously has fun teaching. She's not even a harsh grader. There's nothing wrong with taking her if you have to."
6192,1956582,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Gray cares deeply about her students and the material she teaches. She is extremely helpful outside of the classroom and is willing to work with students. She expects students to interact in class, but she often takes up most of the time rambling or talking to herself. Her spoken and written German has many grammatical errors."
6193,1956582,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Gray is a good teacher that cares about her students, but she can have her off days. A lot happens in class, so it is important to go. You are not guaranteed an A, but she is very fair in her grading, so you always get the grade you deserve."
6194,1956582,1.0,5.0,Stay far away from the German department at Mississippi State! Every single professor is inept and rude. Will make you feel dumb and call you names....
6195,1956582,5.0,4.0,She works hard to make sure that her students actually learn German. She expects a lot of effort but you'll learn the language.
6196,1956582,1.0,4.0,Run don't walk!
6197,1956582,1.5,5.0,She expects way too much from her students. Homework online every single night on material that hasn't been covered in the course yet. This course pushed me away from continuing my education in German. 
6198,1817343,1.0,4.0,"Online class. Too liberal, in my opinion. Way too much work for the class level. Unless you're a politics major, don't take him."
6199,1817343,5.0,1.0,I really liked this class. Dr. Mellen is pretty cool. His online tests are vey easy.
6200,2824973,3.0,5.0,"Overall the class was basically doing examples of problems that would be on the homework/quiz over 2-3 sections, doing the homework, taking the quiz at the math domain, repeat which was pretty boring but I think it may be a departmental thing and I wish there was a bit of a way to spice it up. But if you do get to know her, shes super nice :)."
6201,1661716,4.0,1.0,He was a helpful teacher and his class was easy if you just did the assignments which are very few and far between. Best teacher and class i have taken as far as easiness. Made an A in the class.
6202,1661716,4.0,1.0,"Mr. Lasala was a great teacher to have.  He only has two tests, and if you make a grade you like on the first one, you dont have to take the second one because he will double the first.  He has one project and it is a collage that is really easy and he gives you a 100 for it if you do it, no matter what it looks like.  Final was very easy."
6203,2251549,1.0,5.0,Worst grader ever
6204,2251549,2.0,4.0,Clear guidelines for essays and fully explains everything well. Nice in person but an extremely hard grader. Expects a lot from all essays.
6205,2251549,1.0,4.0,she grades super hard. if it is not exactly why she is expecting she will count off big time. she does not negotiate grades and she gets an attitude when you try and correct or explain something to her.
6206,2251549,1.0,4.0,"She grades super hard, expects work to be prompt and on time, and doesnt go easy at all."
6207,2251549,4.0,4.0,"She is very clear about what she expects on the papers and if you fall short of that your grade will drop. She is very nice and gives really great feedback but grades a little hard. She gives extra credit for every paper. This is extremely important, do the extra credit it. Try not to miss much class there is often in class participation grades."
6208,2251549,3.0,3.0,"Koleva is okay. Buy the books listed because you will use those. I'm not the best writer but I got A's on all but one essay, I honestly think if you do the peer revisions, the required revision activities, and bonus revision activities and you should be fine. The one essay I didn't get an A on I forgot to do the revision activity. Attend class."
6209,2251549,2.0,5.0,"She is a really nice person but academically she is hard. She is an extreme paper grader. Does not give a lot of revision back. Do not recommend to take for your composition 1. She is soft-spoken which can make you sleepy. She posts a lot of things on mycourses that are detailed, so get ready to read every point."
6210,2251549,3.0,4.0,really really tough grader on essays
6211,2251549,2.0,3.0,hope you write good paper
6212,2251549,2.0,3.0,goodluck.
6213,2251549,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Koleva's class was an excellent introduction to academic composition. She always provides clear instructions for papers and gives detailed feedback on drafts to help you improve. She is also quick to assist students and one of the kindest professors I have had so far.
6214,1809185,5.0,2.0,"Best teacher I've ever had. Taking him again as soon as possible! He's so encouraging of ideas, while still really teaching the material. Learned a lot and had a great time doing so."
6215,1809185,5.0,1.0,"Gracjan is not only a great teacher but a cool dude. He has a passion for what he teaches, and this becomes apparent during the classes. Best teacher I have ever had, hands down. Thanks Gracjan!"
6216,2636579,5.0,1.0,"Kelly Barton is the best choice for Comp 1 at Mississippi State. She is very productive with her time, so you can get out of class early and handle your business. I would definitely recommend."
6217,2358054,4.0,3.0,Need to go to class to get notes. he gives really good lectures and makes sure the class understands the tough subjects and will take the time to go over things more than once. The class is kind of difficult if you don't study. from what I've heard he's one of the better teachers for this corse
6218,2636589,5.0,1.0,"Incredible prof. As good as it gets for an intro class that could easily be boring and difficult. Dr. Burch wants his students to not only succeed but also get pumped about a industrial engineering and gives an easy A. I missed this class as a freshman, but even as a sophomore I loved it and he was the main reason this class was awesome."
6219,2636589,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Burch is super fun to have as a teacher (at least at the undergraduate level). Just pay attention in lectures, and you will do super well."
6220,2636589,4.0,2.0,"Great professor! Genuinely cares about his students and their futures. Very engaging in class, and super funny."
6221,2636589,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Burch is the best teacher I've had in my life so far. Everything he taught was easy to understand. He's a pretty chill guy, too, so that helps."
6222,2636589,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Burch is one of the best at giving lectures because he knows and understands the material he is teaching. There are a lot of homework assignments in the intro class, but they are very simple. Also, Homework is worth 50% of your grade. Also, no final exam. Just a final HW assignment worth 10% of grade."
6223,2177849,5.0,2.0,"He might only grade by four test, but he makes it very clear the material to learn. He keeps you engaged within class throughout his lectures too."
6224,2177849,5.0,3.0,"Professor Pounds is a very good professor. He gives pretty good lectures, he cancels class A LOT, some classes speakers come in, and his tests are multiple choice. There's no homework, just strictly 4 tests. He does require the textbook and he goes over problems in class. I will say that he goes over slides pretty quickly sometimes, but take him."
6225,2636611,5.0,2.0,I love him so much! He ensured everyone understood the lecture and was very straightforward with his teachings.
6226,2636611,5.0,3.0,"Cagle was probably in my top three for best professors I've ever had. he was very clear on what he was teaching and how It would be used on the test. Gave a very helpful review for the final(departmental). lastly, if you have any questions about hw, you can %100 count on him to respond in 3 minutes tops."
6227,2636611,5.0,2.0,He teaches everything very clearly. If you can work through the notes and the test review you will be able to make A's on all the tests. He is a great teacher.
6228,2636611,5.0,2.0,The perfect teacher. Super nice and chill. Explains everything so clearly and gives the best notes possible. This class was an easy A but I also learned a lot and enjoyed it. You're seriously missing out if you take anyone else for statics.
6229,2636611,5.0,1.0,"Even if you try to fail, it's pretty hard to. Tons of extra credit by showing up to guest lectures and doing extra homework. All the homework and tests were online, so the extra credit wasn't even necessary."
6230,2636611,5.0,3.0,Aaron might be the best professor for engineering mechanics. He teaches and tests fairly. Your homework will always be harder than the test and he prepares you well for your finals.
6231,2636611,5.0,3.0,"Definitely the best Statics professor at MSU. He works for the DOT, so he knows the content and can explain it in the simplest terms without relying on textbook methods and definitions. Gives good partial credit and very helpful test reviews. Highly recommend."
6232,2636611,5.0,2.0,"Gives as much partial credit on tests as possible, good teacher, gives clear notes and review before test. Would recommend him for statics."
6233,2636611,5.0,2.0,"The Cagmaster is probably the greatest Statics/Engineering Mechanics professor at MSU. He is a civil engineer for MDOT full-time. This is just his side gig, and he only teaches the one class. He reinforces/reteaches many Physics 1 topics that our awful physics department did not teach well. Provides a similar review before exams, very fair grader."
6234,2636611,5.0,1.0,He is the best.
6235,2333511,5.0,2.0,Mr. McKay is a great professor! He was very good at using examples to make the material easy to understand. Just pay attention in class and it is an easy A.
6236,2333511,5.0,2.0,Mckay is a fantastic professor that makes you really enjoy coming to class. He makes the subject very interesting and the homework is easy and at times even fun. I learned a great deal in this class and wish I could take him again!
6237,2333511,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Mckay is the bomb! Although his lectures are very long, he makes them fun. We had a free online textbook, and he should tell you about that the first day of class. youre going to have to read the book and notes in order to do good on the exams. Attendance is require and is a grade:) Ended with an A in his class"
6238,2333511,5.0,1.0,Hes really into what he teaches. Posts slides. Easy tests.
6239,2333511,4.0,4.0,Very well informed class. Mckay made the class interesting and simple. if you understand the slides you will have no problem passing the class.
6240,2333511,5.0,4.0,"Enjoyed this class, would recommend"
6241,2333511,5.0,4.0,"Incredible class. First year professor that is not only incredibly good looking, but cares about his students and really wants them to succeed. Would recommend to anyone needing psych."
6242,2743125,5.0,1.0,"This is honestly the sweetest professor I have had at Mississippi State so far. She provides the perfect material to study for tests and quizzes and I never received lower than a 92% on a test because of this. She offers extra credit often and posts every lecture online. I skipped a fair amount of classes, honestly, and always managed to do well."
6243,2292566,4.0,2.0,gives a lot of pop quizzes but they're easy as long as you read the chapter before class. tests are easy and she's very nice! gives a few drop grades too
6244,2292566,1.0,5.0,"She gives incorrect material on the lecture slides, so READ THE TEXTBOOK. The homework isn't long but the questions are very vague. Her test are are hard and you have to study hard to make a good grade. Attendance is completely mandatory. She gives random pop quizzes to make sure you're reading the chapters. Also, she broke the projector like 50x??"
6245,1342309,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Shanahan was a great teacher. We did do a group project, and there were not many assignments. He also takes a while to give grades back, but overall I would take him again. "
6246,1342309,5.0,3.0,"He is a great professor. He truly cares about his students. If you put in the effort, you will succeed!"
6247,1342309,5.0,4.0,"Probably the best professor I have ever had a class with at Ms State. Super good with communicating expectations, will answer emails at 1 am if important enough, he also helped me with an issue that I was having within my group for the semester project. Overall 10/10, great professor."
6248,1342309,5.0,3.0,Not accessible outside of class at all and messes up grading. Teaches through videos of other teachers.
6249,1342309,4.0,4.0,"Great professor who engages with the class and offers great feedback. Quite a bit of writing and research in the class, but Doc is a pretty lenient grader. Great class though - learn alot in a short amount of time."
6250,1342309,4.0,3.0,"I took the online class. There was discussion boards to work on daily and cases to give your opinions on. Also, we had a couple group papers. Enjoyed the class."
6251,1342309,4.0,2.0,"Solid choice, As long as you put in the work on the group projects, you will do fine in this class."
6252,1342309,1.0,4.0,This course had the potential to be fantastic.  The class project is actually interesting however Dr. Shanahan provided little to no pertinent guidance on the project.  The same can be said for the quizzes and tests which were very difficult. He knows the material but his style did not work for this class. The class had little to no oganizanization
6253,1342309,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Shanahan did not provide a single ounce of feedback throughout the entire course.   I did not receive a single grade until I got my final one, which was an A.   He also promised to review our projects if we turned them in early and give the groups feedback.  He instead provided canned feedback to the entire class that was not helpful at all."
6254,138087,2.0,1.0,"Lectures are very boring and he will give a quiz about everyday. Also, he focuses more on theoretical and not the practical side of things. BUT if you show up and put in the effort to get things done, the class is an easy A. Probably one of my least favorite classes but also one of the easiest"
6255,138087,2.0,5.0,He is terrible.
6256,138087,4.0,2.0,Do what he ask and you'll do fine.
6257,138087,4.5,1.0,"Good teach, helpful as long as you go ask him. Work hard and you'll do fine."
6258,138087,2.5,4.0,No Comments
6259,138087,2.0,4.0,No Comments
6260,1342312,3.0,4.0,"Class wasnt easy, but as long as you prepared and studied and paid attention youd be fine. He does have one of those voices that it is easy to doze off or not pay attention. It is just a lot of sitting there while he talks and underlines words on a powerpoint."
6261,1342312,3.0,4.0,"Principles of Managerial Accounting, like financial, is just a hard class. Dr. Addy is extremely lecture heavy, but all the information is important to the tests. This is just one of those classes that you have to work extremely hard in. However he does have TAs and is accessible outside of class. Also, read the book!"
6262,1342312,3.0,5.0,This is just a tough class. Hes really nice and good at answering questions in his office hours. In class hes great but can ramble and be hard to follow. If you can focus hes good!
6263,1342312,5.0,4.0,Professor Addy is a great professor. He offers office hours every week day to meet with him to go over any problems you might have. He even went over my test with me after I did not do as well as expected. He is an easy grader and will go the extra mile for you to do well.
6264,1342312,4.0,4.0,This was a difficult class but Dr. Addy was consistently available to help. He took so much of his time sitting one-on-one with me or with other students to help us understand. Did reviews before the test that helped immensely.
6265,1342312,4.0,3.0,Dr. Addy was a super understanding teacher. He gave lots of good information for the tests and homework was able to be submitted however many times to achieve the grade you want. You have to work for your grade but overall he is not a hard grader and works with you.
6266,1342312,4.0,4.0,"I was worried about this class but I found it to not be so bad. It's hard work to pass, especially for the exams. But the other assignments are graded with a lenient hand. You will not pass if you don't put work in. However, Dr. Addy was always EXTREMELY responsive to questions and was always able to meet outside of class, which helps immensely."
6267,1342312,4.0,2.0,"I think he was a great, caring professor. He would always available to call if I needed help. He would respond to my emails within typically 30 minutes if I sent it at a reasonable time. Fastest responder I have had at MSU in my opinion. As long as you do the work and his study guides, you will make an easy A. He really does care for the students."
6268,1342312,1.0,4.0,"He knows a lot about accounting but is terrible at teaching, and is impossible to reach outside of the classroom. Hes one of the worst professors Ive had for accounting and is sadly the only one offered for intermediate two."
6269,1342312,3.0,3.0,"Tests have a few questions we didn't talk about in class. A few projects (not group work), a manageable amount of homework, and daily attendance is mandatory."
6270,1342312,3.0,4.0,"Not too bad if you put in the work. LOTS of work. If you try hard, you can make an A."
6271,1342312,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Addy is a really nice person, but he is a horrible accounting teacher. I put at least 30 to 40 hours of preparation into each exam (not including homework) and I am struggled to keep a C. Up until this point I have had a 4.0 in my accounting course work. The worst part is that his tests are NOTHING like the material we have to work with."
6272,1342312,2.5,5.0,"Two credit class, at least 15 hours per week, many times 20 were required to keep up.  Insane amount of course work.  Lacked clarity, tended to bounce around, but was passionate about the subject and very responsivehelpful.  "
6273,1342312,1.5,5.0,tests were really hard and he did not explain the material well
6274,1342312,2.0,5.0,"He puts too much material on one test, and he does not list test taking time on class schedule."
6275,1342312,2.5,5.0,"Entirely too much work assigned with very little instruction. His TWO credit hour class required more time than the other NINE hours I was taking...combined. He is a nice guy and willing to help, but unless you are already proficient in accounting you will be in for some frustrating times ahead of you."
6276,2481001,5.0,1.0,"I loved this class. You can use notes and the book for the tests. I made all A's on my tests. You can find the HW online. If you miss this class, then you're basically missing test answers. This class is at 8 A.M., so you'll need to be discipline to get up in time. He writes on the board, meaning he doesn't upload notes."
6277,2063219,2.0,5.0,"Professor King is very accessible outside of the classroom and overall a pretty cool person. However, she is one of the worse teachers I have ever had. Textbook required homework that took days and required essay answers. She is not fit to teach as she is so busy and has too much on her plate. Provides extra credit that saves her and her students."
6278,1334140,3.5,4.0,The material isn't hard but there's a lot of it and test questions are on the extreme details. It may be a 1000 level course but it isn't taught like one. And she's at Auburn  University now.
6279,1334140,2.0,5.0,"This professor teaches this intro level class as if the students were already in vet school. I studied anywhere from 10-20 hours per week to receive a 79.6 that was not rounded. If you have a death in the family, a doctor's appointment or anything on a quiz, test, or lab day you might as well forget about missing class."
6280,1334140,4.0,3.0,"She is very considerate of her students and learns everyone by name.  Attendance is graded so it is important for you to go to class.  She likes to use clickers for questions, but they aren't used for a grade.  All of her notes are posted online, but she does tend to add some things to them while she lectures which could end up on the exams."
6281,1334144,2.0,2.0,Generally acceptable but ability to convey advanced course material is mediocre.
6282,1334144,5.0,3.0,Smart sharp and humorous
6283,1334144,2.5,3.0,"He has no patience and can get snappy. You think his tests or quizes are unfair&#63; Well there is no chance in having them changed. He gives homework, but not too much, but make sure you stay on top of it. However the homework is very different from the quizes. And the quizes are VERY different from the tests. And make sure you take detailed notes!"
6284,1334144,3.5,3.0,"All of the notes are posted online, but his lectures are really entertaining.  He uses everyday examples to explain things from an economic standpoint.  His examples are usually really funny and he makes economics easy to understand. He is always willing to help with homework.  He does give weekly quizzes and homework assignments."
6285,2677635,4.0,2.0,"This instructor was amazing. You could tell that she really wanted her students to do well and made great efforts to show that. She is a very lenient grader and balances the weight of the tests, homework, and final very well. If you are taking Engineering Mech 1, I highly recommend this instructor."
6286,2800516,5.0,3.0,"I took Graph Theory with him. He made sure that we understand the works, assignments and lectures. Tests are fairly easy as you would understand everything he teaches. This is one of the type of class where you would wanna go to the lectures. Absolutely loved my time being in that class. "
6287,1334149,5.0,2.0,Professor Doughty is a GREAT professor. She's one of the best English teachers I've ever had. She gives great feedback! She also allows you to turn in late work but it will be DEDUCTED! Overall her class is definitely an easy A.
6288,1334149,4.0,3.0,Mrs. Doughty was very caring and genuinely concerned about her students understanding the material. She gave A LOT of homework. Be prepared to have something due every class meeting. The homework is helpful though and easy grades. We worked a lot out of the book.
6289,1334149,4.0,4.0,"She was funny and always fair. However, she does give lots of homework. But she gives helpful feedback. if you do your work, shes pretty cool."
6290,1334149,1.0,5.0,"Rarely gave feedback on papers past sending links and telling to &quot;TEST&quot; paragraphs. Unclear grading criteria for papers, rubrics were vague compared to what she wanted. I was sick from class once and was told I was not able to make up homework, despite having a university excused absence."
6291,1334149,2.0,5.0,"This was the worst class I've ever taken. Granted, it was Accelerated Comp 2, but it was unreasonably hard. There was something (that took at least 30 minutes-2 hours to do) every single class. She is very willing to meet outside of class and gives a small amount of extra credit. You must must must go to class. Very subjective grader in my opinion."
6292,1334149,4.5,1.0,"Mrs. Doughty assigns a lot of reading with homework for the first two papers. None of it is hard, but you will not pass if you don't do it. She is very precise about what she is looking for and makes it clear what she expects for your paper. She is also very willing to help you outside of class and gives bonus opportunities for the last two papers."
6293,1334149,2.5,3.0,She is hard and really annoying. Be prepared to write two papers. All her stuff is online but the test are really tricky. Take them in a group!! She is really annoying but she is the only one to offer teaching grammar. You just have to suffer through. 
6294,1334149,5.0,2.0,"She is very available and wants to help you as much as she can. For the most part she's an easy grader. There are a couple of quizzes, but she warns you ahead of time. She's really nice and funny!"
6295,1334149,4.0,4.0,She is nice and open to talking about your paper(s) anytime during office hours or appointments. She seemed to grade really erratically (she wouldn't count off for something on one paper but would on the next) and didn't give great feedback. Never got a grade on the final paper. Expect to have to bring homework to almost every class and read a lot.
6296,1334149,4.5,1.0,"This class is incredibly easy but there is a lot of busy work. You are required to read chapters about different writing styles and it tends to get boring. All the reading is reviewed in great detail in class, and she makes sure everyone clearly understands everything. She is very helpful and is more than willing to help with anything you may need."
6297,400289,1.0,2.0,"I did not enjoy his class at all. In fact, I'm not even sure that he knows what he's talking about. Everything comes straight out of the textbook, so just read the text book and you'll be fine. Lectures are boring and he is not helpful AT ALL during office visits."
6298,400289,4.0,3.0,"Very good online lecturer! I wish I could take more classes with him.  Prior to MET II, I knew very little about meteorology. Now I wish I had majored in meteorology the first time around in school........."
6299,400289,2.0,4.0,"Exams were terribly written and were a huge problem.  Typos and vague questions were were the highlight of each exam. Most of the time I felt I had to read his mind and guess which watered down answer he was looking for on the exam. Exams are worth a total of 60% of the grade. This class had potential, however, failed to meet my expectations."
6300,400289,4.5,3.0,"A great teacher. He moves a bit fast sometimes, but all of the notes are online. His door is always open, and he's always willing to help."
6301,400289,5.0,4.0,"Just took an application exam for radar.  This class was great, I just realized how much I learned.  Dr. Brown is a sly teacher, giving you stuff he knows you will need without letting you know you will need it."
6302,400289,5.0,4.0,Just started the class but Brown is the best prof at MSU!  This guy loves what he does and it makes me excited about my major.  Can't wait until we get to the really juicy stuff (tornadoes).
6303,400289,5.0,3.0,"Loved the class.  Radar portion is better than satellite portion, but severe weather is cool.  Brown loves what he does and it shows.  I got a B in the class and worked hard for it.  Great Professor!"
6304,400289,5.0,4.0,Best class in the meteorology program.  The information is great and you can tell that Mike loves what he does.  FANTASTIC CLASS!!
6305,400289,5.0,4.0,Great Teaching Style.  Dr. Brown has passion for his work and it shows.  He moves fast but the information is much needed.
6306,400289,4.5,2.0,Great teacher w/ a passion for severe wx.  One of the best.
6307,400289,5.0,4.0,Great professor!  The best in the meteorology program!
6308,400289,5.0,4.0,Great teacher!  Please teach all of my meteorology courses.  Dr. Brown challenges the students and gives fair tests.  Great class
6309,400289,5.0,4.0,No Comments
6310,400289,5.0,4.0,"Fun class.  Make sure you don't miss his class as the exams are difficult.  Mike is fair when it comes to grading, something other professors could learn from.  I'm glad he is at MSU!"
6311,400289,5.0,4.0,Great guy with a real understanding of what is important.  Classes can move fast so come with plenty of lead in the pencil.  Pay attention and you will learn a lot.
6312,400289,5.0,4.0,Good class - professor knows his stuff and finds a good middle ground with his teaching.  This guy loves the weather and it shows.
6313,400289,5.0,3.0,Great teacher - Exams are difficult but very fair
6314,400289,4.5,2.0,"fun professor, knows his stuff and is passionate about weather. I really enjoyed the class,  Great professor!"
6315,900003,4.0,1.0,"I took Dr. Fabel for MA 4173 Number Theory. Dr. Fabel's lectures, while usually entertaining and informative, do tend to wander from topic to topic. If you have a hard time paying attention in class Dr. Fabel may not be the best pick. The homework and exams are very easy, and are graded very generously. I got an A without trying particularly hard."
6316,900003,1.0,4.0,"Worst professor I have ever taken. He told us he &quot;does not believe in grades&quot; and so we only had a midterm and a final. HOWEVER, the midterm simply said &quot;submit some notes and i will grade you based on how i feel your effort was&quot; and the final was verbal in which he would not even allow you to write anything down to help with clarification."
6317,900003,5.0,3.0,Amazing guy. First professor I've had at State that made the content interesting. Had him for Cal 4 and he actually explained how you could use the math in real life. Very understanding when it comes to grading. You should definitely take him.
6318,900003,5.0,2.0,Easy and interesting
6319,900003,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Fabel is.. interesting, to say the least. Hes an absolute genius in the math field, but seems unable to effectively convey his knowledge to students. He bounces off the walls, frequently gets off topic, and says things that are of no relevance to the course. HOWEVER, if you can follow his wacky teaching style, the course isnt too hard."
6320,900003,4.0,3.0,"Really nice, but totally crazy!! ... but his oddness makes for a great class. Great teacher! But if you're horrible at math or slightly bad... stay away. You need to be smart to be in his class. Works your brain!! He really challenges you."
6321,900003,2.0,2.0,Loses himself in teaching
6322,900003,4.5,2.0,Absolutely Great teacher. Very helpful and explains in great detail. He makes comparisons to things that you can actually understand and comprehend. Very energetic about his class and the material and likes to make things fun. Very descriptive but uses his own examples but they translate directly to the book. Highly recommended
6323,900003,4.5,2.0,"Dude is hilarious, and knows his stuff.   Best math teacher   I've had at State.  If you do the homework, you'll do good on the tests."
6324,900007,4.0,3.0,"The projects were a lot of work, but his grader didn't count off much for errors.  Also he would give a list of what could be on the test and it never varied from that."
6325,900007,3.5,5.0,"He's fair, but unbelievably hard.   You better study like you've never studied before."
6326,1612718,4.0,4.0,"Get ready to work! This class is extremely difficult, but as long as you do the homework and labs in a timely manner, and study said homework and labs, then you will do well on the tests. I found her power point chapters to be too much to absorb. But, she's very accessible and very fair. Word from the wise: do not take during the 4 week semester."
6327,1612718,4.0,4.0,Dr. Doffitt is a tough teacher but she needs to be since this is a core required class and important stuff to know if you want to be in the medical field!  I would not recommend taking this class for the one month semester in the summer.  Do ALL the homework and modules (a lot is extra credit) and study and you will be fine in this class.
6328,1612718,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Doffitt is great. Although I took an online class, she was easily accessible. I had to ask for help with some technical problems and timing issues. She was very understanding. I suggest you read the material well and use any tools that she gives you such as videos and learning activities. The tests are difficult. The teacher is fair."
6329,1612718,4.5,2.0,"She covered the information very quickly, but thoroughly. You could bring the text book and highlight she followed it that well. The best thing about her, though, was she told you exactly how to study and do well. As a freshman that can be helpful because it's such a new environment. She really helped me!"
6330,1612718,4.0,4.0,She often talks of certain processes and subjects a little off course. She adds things that were relevant after she is done talking about that section. I recommend studying because the tests are very difficult and you will fail if you don't study! Plus it helps understand what she lectures in class!
6331,1612718,3.5,4.0,Could have been better. I studied my butt off for an A.
6332,1612718,3.0,4.0,Very tough teacher that does not put notes online. Very intelligent and tests are hard. Attendance is mandatory and she also awards bonus points for coming. Final is optional.
6333,1612718,4.5,4.0,"Good, fair, but tough. Must study."
6334,1612718,5.0,3.0,"Her tests were sometimes worded so you wouldn't know what she was talking about and questions on the test sometimes wasn't covered in class. She does gives you methods of studying and is willing to answer any question you have. Doesn't post notes online, must attend class."
6335,1612718,4.0,2.0,Her class is strictly lecture. We only take a few tests and that compiles your grade. She explains concepts well and in detail. Doffitt also gives good studying advice for her tests. As long as you study a few hours and have a good understanding of the material you should do great. All her questions come from her notes. Just study from those.
6336,1735599,4.5,3.0,He is a very nice professor and I learned so much about Earth Science that I can now watch NatGeo and follow the program with interest.
6337,1735599,4.0,2.0,"He is a great teacher! He was very helpful and made classes very interesting. He puts all powerpoints and study guides online. The tests were mostly short anwer, but sometimes those are the best because you atleast recieve partial credit. We had some quizzes in the class and most questions on the quiz were on the test. Take him if you can!!"
6338,2636727,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Nolen is such a good professor. Her passion for social work is very clear and makes me more excited about social work. There aren't a lot of assignments so make sure to turn everything in and try on everything but the assignments are not difficult. Love her class!!

6339,2636727,5.0,2.0,Always helpful and lectures were interesting 
6340,2563001,5.0,3.0,Ms. Morgan (now Ms. Gill) was very helpful throughout the entire course. There were lots of papers but she always provided good feedback and allowed 2 drafts per paper. She was very accessible outside of class and responded quickly to emails.
6341,2563001,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Morgan is wonderful! She is super sweet, encouraging, and very helpful. EN 1113 is a lot of writing but she gives good feedback and guidance for success. Most assignments are turned in during class so it makes attendance more mandatory, but she'll also let class out early if she sees significant progress is made. 100% the best :)"
6342,1629131,5.0,3.0,Great overall
6343,1629131,2.5,3.0,"Teacher tried to help when needed but was not always clear.  There was a definite language barrier.  Tests looked exactly like the homework and textbook studies.  ALWAYS read the textbook!  Overall, a really nice teacher."
6344,1743820,1.0,4.0,"Peter knows exactly what he wants, but he does not make it clear to you. If you do not have everything needed for class, he will call you out in front of the entire class and humiliate you.  If at all possible, avoid taking him for Type."
6345,1686496,4.0,4.0,Dr. Ervin is a wonderful instructor but very strict. You really have to work hard for each grade you receive. Living with Global Change is a great Biology elective time take but it is only offered during the spring.
6346,2718702,5.0,3.0,Matthew Dean is the best professor I had over my first semester. He really cares about his students and asks for their opinions on how grades are weighted and what kind of assignments he we want to do. 10/10
6347,2718702,5.0,3.0,He is a great teacher. He really likes to get to know the students so he will most likely know your name by the end of the semester. His slides are short usually only up to 14 max and we are done with class about 10 minutes early every day. I highly suggest taking his class if you have the option.
6348,2546671,1.0,3.0,Shah is quite possibly the worst professor I have had in all my years of going to school. Graduate student who clearly had no idea how to teach and was constantly asked to change his ways and never did. SI did nothing for anyone. All test averages were below 60s. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
6349,2546671,1.0,5.0,This class was horrible. The instructor was a graduate student who never showed he could work any problems from scratch. Read from the lecture slides everyday even after asking him on several occasions to change the way he did lecture. Even attending SI will didn't help with his poor teaching skills. Very unprepared for the departmental final.
6350,1735689,5.0,1.0,"Very good teacher, he works with you if you do not understand the material you are going over.  Gives you the option to either do all your work at your own pace.  Interesting class.  Would highly recommend."
6351,1735689,4.0,2.0,"By far the most interesting teacher I have ever had. There are many moments when you are not sure if you should laugh. Everything you need to succeed in this class will be taught to you and reviewed. Make your best effort at every assignment given, even if you have no clue what to do, it can only benefit you."
6352,1735689,4.0,2.0,"Good Professor.  If you go to class you will understand everything and it will be simple.  He provides extra credit opportunities i suggest taking advantage of them.  He tends to make some corny jokes, but hey, it actually keeps you listening. He's an interesting person."
6353,1735689,5.0,1.0,if you go to class and get the notes you'll be fine. he makes the class interesting and funny! highly recommended
6354,1735689,4.0,2.0,"Fun guy works lots of problems knows and knows his stuff. Gives extra credit. Knows more about math and science and ""REAL"" applications gota be there to kknow what i mean.  Doesnt explain why things work but if you talk 2 hiim after class he'll show you so much no time for in class"
6355,2169876,1.0,5.0,The WORST professor I've had here. Very tough grader on essays. Gave a girl in my class a 0 on an essay she turned in. He told me my rough draft was good and ended up going me a 66 on my paper. He is very boring and doesn't make the class interesting. Comp 2 should have been an easy class and he made it very hard for everyone. Avoid him if can!!
6356,2169876,4.0,3.0,"Lots of papers, but it is a comp class after all. He was fair, and answered questions if you bothered to ask. Good class I if you are not a slacker and care to learn."
6357,2169876,1.0,5.0,"AWFUL PROFESSOR. he gave me zeros on my rough drafts because they ""looked too much like my final draft"".  his lectures were so boring I would fall asleep and he got mad when someone had their phone out. also for the final, I didn't space my 250 word HANDWRITTEN essay correctly and he made me redo it. awful awful awful"
6358,2169876,1.0,5.0,Let's just say Jeff is the worst thing about freshman year.  He is a very tough grader who doesn't tell you at all what he wants in your essay.  His lectures are pointless and don't help you with anything on your essays.  Most importantly if your view on a topic is different than his he will give you a grade that reflects that.
6359,2169876,1.0,5.0,He is the worst teacher you can have. All he does is assign homework and papers and doesn't even teach the material.
6360,2530341,5.0,1.0,Best professor ever! Super understanding and very nice!! His class is pretty easy and he makes it so fun!!!
6361,2530341,5.0,3.0,He is a great teacher
6362,1432614,5.0,2.0,"Professor Evans' class was a very good class to take in tandem with Gen Psych. His tests and quizzes were easy, his lectures demanded engagement but were beyond interesting, and he keeps work to a minimum. Cannot recommend him enough."
6363,1432614,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Evans is the best! He's hilarious and his enthusiasm about trees will make you love them too. However, lectures can become monotonous, and a lot of material is covered. The tests are mainly memorization and hard at all if you study in advance.  The lab is hard at first, but gets easier with time, so don't freak out about the first few quizzes."
6364,1432614,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Evans is a highly enthusiastic teacher, and he can be funny and entertaining. The tests are large and cover lots of material which can be difficult, but the class itself is good. I would definitely recommend taking this professor."
6365,1432614,5.0,3.0,Mr. Evans was a GREAT professor. He was funny and very easy to talk to. His tests are very hard though. You have to participate and show up because it will help your grade out. It isn't hard to participate his lectures are a lot of discussion. He was my favorite Professor this semester just take him seriously and NO PHONES.
6366,1432614,2.5,4.0,"Prof. Evans is very knowledgeable and professional, but if you want laid-back, he's not the instructor you want teaching a course.  He's fair and explicit, so if you don't do something right he will not offer much sympathy.  Tends to give the vibe that you are wasting his time if you are not careful with how you approach him."
6367,2063420,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Webb PSY 4353 (Psychology and the Law) and he was GREAT!  He kept the lectures interesting (never boring and dull) and assigned assignments that grab your attention.  Never any ""busy work.""  If you study, you'll definitely pass.  Def take Dr. Webb if you can!!!!!"
6368,2063420,4.0,2.0,"I LOVE HIM. Literally take him if you have to take psychology. I don't know how much longer he will be around, though. He is super funny and personable. His class is super easy and he gives study guides for every test that REALLY help. Plus, he offeres LOTS of extra credit and posts the notes online. "
6369,1907784,5.0,1.0,"Amazing professor 
"
6370,1907784,5.0,2.0,she is a great teacher for communication. I loved her. she was very reachable outside of her office and was willing to help me. she grades very fair on speech and there is a lot of homework but it will help your grade in the long run
6371,1907784,5.0,4.0,Mrs. Knight is a fantastic teacher. I took her Intro to Comm course. You must attend class to receive notes. The tests are straight from lecture/notes. She realizes people are scared to give speeches and creates a good environment for the class. I would highly recommend her and take more classes with her.
6372,1907784,5.0,3.0,"She keeps the class very interesting. To get an A, you will have to study for it. Project, group activity, and participation are fun. And she is hot!!!"
6373,1408080,4.5,2.0,"She was very into history and knew what she was talking about, made the class fun to attend. The test were all essays and paragraphs and if you know the 5 W's Who, What, When, Where, and Why about your topic you will do fine in the class. I would recommend her to anyone"
6374,1408080,4.0,3.0,I took this class expecting it to be a easy A we'll it isn't . You have to attend class to copy notes from her lecture and she talks really fast and you sometimes can't here her. Her test are by far the hardest test at  state because it's a blank sheet of paper . You have 50minutes to write multiple paragraphs . I ended up with an A ! STUDY !
6375,1408080,5.0,2.0,"Nice, Friendly, interesting, go to class, study, and you will get an A."
6376,1408080,5.0,2.0,"She was the TA for my class, but the discussion sections she led once a week made the class as a whole a lot more interesting and enjoyable. She's very enthusiastic about her subject and interested in helping others see it as dynamic and worth studying - and that's the only sort of teacher worth taking a class from in my opinion."
6377,2587732,5.0,2.0,She is the sweetest woman and will always be there to help you if you need it. she really came through and helped when my advisor did not help me. so thankful for her and her class
6378,2587732,5.0,1.0,"I loved my honors forum class. Only assignments were very short 1 page writing assignments which were all based around the top of personality types. The final was a 2 page paper with a similar topic. When lectures weren't about personality types, she borough in guest speakers (not exciting speakers but at lease we didn't have to do tedious work)."
6379,2186336,1.0,3.0,RUN!
6380,2186336,2.0,4.0,"Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss. Her tests were very difficult and she had to curve them by like 30-40 points. She told us we would get open note/two attempts/and a drop test to improve our grades. She then tells us she never said anything about a drop test grade. Tests=HARD and textbook based after telling us to not get it if we couldn't afford it."
6381,2186336,3.0,4.0,"She is clearly passionate about what she does and wants her students to succeed; however, she cannot lecture. She would often go on tangents that take 15-20 minutes out of every class. Then because of her random stories, we would often be held over trying to finish slides. Maybe some people would enjoy this, but my ADHD can't handle it."
6382,2186336,3.0,4.0,"Lectures are boring and the study guides don't help on tests. However, she usually lets class out early and sometimes gives extra credit just for showing up. Attendance doesn't affect your grade and she curves tests by a lot."
6383,2186336,1.0,4.0,I took this class for credit but I could have taken any other class. She made me regret even thinking about signing up for this class. Exams are impossible she is a dull lecturer and to top it all off ironically the psych of learning professor doesn't understand how her students learn.
6384,2186336,2.0,5.0,She gives study guides that are at least five pages long. Exams are 60% of your grade. If you are not a great test taker DO NOT TAKE!!!!!!
6385,2186336,1.0,4.0,"The worst part about this class is you have no idea what to study. Test and quiz material comes out of NOWHERE, lectures are difficult to follow as if they are just copied and pasted with no forethought or structure. Study guides don't help, my notes didn't help. She's difficult to get in touch with and cancels class at the LAST minute."
6386,2186336,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! I have her for psy of learning and she is awful. Lectures are really boring and she gets off topic really easily. She cancels class 5 min before it starts. Tests are extremely difficult, half of the stuff that are on the exams she doesn't teach. She does give study guides, they do not help. Be prepared to teach yourself."
6387,2186336,2.0,4.0,"Very helpful to have lectures, but she gets side-tracked consistently to the point you forget what we were discussing in the first place. It makes it hard to learn the material from these videos when she's constantly doing that and not making it interesting. Better off reading the text book."
6388,2186336,5.0,2.0,"Definitely take Mrs. Hubbard if you have the chance. She does tend to get a little side tracked, but sometimes her stories make you remember the material. She cancels class sometimes and gives extra credit on random days. Her tests are exactly like the study guides she posts on canvas."
6389,2186336,1.0,3.0,"Not easy to contact, test questions come from no where, absolutely no where. never mentioned in class, not in the lectures, I have absolutely no clue. Sometimes interesting but gets off topic so much."
6390,2186336,5.0,2.0,"Professor Hubbard was great! There were a few assignments I missed along the way, she allowed me to make them up. She provides lectures and external links to assist with learning. Expect weekly discussions, quizzes, occasional 1 page summaries and of course tests. GREAT teacher, very kind. TAKE HER if you can."
6391,2186336,5.0,3.0,She is the best! She gives a lot of extra credit in class so go to class. She gives the exam as a study guide word for word. If you don't pass her class with an A it's simply because you did not try. Ms. Hubbard makes the class interesting by telling stories that relate to the topic we are discussing and lets us state our opinions on some topics
6392,2186336,4.0,3.0,"This professor goes by the presentation in lectures and uploads the lectures of the unit right after a test is taken on the previous unit, which helps if you have to miss class. She gives great examples in-class that are not in presentations. The only homework is 3 question quizzes after each class and 6 credits of psychology research."
6393,2186336,4.0,3.0,She is really good at making sure you know the material and she makes the lectures interesting and may get sidetracked at times but it is still mostly relevant to the subject. All you need for the quizzes are the notes which are uploaded on mycourses and the tests aren't hard just make sure to study!
6394,2186336,4.0,1.0,really liked her! she was funny and really nice! she cancelled class some and let us out early! she gave us a study guide which had everything we need to know on all 4 tests! she great!
6395,2186336,4.0,1.0,"She is the BEST teacher. Do not even think of taking someone else other than her. She gives a study guide for every exam and its EXACTLY like the exam. Word for word. She gives lots of extra credit, lets out class early sometimes, and keeps class very interesting. She's easy going and can relate to the students. I wish i could take her again."
6396,2186342,5.0,3.0,Michelle is the BEST english teacher. She gives quite a bit of homework just so you can keep your grade up if you don't do well on a paper. Her class is SO MUCH FUN. You do something interesting everyday. She is also hilarious. I wish i could take her again.
6397,1506415,2.0,3.0,"Professor had some problems during semester and vanished. Eventually the school pulled in another professor to take over. Then, out of nowhere, the professor reappeared. It has been a very frustrating experience. Most of the grades have not yet been posted. Part of our instruction was to rely on other class members to resolve issues."
6398,2407539,5.0,3.0,"She will really take the time to answer any questions you have, so don't hesitate to ask! She will not make you feel dumb, or be condescending like other professors, and really wants you to understand what is going on. The homework is tedious and somewhat long, but it really is helpful."
6399,2407539,2.0,4.0,The class is hard because its a new way of doing accounting. She doesnt require the online hw. She has problems in the book she assigns for hw. She gives the answers in class but its difficult to figure out how she got the answers. She will help you but there is only one of her and several students trying to get her help.
6400,2407539,2.0,4.0,This was her first semester to TAKE or TEACH this class ever. She was very unprepared yet fairly knowledgeable which I would say was her one saving grace. She used powerpoints provided by the book yet claimed that she made them. Very displeased by this class.
6401,2309253,2.0,3.0,Dr. K frequently made excuses for not grading papers quickly.  We would go at least a month after turning in assignments or exams before receiving a grade. She would occasionally blame the class for doing poorly on exams or assignments when her lecture notes were lean on content and she sometimes refused to give us supplemental material.
6402,2309253,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Knizley is one of the best professors I have had at MSU. I learned so much and she was great for ESD. If you can find old tests, the tests in here should not be too hard. Projects are the hardest part of ESD. Get a good group. She gives extra credit and really cares about us. Only complaint is that she took a long time to grade projects."
6403,2309253,1.0,3.0,Can't emphasize how lazy she is. Takes forever to give grades back and thinks our education is some sort of game. She's the head teacher for Thermo and she lets you know it. Take Morgan Green for Thermo if you can 
6404,2309253,2.0,4.0,"Lazy, feels like her students are up against her. The majority of things done in class are not useful at all. Take Morgan Green for Thermo 1 if possible."
6405,2309253,2.0,4.0,"Very difficult grader, gives grades back very late, sometimes months after the assignment was due. Also is very difficult to reach, especially over email."
6406,2309253,5.0,5.0,"Knizley is one of the best Ive had so far as a ME student. She is tough in thermo 1 but if you put forth all the effort she will help you but dont expect any hand outs. Time is your enemy in this class especially on tests. Do the hw, study and look at outside sources if you dont understand the material and youll do fine."
6407,2309253,5.0,4.0,"In my opinion, Dr. Knizley is the gold standard of ME profs at MSU. She works very hard to teach students well and protect the integrity of an ME degree. Notes consist of following along while she writes on the board. She has an open door policy too. She won't spoon-feed you, but she will make darn sure that you know thermo well."
6408,1850554,1.0,4.0,"Cory Lockhart is the worst professor I have ever had. He does not grade papers in a reasonable amount of time. He does not specify his requirements, then gets mad when people mess up. He's very irritable, it's pretty bad. Every little thing pisses this guy off. He's a terrible person, and an even worse professor. Please do not take him. Please."
6409,1850554,1.0,4.0,He has an AWFUL attitude and piles on the homework when he is in a bad mood. Extremely moody and passive aggressive. Gets annoyed with every little thing. Is not clear at all with what you should write for the stack of papers he assigns. Gives tons of notes that don't even help. Not approachable or friendly on any day. DO NOT TAKE NO MATTER WHAT!!!
6410,1850554,5.0,1.0,Easy teacher. you will have 4 papers to write the whole year. you will need to use your book.
6411,1850554,1.0,5.0,"He's never clear as to what he wants in his essays, does not give grades back in a decent amount of time, and a really tough grader. "
6412,1850554,1.0,5.0,He's a terrible teacher. Don't take him!!!!! He grades tough and gets irritated by any little thing.
6413,1850554,1.0,5.0,"His notes on the first and second drafts are illegible. Grades harshly. I am an English major and this class was hard for me. He gets easily angered and when he does, he assigns a ton of homework. This class was ridiculous and I wish I had selected a different teacher."
6414,1850554,1.5,3.0,He doesn't give enough feedback on first and second drafts and grades the final drafts harshly. He's monotone. Can get easily agitiated.
6415,720059,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Bruce is an amazing professor. His classes usually don't involve many tests. Instead, a lot of his grade comes from small 1-3 question quizzes that he gives out. The only test was the final. His lectures are very entertaining, but he still makes sure you understand what he's trying to teach. Overall, a very fun but very good professor."
6416,720059,4.5,3.0,"Cool, Fun & Practical."
6417,720059,3.5,5.0,"Lofty Expectations for his students.  Expects you to *know* everything you've learned throughout your ECE career.  Know your fundamentals (KCL, KVL, etc.) and how to apply them in the real world and you should be okay."
6418,2727100,4.0,2.0,"Eccentric, shy, and good natured. Will have class outside at every opportunity. He's a holocaust/fascism historian and has a very solid grounding in European literature. If you get to know him, he may lend you a book or two that he thinks you'll like, and he's usually right."
6419,2727100,5.0,3.0,"I will never be able to express how much I love this professor. He is funny and caring and makes class enjoyable. But be ready to read and participate in class. He gives pop quizzes over books and a few writing assignments. The bulk of your grade is in 2 papers but he gives you feedback. If you ever have the chance, take Dr. Peaple."
6420,2727100,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Peaple is my favorite professor by FAR. Hes the kindest man youll ever meet. Loves what he teaches, and is great at it. His accent is fun too. He offers a million extra credit movies to watch, and is extremely lenient with due dates. Do your best to read the content. Its a lot, but its important for the class."
6421,1359038,4.5,2.0,Dr. Drumheller was a fantastic teacher. You definitely need to participate and go to class. If you do you'll definitely pass. He enjoys feedback in lecture. Definitely a wonderful class and professor. 
6422,1359038,3.5,1.0,The guy is a total jerk and super into himself. He's ultra condescending but his class is easy if you go and take really good notes.
6423,1359038,5.0,2.0,Great!! Loved the way he taught. very funny if you actually pay attention to him. No text required but you need to take notes the entire time he is teaching. tests aren't to bad. overall he is great :D
6424,1359038,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Drumheller is one of the strangest people I have ever met. I had him for Interpersonal Relationships and he does not require a book. He does, however, make you take notes the entire time, but his lecture are so interesting I didn't mind. His tests are super easy. Overall, it was a fun and interesting class."
6425,163022,4.5,4.0,"Hank Flick is the greatest teacher at MSU. Interviewing, or as he calls it ""Competitive Interviewing,"" is absolutely the most useful class you could possibly take in terms of actually needing this in the real world. He's kind of like having Robin Williams for a teacher. The class isn't easy, but he makes it fun. Also, sit in the front row. "
6426,163022,3.0,1.0,"Probably the craziest and funniest profs I've ever had. Ill be talking about him and telling stories from his class to my children. One of a kind.  If you sit on the front row, he WILL pick on you! ha"
6427,163022,5.0,3.0,Hank is the man when it comes to preparing students to go out in the world and interact in small group communications and interviewing situations I found even following graduation i still use some of the techniques he instilled.
6428,163022,3.5,2.0,"Hank is definitely the zaniest teacher I've ever had.  You'll do a lot of activities in class that are pretty simple, but interesting and he outlines all work, so overall it's a pretty great class to take."
6429,163022,5.0,5.0,Awesome teacher!!! One of the best best EVER!!  He teaches things that help you in LIFE!!  Take anything he teaches to help you succeed in life!!
6430,163022,5.0,1.0,"The interviewing class has been the most useful class I've ever taken. It's an AWESOME class. He's a great prof, one of the best at State. That class was one of the smartest things I ever did at State."
6431,163022,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Flick is great. He gives out studygudes for the final, with page references to each topic, and makes the class fun and entertaining. This is the only class I havn't cut once this year. Ask about Ralphie."
6432,163022,4.5,4.0,Dr. Flick taught me skills that were for the real world.  I use them daily and realize now that I didn't appreciate how good of a teacher he was.  Thank you Dr. Flick!
6433,163022,4.5,1.0,"Dr. Flick is a very good teacher.  He is very demanding, but what you will learn in his class will stick with you.  Definitely take him."
6434,163022,5.0,1.0,Flick was the best professor I had at MSU. I'm still using what I learned in his Small Group and Interviewing classes in the real world. He's hilarious and kind and really loves MSU.
6435,2473184,5.0,4.0,"Pretty nice dude. He posts the slides online and the lectures are directly from the slides. There's a lot of pop quizzes, though, so it's a bad idea to skip class. If you can't focus during the lecture, just make sure you review the slides afterward and you'll be fine."
6436,2473184,2.0,4.0,"The lectures are boring and hard to understand and follow, you have no time to copy anything down before he changes the slide. The quizzes are open notes, but are only worth 2 points and can significantly impact your grade. He is a nice person, but can be hard to get in touch with."
6437,2473184,2.0,4.0,"He means well, but it's really hard to keep up with him in class and sometimes he's hard to understand. He also grades weird, so if you don't do well on one test, you better make a 100 on everything else."
6438,2718966,4.0,3.0,I love Ms Stanhope! She was funny and posted the textbook in canvas so we didnt have to buy it. The exams were easy and she gave extra credit for the kahoots she made. Pretty good class fr
6439,2718966,4.0,2.0,She was really sweet and the lectures were always really fun. The tests were super easy if you took notes and paid attention in class. She also did a lot of Kahoots which were both fun and very helpful.
6440,2129147,3.0,4.0,Her tests were open notes but if you did not review you would not do good. Homework was way harder than the examples in the notes. Gave good partial credit for the tests and did curve the grade at the end. Responded pretty quick with emails. She made amazing effort to teach us when her WiFi was down by teaching from the Walmart parking lot.
6441,2129147,1.0,1.0,"Nandadasa is nice, but she is not a good teacher at all. Her slides are straight from the textbook, &amp; she doesn't actually teach material needed for homework or on exams. She spends class time deriving equations instead of actually showing how to use them, and she is not easily understood due to poor communication skills. Do not take. 0 out of 10"
6442,2129147,1.0,5.0,"So bad. Her lectures consisted of her reading word for word from the powerpoint slides the TEXTBOOK provides. Didn't even make her own notes. She has a thick accent which makes her difficult to understand. The only upside is that she isn't that tough of a grader, but of course that involves knowing what is happening on the tests, which I did not."
6443,2129147,4.0,3.0,"SUCH a sweet woman! Her teaching style is based solely on conceptual examples, never using quantitative problems in class. However, she grades very easy and her tests directly reflect the content of lectures and homework."
6444,2129147,3.0,3.0,"Must attend this class to pass because she does not post any notes online. TAKE GOOD NOTES in this class and you should do ok on the tests. She sends out really long reviews for the test, but if you know how to work all the examples in the notes, you don't have to worry about the review. Homework is harder than the tests."
6445,490748,5.0,1.0,"There is a definite reason she is called Mrs. Fun! Easy class, do not really have to show up to pass. Love her!"
6446,490748,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Fun is the absolute best! Her love for her students is evident, and she can make anyone smile! I would recommend her to anyone, even if you're just taking one of her 1 hr. courses. Her classes are well worth your time, especially History and Appreciation of Dance! She always makes class very interesting."
6447,490748,3.0,2.0,"Her lesson has no structure. She bounces topic to topic and your notes are a crazy mix of subjects, but her tests are straight forward."
6448,490748,3.0,2.0,"She's really like a mom or a grandmother. Very care-free. Has about five grades in total. I've written 4 papers for homework though so keep that in mind. If you are taking this for an art credit there are much better options but if you are taking it for a PE credit and like dance, this may be the class for you."
6449,490748,4.0,1.0,"FUN, EASY AND HELPFUL, KINDA LIKE THAT COOL MOM FROM YOUR GROUP OF FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL"
6450,490748,5.0,1.0,She is called Mrs. Fun for a reason!
6451,490748,5.0,1.0,she's like my mom.
6452,490748,4.5,3.0,She's really awesome!
6453,1219842,4.0,5.0,He gives interesting lectures but his test are very difficult.  He requires many papers to be written in the honors level course.  Loves 5 page papers.
6454,1219842,4.0,5.0,"Very smart man, will do anything for you as long as you're not a dummy and slacker. Don't let his sterness scare you away. He knows what he's talking about and if you are confused then just ask questions."
6455,2333954,5.0,2.0,He is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He honestly cares so much about his students and really wants them to succeed. Would definitely recommend for him for any class. He makes class fun and is just an all round amazing teacher
6456,2628876,3.0,4.0,"not the worst prof of all time. shes nice and helpful, but she teaches extremely fast. her powerpoints are 100 slides and she rushes through them. I ended up having to take notes outside of class because she goes too fast to write much of anything. other than that, its just study and you'll pass."
6457,2628876,5.0,1.0,"Ms. Katkar is a very sweet woman. I had her for Earth Science I and I only showed up maybe 4 times that semester and got an A. She posts powerpoint online and has study guides for tests. Very easy class, would definitely recommend."
6458,2628876,4.0,1.0,"Has an accent and can be hard to understand, but it is very easy material in this class. Tests and quizzes are online. She is kind and cares, and she typically responds quickly to email."
6459,2374930,1.0,2.0,She only gave our group a week for our project while gave everyone else 2 weeks not fair at all. She was really strict to and gave me a bad grade on my outline that I worked hard on. Her lectures were so boring not entertaining at all. Would not take this class again. She was a really tough grader.
6460,2374930,5.0,2.0,This class was very easy if you are a mindful writer and listen to her lectures. I found that she graded easier than a lot of professors when it came to mistakes in my writing. She is really nice and the amount of work given is very fair!
6461,2374930,1.0,2.0,"If you're a DG, don't take her she is very biased. Tough group grader yet shockingly loved my individual work. Offered extra credit yet did not accept it on the last day of finals LIKE PROFS ARE SUPPOSED TO. Slow to email responses, not understanding, cancels class a lot. Will not really work with you. Harsh grader. Called my work a disappointment."
6462,2374930,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Gordon is a fantastic professor. She has really gone out of her way this semester to accommodate students for online learning. She leaves constructive feedback on assignments, is very clear about what she expects, and tries to make her class fun. I really, really appreciate how considerate she has been this semester by not overwhelming us."
6463,2374930,3.0,4.0,"Mrs. Gordon is nice enough... her lectures are incredibly boring, though. She doesn't seem to lecture about things that you're going to need to know, however."
6464,2374930,2.0,3.0,"Mrs. Gordon is nice. Nice doesn't equal good. Lectures and book don't prepare you for exams, so it's virtually impossible to get above an 80. That means if you want an A, you better have a very high speech grade. If you aren't the most comfortable with public speaking, steer clear. There are way too many good options to get stuck here."
6465,2374930,4.0,4.0,"Tough grader, but overall for a good reason. She will count off for every mistake but does give you the opportunity to fix them for credit. The lectures are extremely boring, but attendance is mandatory, so you'll have to be there. As a person, she's very nice and willing to help if you're having trouble."
6466,2374930,4.0,5.0,"Meaghan Gordon is a very tough grader. She counts off for every mistake, but it makes you a better writer. If you go to her office hours or email her she will check! Make sure you are focused during the group work during the first few weeks of the semester. It will sneak up on you and you will have to climb out of the hole like me :)"
6467,2374930,4.0,4.0,Will count off for every mistake which is what you want. Make sure you proof read everything and look up in the book what you don't know. Lectures are boring but you have to go for attendance.
6468,2374930,2.0,5.0,"I would strongly suggest taking another professor. When she lectured in class, she lectured like a tape recorder. Very tough grader and she WILL count off for every mistake. Honestly I didnt have a problem with that, shes also not the nicest person! Take someone else....I strongly advise."
6469,2374930,5.0,3.0,I took her for PR Writing. Good teacher! She makes class interesting and gives clear instructions.
6470,2301206,5.0,3.0,Very good class online. She was quick to answer questions and responded to assignments. Good recorded lectures and supplemented with Ted talks and videos.
6471,2243873,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Bhowmik is very passionate about software engineering. He is a great professor and his class is very manageable. Beware, the laboratory is a large group project that lasts the entire semester. The project might require a large investment in learning a new programming language. A bonus is that you do learn/apply full stack development. "
6472,2243873,5.0,2.0,Great professor for discrete. Had the class laid out very nice and quizzes were not hard at all. I heard discrete was a very hard class but he made it seem easy. I would recommend Mr. Bhowmik for any class he teaches. (Accent is a little difficult at first but you get used to it)
6473,2243873,4.0,4.0,"5-ish question quiz every week, not weighted heavily. Homework every other week checked for completion, weighted heavily(turn these in on time). 3 tests weighted heavily. Quizzes are not hard but you do have to memorize the previous lectures slides which is difficult. Material isn't too hard(except proofs) but you have to spend time memorizing it."
6474,2563363,4.0,3.0,"Dr. McKinney is overall a great professor! You can tell that he really cares about his students and wants you to succeed. Sometimes we didn't cover everything in lecture because he gets passionate, but he will help you outside of class and he curved every exam!"
6475,2563363,5.0,4.0,"experimental is pretty hard due to the labs that take several hours, but him and the grad students are helpful if you are struggling. some of the grad students graded a bit harsh (be wary of that) but he fixed some grades for us and said we could fix our mistakes. he made weekly update videos and was always available if we needed help/had questions"
6476,2563363,5.0,4.0,I took him for experimental psy. this class is difficult and there is a lot of work. You have weekly lecture videos and quizzes and a lab assignment. The book is required if you want to do well on weekly quizzes and exams. The quizzes are normally 4-5 questions with 8 min to complete. The exams are 50 questions. Put in the work and you will do well
6477,2489639,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Hall is one of the nicest professors I have ever had. Intro to logic has lots of homework and isn't an easy A, but if you put in a little work, you'll finish with an A. Do the readings she assigns because she gives random quizzes that are easy if you at least even glanced over the readings."
6478,2489639,1.0,3.0,Gives alot of homework and even has homework due over breaks. She does not know what she is talking about. The only reason to show up for class is to take the quizzes. She gives pop quizzes and that sometimes too indept. Would not recommend if it is for an elective.
6479,2489639,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Hall is great! She's so nice and her class was enjoyable. Since this is a philosophy course, the readings can be quite confusing, but she explains everything clearly and makes it easy to understand. Assignments (tests and in-class activities) are essay-based, but if you put in effort, you will do well."
6480,441641,3.5,3.0,"He tries keeping the class interesting, by following the PowerPoint slide; however, his tests are hard. You have to read the book carefully. I studied, but got a C. Read the book thoroughly!!"
6481,441641,2.5,3.0,"Didn't think he explained the material well, tests were extremely difficult. Must read the chapter carefully. Most of my friends who took this class with me also received C's... and we studied."
6482,441641,1.0,5.0,The professor is not teaching well. His test are really hard and he give loads of homework. I strongly not to take this professor.
6483,441641,3.0,4.0,"The class seems easy, but the tests are super hard! You have to read the chapter very carefully, not just look at powerpoint slides."
6484,441641,4.5,4.0,"Very articulate and knowledgable. Keeps your interest in the subject high at all times, which makes you work harder and do better. Also fair and auassuming. Overall, one of the most effective teachers I have ever had."
6485,441641,4.5,2.0,No Comments
6486,441641,2.5,4.0,He is very hard to get along with.  Either he likes you or doesn't!  VERY expectant of students...
6487,441641,4.5,3.0,"Great lecturer, very knowledgable.  Expects students to do their share and participate.  He strikes some as haughty, but he respects good students."
6488,2211115,4.0,1.0,"He is a very easy teacher, but gives very long lectures. During his lectures he asks study guide questions which are actually the exam questions. If you show up and get the correct answers for these study guide questions, you will easily pass his class. He also randomly assigns in class assignments which are a small portion of your grade."
6489,2211115,3.0,2.0,"really easy class, power points posted online each week, Craig is very interested in what he teaches but presents it in a way that is really really boring, i fell asleep in class a lot"
6490,2211115,1.0,3.0,Made us buy a textbook just for two homework assignments. Powerpoints were made for this mans class. Dont get me started on his monotone and nasal voice. He doesnt really move from behind the podium. Says things straight from powerpoint and then says But you dont really need to know that right now.
6491,2211115,5.0,2.0,"He's super boring but the class is easy. Go to class because he occasionally makes you do in-class assignments worth a certain percent of your grade. His tests are super easy, he puts questions on the powerpoints and answers them. Those questions are the exact same questions on the test. Gives extra credit and curves the test 4%. Only 2 hw assigned"
6492,2211115,3.0,2.0,"His lectures are extremely boring and he over explains some topics, but he's a fair grader and will make sure that you get a good grade in the class if you are working for it."
6493,2211115,3.0,3.0,"He is a very nice guy.  The class is an easy A if you just pay attention, but that is the problem.  The class is a long lecture which is very boring and hard to pay attention.  He will give generous extra credit so make sure you do it.  He is an easy grader but the tests can be hard."
6494,441644,5.0,4.0,"I found this class to be very challenging. A lot of memorizing lecture slides. Lots of homework grades, so you'll have to have a book. If you miss more than 5 classes, you'll automatically fail. If you listen in class, everything is a lot easier to learn. Very thorough tests. She makes the class super interesting."
6495,441644,4.0,3.0,Good teacher. Kinda hippie.
6496,441644,4.0,2.0,"It's an informative class that's easy to study for with outlined notes and the homework is easy to accomplish, as well.  Her attendance policy is pretty rigorous, though, and she calls you out in class.  It's uncomfortable at first, but it doesn't take to long to adjust to."
6497,441644,5.0,4.0,No Comments
6498,441644,5.0,2.0,One of my favorite teachers.
6499,441645,4.0,4.0,He is a good teacher. His tests can be a little tricky. There is no hw just 3 exams. He will call on you and learns everyone's name. You have to sit in the same seat for every class. He gives you the notes for the class that you print out. He is funny at times but can be rude. He hates technology- no phones or laptops.
6500,441645,4.0,3.0,"Out of all the classes I have taken from MSU, this is one ive learned the most information in. Attendance is not mandatory and all of his lecture follow from a powerpoint that you print out and bring to class, So no textbook needed. However there are only three tests total with no Homework and you will get your phone taken if you are on it in class"
6501,441645,5.0,4.0,Great teacher recommended highly
6502,441645,4.0,4.0,"Liano is a great professor, his lectures were always interactive and funny. The only problems with this class is that there are no electronics allowed, and the only thing that counts for your grade are 3 tests."
6503,441645,4.0,4.0,"His tests are hard, but if you go into his office after to talk about the test he will give you points back if you prove to him you understand the material. He gives bonus quizzes at the end of class that are usually easy and those points will be added to your test grade."
6504,441645,2.5,4.0,"He's a nice man. He writes everything on the chalk board because his English is hard to understand. Does not tolerate cell phones in the classroom, he will take it away from you after 2 warnings. He calls you out period if you are not paying attention. He learns everyone's name and calls on people directly for answers. "
6505,441645,4.5,4.0,Great teacher and accessible outside of class.  Quick email responsiveness to questions.
6506,441645,3.5,3.0,Very funny. Good teacher.
6507,441645,4.0,3.0,"very funny guy, fun class"
6508,2342189,1.0,4.0,"I took Nettles for chem 1, and was fine, but chem 2 was much different. She was extremely unforgiving with homework (any errors in format, submission, etc. resulted in a 0). Lectures were worse and worse as the year went on (reading from slides only). Most kids failed the only test we had, and huge curves had to be given to compensate."
6509,2342189,1.0,4.0,Going to class was mostly rambling about something we already understood for the majority of the time and then rushing through 10 slides at the end. Often gets confused and says the wrong information. Homeworks were graded ridiculously hard for no reason.
6510,2342189,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Nettles tried her best and did care with this class. However, Chem 2 was not set up in the best manner, primarily due to how heavily weighted the last 2 exams were in comparison to everything else, and the lack of a curve despite having low averages. She often went on tangents, and while well meaning, another instructor may be better"
6511,2342189,4.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Nettles for Chem 1 and had a good experience. While I wasn't always a fan of the lecturing style, it was effective. Recitation and office hours were helpful in ensuring a good grade and that the materials were understood. She gave an extra credit opportunity at the end of the course which was a nice bump for my grade."
6512,2342189,1.0,5.0,"Chem 2.Took nettles post pandemic. TAs are maniacs, they're very tough when it comes to grading homework. Lectures were all over the place as she doesn't know how to stay on a tangent. A lot of info she gives you during lectures are irrelevant since she goes off of a tangent quite a bit. If you want to pass, stick to studying notes and the website."
6513,2342189,4.0,4.0,Mrs Nettles is a very understanding professor. She cared about all of her students doing well even if running off of caffeine and nicotine. Her lectures are interesting but frequently went on tangents often times more interesting the class material.
6514,2342189,3.0,3.0,"Nettles is a good teacher for Chem 1 if you took chem in high school and already know most of the material. She is probably the best option for Chem 1. For Chem 2, take Dornshuld if possible, he is MUCH more straightforward in lectures. Nettles gets sidetracked way too often and tells you info you will never use. In short, Nettles is overrated"
6515,2342189,5.0,4.0,"I had Dr. Nettles for both Chem 1 and Chem 2. Chem 2 is especially challenging, but Dr. Nettles does everything she can to help her students succeed. She added an extra office hour on Fridays so that more students could receive help from her. Additionally, she holds review sessions to help prepare for the exams. She is an outstanding professor. "
6516,2342189,5.0,3.0,Don't let a bunch of bad reviews of Dr. Nettles scare you. She is an awesome professor and will try her best to teach the material in ways that everyone can understand. Most of the complaints were about the Hw. She warned students at the beginning that it was going to be strict. TL;DR She's awesome and the Chem dept sucks
6517,2342189,5.0,3.0,Don't let a bunch of bad reviews of Dr. Nettles scare you. She is an amazing professor and will try her best to teach the material in ways that everyone can understand. Most of the complaints were about the Hw. She warned students at the beginning that it was going to be strict. TL;DR She's awesome and the Chem dept sucks
6518,2342189,1.0,5.0,"Nettles would be a decent teacher if the material she taught was on the exams, but chooses instead to focus on material that isn't relevant, since Dornshul makes the exams. Both the Chem 2 prof act as if this is your only class. TAs grade too strict on homework and 2 exams make half of your grade, while the average for the the exam worth 30% was 50"
6519,2342189,2.0,5.0,"If you read the last few ratings, it's easy to tell that her teaching ability is on the decline. Not only are her lectures erratic, she falls behind easy and makes up for it by speeding thru things that are crucial to understand for the overall class. The testing and HW format is also terrible. Take Dornshuld for Chem 2 or Mlsna to avoid 2 finals."
6520,2342189,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Nettles is nice, but she is just all over the place. I don't think I even learned anything. I heard worse about other Chem I professors, so she's not too bad. The chem department in general just sucks. "
6521,2342189,3.0,1.0,"Had Dr. Nettles for chem 1, class itself was pretty easy. She kind of lectures like an inspirational speaker. The chem department isn't great, but thats not dr. nettles fault. Class has a couple in person tests, and required recitation. Recitation isn't really worth it but is required for a grade"
6522,2342189,3.0,2.0,"Dr. nettles over all is a good professor and does really care about the success of her student. But the chem dept. itself is pretty bad. The homeworks are graded very tough, but the other prof. for chem 2 controls how things are graded, not dr. nettles. I would prefer her over other options for both chem 1 and 2. "
6523,2342189,1.0,4.0,"HW grading is terrible. 0's are given out left and right. If you forget to show a simple calculation (simplifying J to kJ) you will get the entire question incorrect, regardless of if the other work was correct. Refuses to give partial credit on homework. 2 tests given at the end of the semester count for 50% of your grade. Chem here is horrendous."
6524,2342189,1.0,5.0,"She gives zeros on assignments for the most petty reasons, such as missing units on one question, missing your name on one of the sheets, or forgetting to mark one homework question as complete. She gives as many zeros as possible to avoid having to spend time doing her job. If you have to take Chem 2, change your major."
6525,2342189,3.0,4.0,"The current class format for Chem 2 is absolutely terrible. This is on top of the downright STRANGE homework grading that will make you lose ~1.3 percent of your overall grade every time you forget extremely small details in your work...on homework. Nettles as a professor is okay and understandable, but PLEASE change back to traditional exam format"
6526,2342189,3.0,4.0,"So, I love Dr nettles. Probably best professor for chem 1 and 2. However, I am now in chem 2 and she decided to shake it up a bit. And now the class is horrible. The way she has constructed it, makes it so you essentially have two finals. Also, the homework grading criteria is ABSOLUTELY horrendous and petty. I recommend taking chem 2 at a juco..."
6527,2342189,5.0,4.0,"I love Dr. Nettles, she is an amazing teacher and cares for students. She had a lot of homework but it really does help you understand the material. I think if I didn't have the homework I would not have done well on the exams. There are 3 exams and the final. She does give some extra credit at the end of the semester."
6528,2342189,5.0,4.0,Amazing teacher
6529,2342189,3.0,5.0,"If anyone were to choose a chemistry professor, they should definitely choose Dr. Nettles. She grades harshly on homework and other assignments, but overall she is a wonderful professor and person. The class was hard for me since I have not had a lot of chemistry background, but I worked hard and learned many things from this class."
6530,2342189,4.0,2.0,"Nettles was a great chemistry teacher and really cares about her students. I will be taking her again next semester. Taking this class while taking chem lab 1 took a substantial amount of time to do weekly assignments. The chemistry textbook is provided, but not needed to pass."
6531,2342189,3.0,4.0,"If you were to choose a chemistry teacher, she is probably your best bet. She is not bad at teaching, but she gives you tons of work. She will grade harshly on the HW from 1-9. Failing to even put something as simple as the date can result in a zero. It is unfair and has resulted me to fail my class."
6532,2342189,3.0,4.0,"Best teacher from chem department. A good teacher, I personally should have taken advantage of office hours. Lots of homework. The timed quizzes for her posted lecture videos really really sucked. Added so much more stress than necessary. I did like that she posted the lecture videos in the first place. I hate chem, but she's not a bad professor."
6533,2342189,4.0,5.0,Dr. Nettles is the best option for Chemistry teacher! Her class is difficult but she does a great job with the material and definetly cares alot about her students!
6534,2342189,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Nettles is the best. You will have to work hard (but you would have to do that in Chem 1 and 2 anyway), but she teaches the material well, and if you reach out to her with questions she will do what she can to help you."
6535,2342189,5.0,4.0,She really honestly cares about her students and wants them to succeed.
6536,2342189,5.0,3.0,"I had Nettles for Chem 1 and Chem 2. She is an amazing professor! She cares about you, which is important. Chem II is a hard course (with only 2 exams and a final), but Nettles helps you get through it. I highly recommend going to CGSA help sessions! Also, take advantage of the FUN exam."
6537,2342189,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Nettles is very kind and wants her students to succeed. She teaches the material decently well and is worth taking. The 1/5 rating is for the way the chem department did the tests in Fall 20/Spring 21. The livestream on twitch format is awful, they give you a time limit on each question which causes lots of anxiety. It's terrible"
6538,2342189,4.0,5.0,"Ok so I hate chemistry. Always have. Nettles is great and super enthusiastic, so that probably helped. But it doesn't help that the testing format is straight up cracked. The class sucks, but its doable (barely)."
6539,2342189,5.0,3.0,Dr. Nettles teaches very well and really cares for her students. Shes very willing to help you if you ask. She also gives bonus questions on the test and multiple attempts on her quizzes.
6540,2342189,5.0,3.0,"Nettles is great for Chem I. The material is difficult, but she is very passionate about what she teaches. Both her class and lecture videos are interesting for what it is. Don't expect this course to be an easy A. Homework is the best way to learn how to do the math and prepare for the test. The quizzes aren't too bad."
6541,2342189,2.0,5.0,Bounces around too much
6542,2342189,5.0,5.0,You can tell that Dr Nettles really cares about her students and their success.  She does everything in her power to make a notoriously difficult course as easy as possible.
6543,2342189,3.0,5.0,"Prof. Nettles was a decent professor, there were just very long lectures that were packed with information. Many of the examples on the PowerPoints weren't helpful in relation to the homework and sometimes exams, so it takes time to understand the material. I struggled with this class since there was always difficult information and hard exams."
6544,2342189,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Nettles is definitely the best Chem teacher at Miss State. She was good for Chem1 in 2019 Chem2 in 2021 is horrible. The tests are completely unfair and we cant get partial credit. Worst test format I have ever taken. It sets you up to fail. I would recommend that no one take Chem2 at Miss State. If you have to, take her. But dont take it."
6545,2342189,5.0,3.0,"Nettles is by far the best Chem professor at MS State. Definitely recommend her over others. I had Sidney Creutz for Chem I, and barely understood what we were learning. If you pay attention in class and do the homework, you'll do just fine in her class. She also makes sure that students know how much she cares about them and their success."
6546,2342189,5.0,4.0,"The chem department has a bad rap at MSU, however, Dr. Nettles is seriously the best professor. I took her chem 1 class online and chem 2 class in-person. Chem is definitely better in person, she's easy to listen to. The homework is difficult but very necessary for your overall grade. Gives easy, generous extra credit. Very strict on late grades."
6547,2342189,4.0,4.0,"Although I took this class online, she was still a great professor. She made class straight forward and made it clear what she expected. She was accessible outside of class multiple times a week and cared about our success in her class. She holds office hours on twitch so go ahead and make a creative name. Definitely recommend."
6548,2342189,4.0,3.0,"I took this class asynchronous online during Fall 2020. It was challenging to take this course online, especially since it is a hard science. However, Dr. Nettles was very generous and offered review sessions before every exam. She was also accessible during office hours. She is probably your best bet for Chemistry 1."
6549,2342189,3.0,5.0,"I'm going to be honest: if you need to take chemistry for your major, but struggle with it, consider taking it through a junior college. This class is extremely hard. That said, Dr. Nettles is probably the best chem teacher at MSU (at least, for me). Super nice. You're definitely gonna have to put in the work. She gives a lot of homework!"
6550,2342189,5.0,5.0,Best chem teacher there is! So sweet and very willing to help you. Holds homework sessions like 2/3 times a week and gives one on one instruction. Definitely love her!
6551,2342189,5.0,5.0,Class was hard and requires lots of work and responsibility. Make sure to stay on top of topics covered in class and dont forget homework! Nettles is a great professor. Shes cool and takes the time to break down the more difficult concepts in class.
6552,2342189,5.0,3.0,The best Chemistry teacher at Mississippi State! She is so helpful and always accessible outside of class. It is a hard subject but she makes it easy to understand. Wish I could take her again!
6553,2342189,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Nettles is the best teacher possible for CH1213. Very passionate, cares about her students and their success, and is always available outside of class to answer any questions or provide any help."
6554,2342189,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Nettles is the best chemistry teacher you could ask for. She will go above and beyond for her students and do everything she can to help them succeed. It is exceedingly obvious that she is passionate about chemistry, and truly cares for her students. Do everything you can to get her for chemistry."
6555,2342189,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Nettles is your best bet for Chemistry 1 professors at Mississippi State. The class is tough but she does whatever she can to help you succeed. She is very passionate about Chemistry, which is shown through her enthusiasm in class and examples. Always available in study hours and commonly holds study halls. TAKE HER"
6556,2342189,4.0,5.0,"Bad news: chemistry at MSU is AWFUL. Good news: Dr. Nettles is great. She's your best bet for learning the material. She's super passionate, offers lots of help and practice, and wants you to learn. The exams are written by multiple prof's and WAY harder than the homework, so get ready to grind and prepare for the worst. Study hard and good luck."
6557,2342189,5.0,3.0,Absolute queen. Sat in on her class because all the MSU Chem I professors are absolutely god awful. She actually makes the material understandable and is your only chance of passing Chem I. God bless her.
6558,2342189,5.0,5.0,She is the best chemistry professor that MSU has. She has helped me thoroughly understand the material and is very accessible outside of class. She is also very engaging in class and is enthusiastic about chemistry. She is the only chance at passing chem 1.
6559,2342189,4.0,3.0,Nettles is your best AND ONLY bet at getting the most you can out of Chem I. Shes really hands on with explaining the concepts and does multiple examples in order for everyone to be on the same page. She goes the extra mile to help anyone who needs help and has a quirky personality.
6560,2342189,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Nettles is the best option you've got at MSU for chemistry. She's clearly passionate about chemistry and cares about her students. Chemistry was still a challenge, but she made it bearable and kept us motivated. She started a weekly study session that was extremely helpful and worth it. You still have to work for your grade, but she'll help."
6561,2342189,4.0,3.0,Hard subject but she made it as easy as possible. Quizzes every week were pretty difficult but most of them were group quizzes. Tests seemed impossible but gave pretty generous extra credit at the end of the semester. Homework every week is also long and fairly difficult. Very helpful and genuinely cares about her students.
6562,2342189,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Nettles is great! Her lectures simply chemistry as much as possible, and she makes chemistry bearable. She gives lots of quizzes (some group quizzes) and homework but is very accessible outside of class. She's very funny and caring. She's a great choice for chem."
6563,2342189,5.0,3.0,"Nettles is not the teacher for lab, she is the overseer of chemistry labs at MSU. She is very helpful and understanding. If you need help with labs, feel free to visit her office. You will probably never see her in the actual lab unless she drops by to check in."
6564,2342189,2.0,1.0,if you are a freshman that knows nothing about profs at MSU then you need to know that in the chem 1 lab (CH1211) that Nettles won't actually be the person in your class. You have a TA that does everything (including grading). I saw Nettles twice the entire semester in my lab for 30 secs and all she ever did was yell at kids to cover their ankles.
6565,2342189,3.0,4.0,"I made A's on all her tests. Failed all of the pop quizzes. She ended up dropping two quiz grades though. And she changed some grades at the end of the semester. Final is curved A LOT. Her lectures didn't help me very much, but her handwritten notes and extra practice problems helped a lot. She would literally throw tantrums sometimes though. Moody"
6566,2342189,4.0,4.0,"Nettles was a pretty good chemistry teacher. She went way above what was required for her to help the students learn. My only complaint about her is that she had a very short fuse, and would often snap during lecture for no reason."
6567,2342189,3.0,3.0,She is very helpful however chem is chem and will require practice.
6568,2342189,4.0,3.0,Whitnee Nettles is a decent professor. She definitely acknowledges the feedback given from the class. She gives quizzes at least every other class and sometimes theyre pop sometimes they arent. Theyre worth 10% of your grade so you better show up. She can be kinda moody especially if the class isnt participating!
6569,2342189,5.0,4.0,"Probably, no most definitely THE BEST lab coordinator I have EVER had. I will always remember her."
6570,2342189,5.0,4.0,Dr. Nettles will bend over backwards to help you. Highly recommended!
6571,2342189,2.0,5.0,"Dr. Nettles is an ineffective teacher. She usually reads directly off slides, and avoids most practice problems and examples in class. There's usually around 60 online homework problems per test, along with a few pages of paper homework. Avoid taking her for Chem 2 if possible."
6572,1735993,4.5,2.0,"Love love love this guy! He's very helpful and very entertaining during lecture. Book is not optional, if you're taking two semesters then I suggest buying the book. Tests are very straightforward as are quizzes. "
6573,1735993,5.0,2.0,Absolutely one of the best teachers I have ever had. Very helpful and understanding. I highly recommend taking his class. His classroom is a very relaxed setting and he has a lot of hilarious stories to make you feel more comfortable. He truly cares about his students and wants you to succeed.
6574,1735993,5.0,1.0,"He is wonderful. The assignments are easy, and he makes it clear what is expected on each assignment. I would recommend him to anyone wanting to learn French."
6575,1735993,4.0,1.0,"Very, very good French teacher. I recommend to attend all ""tutoring sessions"" more than likely you will get 5 points added to your next test. Super nice and helpful, most of the hw is not taken up for a grade; overall a very easy class. "
6576,1735993,5.0,2.0,Great teacher! I highly recommend him. & Gives bonus points for coming to French Table
6577,1735993,4.0,2.0,Great teacher!
6578,1735993,5.0,1.0,"Drew was a great teacher. He makes the class fun. It's a really easy course if you pay attention and do the homework (although he never took it up like he said he would). Plus, he's hot to look at."
6579,1735993,5.0,1.0,He is an excellent teacher. He teaches using plenty of examples. He is also always willing to help if you need it. I couldn't recommend him more.
6580,1850683,4.5,2.0,"this class is easy as long as you listen in class. She puts notes up online and her study guides are whats on the test. The only negative thing is that there is alot of online homework, but it only take about 10 min."
6581,1850683,4.5,4.0,Very helpful and wants to see her students succeed
6582,1850683,1.0,5.0,"She's super easy, and really awesome. She always reviews before tests, and they are not hard at all. You have to take weekly quizzes online, but they're open book."
6583,1850684,1.0,5.0,"He was a good lecturer, very entertaining. The study guides for the tests made you completely prepared. The tests are essay tests, and you are given the prompts before hand."
6584,2047297,5.0,4.0,He's so wonderful! Great musician and a caring person.
6585,2047297,5.0,5.0,great
6586,2825546,2.0,3.0,"Im the reviewer below this, just wanted to continue.PowerPoints are not useful at all and she writes herself a novel to read in front of the class and barely puts notes on the screen.Tries to use participation activities in a room of 200 people.Feels like middle school all over again.The discussion question on the test has only ONE correct answer."
6587,2825546,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Soares stopped class the other day bc someone walked out 30 mins after class started. She stopped her lecture to point out someone leaving and how it's a ""violation of the honor code."" In my opinion, this was very wrong of her bc how does she know what's happening in that person life? That's right she doesn't. This made me lose respect for her"
6588,2825546,1.0,3.0,She teaches her opinions more than the actual class.
6589,2825546,2.0,1.0,Dr. Soares' class is not exactly hard. The assignments are all online and she spends lectures going over them a lot. But I don't feel like I am getting much out of the class. I think for that reason it is a good course to take for those not expecting a deep dive into history. You won't really be challenged and the workload is manageable. 
6590,2727245,1.0,4.0,Stay away. Messes up on questions regularly and does not make anything clear. Works problems in his head and doesn't help you along.
6591,2727245,2.0,3.0,"He reads directly off the slides that are not informative, and the textbook is online. He speaks English well, but his accent was extremely hard to understand mainly due to the large class size. He holds office hours and that is where he is the most help. SI will be necessary if you take this professor. There are graded quizzes almost every class."
6592,2727245,2.0,5.0,"Munoz knows what he's talking about but he needs to work on lectures. His class has so many people that it can be hard to teach effectively. If you take his class, office hours are essential to your experience."
6593,2727245,1.0,2.0,ass
6594,2727245,1.0,5.0,"Terrible at teaching. Would ask the class if they were ready to move on from the concept, then move on anyway after people said no. He would work practice problems wrong, then after he didnt get the right answer he would tell us where he messed up, but didnt go back and work it again. I felt non prepared for chem 2 and its making my grade suffer"
6595,2727245,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Munoz is by far the worst professor I've ever had. He is arrogant, unhelpful, and his lecture style is very unorganized and difficult to follow. He seems to be decently knowledgeable in the field of chemistry, but unfortunately, he is terrible at teaching it."
6596,2727245,2.0,4.0,"Very knowledgeable, but not a good professor. He made tons of mistakes while lecturing, and at points ended up teaching concepts above our pay grade. Although I didn't personally, some people had a hard time understanding him through his accent. Not a bad professor, but it's worth exploring other options."
6597,2727245,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Munoz is a really great person. He's a really sweet guy, but he is a terrible teacher. He hardly knows how to work harder problems. He also could use a bit of work teaching lecture. Don't bother asking him a question; you'll just be more confused. I would suggest any other teacher for Chem I. Half of the time going to class doesn't help."
6598,2727245,1.0,4.0,Munoz was my first Professor at Mississippi State. By far the worst teacher I have ever had in a class teaching wise. This guy needs to learn how to speak English in the country he's teaching in. I was very good at Chemistry before I came here and his class punished me for thinking that. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
6599,2727245,1.0,5.0,By far the worst teach I have ever had. He forgets how to say stuff in English and he can hardly work the problems himself. Take anyone else or just wait to take it.
6600,2727245,2.0,3.0,"Take anyone else for Chemistry I if possible. He seems to be a nice guy, but his teaching skills are very poor. You'll have to learn most everything out of class or in SI."
6601,2727245,2.0,3.0,"First and foremost, I respect Munoz as a person. His lecturing skills could use some work, and he really struggles to communicate and teach more complicated concepts. SI sessions are basically required if you want to make a decent grade. Class is mostly skippable with a few exceptions for test review as that's the only worthwhile part of class."
6602,2727245,3.0,1.0,Not great at teaching during lectures. Goes really fast through notes and examples. Must go to office hours and SI sessions for sure.
6603,2309475,1.0,3.0,"He has been very condescending when students have asked for help, and he has been unable to give help other than &quot;read the book again&quot;. The information isn't that bad, it's the professor. He makes it hard."
6604,2309475,5.0,4.0,In my opinion probably one of the best teachers at the school. He makes you work for the grade that you get but he also teaches the information very well and his class is enjoyable
6605,1449318,5.0,1.0,I enjoyed her class even though I find plant bio somewhat boring. She gives all info needed to do well on her tests and she is generous on giving extra credit:)
6606,1449318,1.0,5.0,WORST teacher I have ever had. Her email responses are SUPER rude. She will not talk to you if you do not address her as Dr. Reichert. Her tests are pretty impossible. She curves to save herself from getting questioned by the college. The questions are not from notes or the required readings. Absolutely AVOID her if possible.
6607,1449318,1.0,4.0,This lady is so rude. If you email her you will get a passive aggressive comment if she replies at all. Tom holder was the lab teacher and he was the same way. Avoid these two teachers at all possibilities. The tests are hard and I feel like she pulls the questions out of thin air. Neither teachers are compassionate about this pandemic.
6608,1449318,1.0,5.0,"Nancy's lectures are very boring. Her notes rarely make any sense. She uses images that are hard to understand and see. Her test are very difficult. She has every type of question on the test (true false, multiple choice, matching, multiple answer, fill in the blank) She is by far the worst teacher I've ever had at Mississippi state. DO NOT TAKE!!!"
6609,1449318,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Reichert was a very difficult professor for a lower level bio class. I ended up with an A in the class but had to work very hard for it, and it took time out of preparing for other classes I found more important for my major. Her exams included multiple choice, T/F, multiple answer, and short answer. Overall a pretty difficult class."
6610,1449318,1.0,5.0,"She was one of the WORST professors I've had. She use to teach plant anat. (4000 level class) &amp; all of her plant anatomy kids did fine in the class bc it was the SAME material. Avoid her at all costs. She adds blanks to almost every lecture slide as well. Her tests are T/F, multiple choice, multiple answer, free response, diagraming, + some. RUDE."
6611,1449318,1.0,5.0,didnt like this teacher her class was harder than people told me it was with other teachers. she only gave grades for our tests and they were all really hard and screwed up my grade big time. probably wouldnt take another class from her
6612,1449318,3.0,4.0,"The tests are a mix of question types. After the first exam, she asked us what she could do to make them easier, we told her less true and false and on the next one, there were less. This is a hard class only because it is a hard subject. This is not a study right before the exam kind of class. There are a few bonus point quizzes of 1-5 points."
6613,1449318,1.0,5.0,Do not take her class. She has been known to be rude to students. Her tests are extremely hard &amp; she refuses to give any other grades besides tests. She has asked what she can do to help us &amp; after many suggestions from students she responded by saying she will not make changes. She is an awful teacher &amp; makes the class way harder than it should be
6614,2481516,5.0,2.0,Dr. Grace is amazing! Grades only consist of 5 tests but if you have less than 3 absences she will raise grade by 2 percent. Test questions come straight from notes so study those and you'll be fine!
6615,2391412,1.0,2.0,He is not organized and doesnt belong in a classroom setting. He is experienced in Television but had no idea how to teach it.
6616,2391412,5.0,2.0,"To start off, I have generalized anxiety. I went through the disability services here at MSU. For speech the only accommodation was him considering my anxiety whenever I gave a speech. I took this class in the summer before freshman year to get it out of the way. I am SO glad I did! If you are scared of this class take Hibbs! He is such a kind soul"
6617,2391412,4.0,3.0,"Jason is a really nice guy, I really enjoyed his class. One thing to note is he will come across like someone you can take advantage of- if you try, you will fail. He knows what he's doing, expects you to learn from your mistakes, and will require you to commit to what you say. Tardiness is not acceptable. All this said, he makes class enjoyable."
6618,1310069,1.0,4.0,Terrible teacher. Worst I've ever had and I've been taking Spanish since 4th grade. Doesn't know how to teach at all and thinks he can just repeat what he said louder so you understand it. I hated him he doesn't know how to let the student understand
6619,1310069,5.0,5.0,Dr. Espinosa is the best professor that this university ever had. He is real Spanish professor who can teach all the courses with perfection.  I had the honor to take four classes with Dr. Espinosa and I learned a lot in each class! IF YOU WANT TO LEARN SPANISH AND DISCIPLINE HE IS THE RIGHT ONE!
6620,1310069,1.0,5.0,"I don't know how he is still teaching. He thinks that if a student doesn't understand him, he needs to repeat the question (in Spanish) louder and meaner. Barely anyone understood him, and he made a girl in our class cry several times. I hated this class, and disliked this instructor."
6621,1760637,4.5,1.0,"Ms. Brown was a great teacher! Her notes were understandable, she never spoke in a monotone voice, and she tried to involve the class when she could. Lots of XC. Each week there's an assignment from the book, but she gives them out at the start of the semester(I did mine all at the same time and turned them in as needed). Tests are quick and easy."
6622,1760637,4.5,2.0,Great teacher. Very enthusiastic and knows material well. Very approachable and understanding.
6623,1760637,4.5,3.0,Ms Brown is very enthusiastic and open to feedback from the class.
6624,1858944,4.0,3.0,"If you actually pay attention in class and study well, her tests are not difficult. She gives note sheets for every class. If you answer every question and use it to study you'll be golden."
6625,1858944,1.0,4.0,"I feel like she should do more with graduate students. There were so many group projects that it was overwhelming! Even being in the class was stressful! I was told to take this class because it was a great environment and a good learning experience, but with her, I felt like I was stressed for a whole four months straight!"
6626,1858944,1.0,5.0,The worst professor I've come across. Swore to never take her again. I cannot even begin to describe how terrible she is.
6627,1858944,1.0,4.0,Not worth taking her!!!!
6628,1858944,1.0,4.0,Very difficult class for freshman just starting recommend taking junior or senior year
6629,1858944,5.0,4.0,"learned a lot, and worked hard for it"
6630,1858944,5.0,4.0,"This woman is a genius and really knows her stuff. She will make you work for your grade, that's true, but I feel like I learned so much in her class that it changed my worldview completely. She gives lots of opportunities for extra credit and does drop grades too. She and the TA respond to emails fast and even Twitter dms. Would recommend 100%"
6631,1858944,1.0,5.0,"Do NOT take this professor. She makes class so much harder than it has to be. I always make good grades in my classes, but I had a D in her class. She is the perfect example of how a professor can be the reason you do not succeed. EVERYTHING is graded so hard, even little take home assignments, and her tests are very unfair. STAY AWAY."
6632,1858944,1.0,5.0,Her test questions don't come from her lectures in class or from the book so studying is near impossible. Her TA grades everything and the class gets to grade each other. Her lectures are hard to follow and she doesn't have an email to ask questions. You must twitter DM her or talk to her in class. Do not recommend at all.
6633,1858944,1.0,5.0,"Her lecture slides are very vague so you have to take notes of what she is saying, and she talks very fast and takes the long way to answer a simple question. The book has nothing to do with the lectures and test are extremely difficult. do not reccomend"
6634,1858944,1.0,5.0,"This class is nothing like she makes it out to be, she rambles all class long on her prezzi slides but her tests are like 95% from the book, so basically you teach yourself. She also lets her TA grade everything off a weird rubric and counts off for grammar. She makes jokes in class that no one finds funny and it is very awkward. I do not recommend"
6635,1858944,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this professor unless you enjoy being lectured the whole class and not tested on any of the information you're lectured on. The group projects do not help at all and are just awkward. Her TA grades all the take home work which is graded from a weird rubric. Grammar matters, the other students are a part of your grade too. Not worth it."
6636,1858944,4.0,4.0,"I love this woman. She is tough, but you can really tell she knows her stuff. I thought she was very opinionated, but respectful of others opinions. I would definitely take her again. She does a good bit of take home assignments to help boost your grade, and she is surprisingly interactive for a college professor!"
6637,1858944,3.0,5.0,She's nice. Very hard though.
6638,1858944,2.0,4.0,She has a very smart mouth. It almost gets to the point where you don't want to sit in her class or ask her questions because you know she will have something smart to say. Don't take her if you want to ask questions. She moves at the speed of light and is sarcastic or rude if you do ask something.
6639,1932680,5.0,2.0,Super easy class. He posts the notes online but you still have to show up because attendance counts. He gives you study guides for the tests and usually has a review day the class before the tests. Tests are pretty straight forward. There is homework including quizzes that are easy to pass if you have a book and three very short projects.
6640,1932680,3.5,3.0,"Has multiple reading quizzes. Test are somewhat challenging, does a lot of group questions during class. Has a game that lets him know whose there , and who isn't. Please go to class if you want a good grade. PLEASE go to optional class you don't understand homework given, he helps very very efficiently. "
6641,2669966,3.0,2.0,"Professor Davenport has a great personality and really wants to see her students do well. I definitely didn't learn the most in her class, but she was hilarious to listen to during lecture and flexible with due dates and grades. Probably the easiest A I've ever gotten, just do the reading like you're supposed to and you'll be fine!"
6642,2669966,5.0,4.0,"She's pretty good. Her grading (and by her, I mean her TAs) can be kinda hard, but she tries to make lectures interesting &amp; will work with you. I enjoyed the class, but it did require a bit of work &amp; a LOT of reading. Honestly, she's chill and a solid choice if you're willing to put in the work. Two assignments every week &amp; she does do extra credit"
6643,2293135,4.0,4.0,"I was with Ms. Merzamie last winter in both reading and culture classes. First of all, Ms. Merzamie was very respectful to all the students, and she was also fair and transparent to us. She utilized the textbooks quite well and explained to us how to take the best advantage of it. She also shared her personal experience to encourage us. I like her"
6644,2293135,1.0,5.0,"When she sends emails, they are practically novels! And she makes mistakes in the emails which make them confusing to understand, and she makes Comp I WAY harder than it needs to be! I had 6 friends try to peer edit an outline for me and none of them knew how to help because they were so confused."
6645,2432409,4.0,2.0,"Jake is a pretty good lecturer. He's able to communicate all the information effectively. Because the class was so lecture-heavy, it was easy to zone out, but overall he did a great job. His exams were easy and his reviews were thorough. As long as you do the lab section well, it's an easy grade."
6646,2432409,2.0,4.0,"Professor Wiley's class was far more difficult than I expected. It is straight lecture and tests. The test are based off powerpoints, but super in depth and a lot to study for. I did not do good on the tests at all, and I did way better on the lab."
6647,2432409,2.0,4.0,I would not take this class if it isn't related to your major. Pretty in-depth class for being a freshman course. Labs are pretty difficult and ask for a lot in your answers.
6648,2432409,5.0,3.0,Just dont act up. He will embarrass you. And do NOT BE LATE.
6649,2432409,4.0,2.0,"He's a great teacher with an interesting lecture. He cares about his students and is enthusiastic about the topic. Don't need to go to class, but he offers extra credit if you do. Tests can be kinda tricky but generally straightforward."
6650,2432409,4.0,3.0,"He seems like a super chill genuine guy. His class is strictly lecturing, so it can get boring at times, but he really knows his stuff. The only grades come from tests and map quizzes. The map quizzes are super easy and can help your grade, but some of the tests were a little difficult. He's also super considerate about bonus points."
6651,2432409,4.0,2.0,"Mr. Wiley's a good choice if you want an easy international elective. Your grades come from quizzes and tests. They're all fairly easy. As far as class goes, he uses PowerPoints, but he posts them online, too. We did not need the book he listed in the syllabus. Overall, very easy."
6652,2432409,4.0,4.0,"Hes new so still learning. Tests are hard, but hes really generous about giving extra points and such. He also doesnt freak out when you dont come to class which is very nice. Super chill professor. No outside assignments except for online map quizzes which help your grade."
6653,2071983,1.0,5.0,"Christopher will miss class, come late every day, and will talk about everything except what we have due. Yeah he might be a nice person but we as students need to learn and have time to do our assignments, especially in another language!!!"
6654,2071983,4.0,3.0,"Chris is a laid back teacher. I am a Distance Learning Student and he responded to every email withing a couple of hours even on Sunday's. There is a lot of homework, but If you do you homework and do the tests like he tells you you can make a good grade. The only thing I did not like was we had partners, but he was flexible about it."
6655,671169,3.5,2.0,"I had Sneed for English Comp II and although the class is not hard, she seems very lost and confused about everything; therefore, everyone else is too. We don't really learn too much and she is tough at grading papers. The highest grade in my class was a high 80 and most people (like 95 percent of the class) had a 70 to mid 70 on their stuff."
6656,671169,4.5,1.0,"Sneed can be a pretty cool lady if you get her to talking about something besides writing. She will tear you up on comma errors, but if you can write a half decent essay her class is a breeze."

6659,2522573,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER! She consistently adds assignments that aren't on the syllabus, then claims they are. Be ready to listen and follow directions to the T! If you don't, you will fail. It's impossible to make an A in the course even by doing everything correctly."
6660,2522573,1.0,5.0,"She doesn’t respond to emails and when she does, she’s super aggressive towards all students. Repeatedly added and changed assignments without telling students and would say they were on the syllabus when they weren’t. "
6661,2522573,2.0,3.0,"If you take her class, get ready for unexpected assignments. essay rubric says that a B is following all instructions and writing a good paper. A is going beyond. It is impossible to make an A. counts off points left and right with little feedback. Better participate in class. that's a big grade. even if you do, she'll still prob give a bad grade"
6662,2522573,2.0,3.0,"After a few classes, I realized how condescending she was. She is not really supportive of her students, and she even pits us against each other. During discussion, one student raised a question, and Dr. Ward immediately said, &quot;All right, let's see if next student can do better.&quot; I don't really feel comfortable sharing in class."
6663,2522573,1.0,3.0,"I would recommend avoiding this professor at all costs. She is extremely rude and condescending towards her students. Even admitted to our class that she hates teaching. We don't even have a real syllabus, so for students who like to plan out their semester... good luck."
6664,900560,4.0,5.0,"I love her humor!! If you read the poems and stories, youll do good on her quizzes. Her testing method is relatively straightforward."
6665,900560,4.0,4.0,I took this as an Honors class. Be prepared to do a lot of reading. Weekly quizzes and discussion posts. A few 2-page reading responses. Dr. Johnson is very enthusiastic about this class. She grades pretty easily as long as she can tell you put in effort to the assignment.
6666,900560,5.0,3.0,One of my favorite teachers by far! She is so witty and encouraging! Her classes are always full of jokes and a love for what she teaches. I have taken two of her classes and loved both of them. British Lit and Chaucer. She is so accommodating and helpful. She gives an actual typed letter in feedback after your papers are graded. Love her classes!
6667,900560,5.0,2.0,"A great lecturer who truly cared about her students and subject. She loves the literature and hopes to instill this same love in her students. Gives a lot of reading assignments and daily quizzes, but the readings are easy. She loves it when you go to her office hours for help, and your grade reflects if you get her feedback. I loved her class!!"
6668,900560,5.0,4.0,"I love her! She is super enthusiastic about what she does. Her quizzes are hard, but she gives a lot of extra credit. For your papers MAKE SURE you go to office hours. She is extremely helpful during office hours and will give you specific things that you need to fix."
6669,900560,5.0,4.0,I absolutely loved her and her class. She makes the literature so enjoyable and she is so helpful. Really appreciates and encourages you to go to her office. Grades super fair. 3-4 papers and 3 exams. Exams are long but were never hard as long as you understood the material. I absolutely loved her and her class. Super helpful with anything you need
6670,900560,4.0,3.0,"She is so passionate about what she is teaching and gets very excited about it which makes her class really engaging. Because she makes it so interesting, I was really well prepared for all of my exams without too much studying. She is also very very helpful during office hours regarding papers."
6671,900560,3.0,3.0,"Honestly, I loved Johnson at first. She is funny and loves her work (mainly Medieval lit). I enjoyed her class thoroughly, but she did not like me and my end grade reflected that. I argued with her reading of the text and was punished for doing so. (My test and paper grades were all 85+.) I would not take her again."
6672,900560,4.0,4.0,"Mrs. Johnson is very enthusiastic about English and since there were only 12 people in my class she expected all of us to feel the same about it.  She makes you read and write a lot and she grades pretty tough.  She will be brutally honest when you go to her office hours.  However, she is very willing to help.  "
6673,900560,4.0,5.0,She's a lot of fun but the class is really touch. She grades extremely hard but she's willing to help revise your papers. Lots of writing!!! And definitely go to class b/c your final grade will be affected by attendance.
6674,900560,4.5,4.0,"English has always been one of my favorite subjects; writing comes naturally. This class is for people who are interested in the subject. Dr. Johnson is naturally enthusiastic and knows her subject well. A tough class. I would take a class with her again, if I could. Only one warning - &quot;eccentric&quot; opinions may not make for great papers."
6675,900560,4.5,4.0,She is a great teacher. she makes the class very interesting. she will make you write a good number of papers but she will help you whenever you need it. she makes english fun. i'd take her again if i could
6676,900560,2.0,4.0,I hate everything to do with Lit and she expects everyone to love it or grow to love it as much as she does. Not worth taking I promise
6677,900560,4.5,4.0,She expected us to know a couple of quotes out of like fifty stories but here is the thing she did not tell us which stories they were coming from.
6678,900560,5.0,3.0,"She was very helpful when I was doing papers for her class and is still helpful even though I'm no longer writing papers for her. Knows and likes what she is talking about. A bit paper-heavy, but worth it."
6679,900560,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Johnson loves what she teaches. She is very animated, which could get annoying if you have her early in the morning or something, but she makes it clear that she loves what she does and she wants you to like it, too. Her class is a challenge; she has you reading a lot (but not excessively), writing papers, and gives pop quizzes. She will call o"
6680,2825681,4.0,5.0,"Personally I think the lectures he gave supplemented the textbook material excellently; he explained concepts very well in my opinion and how to do the appropriate journal entries w/ them. The material can be boring at times but youll do well if you know how to do the journal entries. He also told us a lot of dad jokes, pretty funny guy."
6681,2825681,1.0,5.0,He is awful and does a awful job at teaching
6682,2825681,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE, DOES NOT HELP ANYONE IN CLASS. THE WORST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN, DOES NOT GIVE CLEAR STUDY GUIDES OR HELP WITH TEST. "
6683,2825681,1.0,4.0,Kyle was overall horrible. One of the worst class experiences I have ever delt with as a junior here at Mississippi State University. 
6684,2833887,5.0,1.0,Super easy class plus she doesn't hold class on Friday. Very nice too.
6685,2416096,5.0,3.0,"Super simple and very kind professor. Just pay attention and complete the assignments, you should get a good overall grade. If you do need help in the class, just let her know, and she will try her best to help you out. Exams are also not exceedingly difficult just go over your notes beforehand."
6686,2416096,1.0,4.0,"Just dont, gives out the most unnecessary projects and grades them pretty tough. Pop quizzes and extremely unclear, vague instructions"
6687,2416096,1.0,5.0,The most unprofessional professor Ive ever had. She still hasnt graded homework that she assigned half way through the semester. Pop quizzes that the beginning of class that were over stuff she had not lectured on. Tests were insane. 0/10 recommend.
6688,2416096,1.0,3.0,Just don't. She's my current professor and also my advisor. You can never get a hold of her for ANYTHING unless it's a meeting she schedules. You will do the dumbest projects that take so much time and are literally just a hassle. I bought so many things to only use them once. Waste of money and waste of time. Plus don't expect clear guidelines....
6689,2743786,5.0,3.0,"She is a great professor and a great person. I normally dislike English courses but she made the class very engaging. You will write several papers about the topic of your choosing, so pick something that interests you. Go to class, she will flesh out her expectations and her grading for the papers. She gives less busy work then other English profs"
6690,2743786,5.0,4.0,I love Mrs Gill! She really cares about her students and was easy to reach anytime. I hate English but she made it not bad.
6691,2743786,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Gill was an amazing teacher to have in EN1113. The whole semester is basically about finding a topic and writing about that topic. There are 3 essays you need to write: exploratory, justification and researched argument. The last essay is worth 200 points and you have to present. "
6692,2743786,5.0,4.0,"Ms Gill is amazing. I hate English and writing but shes super nice. She makes it vv clear what you need to do to get a good grade and shes very easy to talk to. I got an A in this class. But you have to go to class. But her class isnt bad. She just talks about the requirements for the essay. Youll write 5 essays, but all EN classes require that"
6693,2743786,5.0,3.0,Ms Gill is such an organized and caring teacher. She is very clear about what she wants from us in our essays and provides very helpful resources to guide you. She does give daily assignments but they are pretty straightforward and come in pretty handy for your main essay submission. She gives extra credit for attending the writing center.
6694,2555384,5.0,2.0,"I find myself looking forward to her class. She's got great energy and is tons of fun. Topics can be heavy sometimes but always treated with respect. Lots of papers, the only problem is rubrics are super vague. I would take this class again if given the chance"
6695,2555384,2.0,1.0,"Good professor, but she got off topic every 5 minutes. This made it difficult to pay attention in class."
6696,2555384,2.0,4.0,"There are weekly quizzes that are easy. She says you need the book, but you don't. Every week there is a writing assignment that is a lot of work. These writing assignments lead to one big paper for the final. Her grading criteria & instructions for the assignments are vague. She does not respond to emails. Attendance is required. DO NOT TAKE HER!!"
6697,2555384,5.0,2.0,"Professor Layth was great. There were quite a few papers to write and quizzes to take, but she gave us plenty of time to write our papers and the quizzes had unlimited chances. The way her intro to soc. class is structured, the papers you write throughout the course will all help towards your final portfolio paper. "
6698,2555384,2.0,3.0,"&quot;All opinions matter and should be respected&quot; she says day 1 of class. As class goes on she continuously attacks certain groups of people without giving them fair judgment. We talked about why its horrible abortion is treated how it is, with no understanding of why people don't support abortion. This happens in every discussion about anything."
6699,2555384,5.0,2.0,"Professor Layth is by far the most engaging and interesting teacher I have ever had. I have learned so much in this class - and was even excited to go to lecture. She's amazing at delivering information, and the work so easy. The majority of class assignments surround a final portfolio paper, and the reading quiz answers can be found on quizlet"
6700,2555384,5.0,2.0,"Professor Layth was honestly one of my favorite professors I have had this semester. I had her for Contemporary Social Problems and it is by far the easiest class The class consist of reading quizzes, bi-weekly portfolio assignments, and a final paper. I If you just try you will be fine. She is not afraid to call you out or correct you! LOVE HER!"
6701,2555384,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this class if you want a good grade. She did not grade based on the rubric or syllabus. Also, she wont put your grades in until well over months after submitting. If you disagree with her, she will grade you more harshly. She does not email you back, so do not expect any help in this class"
6702,2555384,2.0,4.0,"Mrs. Layth is not the hardest professor Ive had, but most definitely not an easy one either. Lots of tedious assignments that take a long time to do. I would recommend a different professor for Intro to Sociology."
6703,2555384,5.0,2.0,I loved this class! Professor Layth made lectures fun and interesting and I don't recall a day where I dreaded going to class. I learned many things including how to be more open-minded. Assignments aren't hard but can be tedious at times. You should be good if you stay on top of things. Readings improve lecture and 'clicker' is mandatory.
6704,2637309,5.0,3.0,"Michael was my favorite professor freshman year. His class is very laid back and participation is fun. His class wont put you to sleep. His quizzes are super easy, just dont take advantage of them. The test can be a little harder if you dont study."
6705,2637309,5.0,3.0,Very good professor : gives great lectures and is easy to get in touch with. He cares about his students grades.
6706,2244131,5.0,4.0,"Took Quest 1 with Dr. Vivier and I can honestly say it's the best class experience I've ever had.  It requires a lot of work, but if you put in the effort it will pay off!!  Class participation is a grade, but if he knows you're trying he'll cushion your weekly quiz grade.  Very fair grader for papers (course has four total) as well."
6707,2244131,5.0,3.0,"Could not recommend Dr. Vivier enough! His style of teaching is so enjoyable and you really learn from his class. He gives amazing feedback on papers and will reward effort even if you're wrong. Readings are long, but what you get out of the in-class discussions makes it worth it. Genuinely one of the best professors I've had at MSU. Take him!!"
6708,2244131,5.0,3.0,"A professor who's fair and straightforward, with clear expectations at the beginning of the year. He gives reading quizzes every class (which aren't hard if you've actually read). Easy to work with, happy to help you succeed, great feedback on papers, and interesting lectures. Definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken in my degree!"
6709,2244131,3.0,4.0,"This class is interesting. However, it does require A LOT of reading. Make sure you have room in your schedule to read texts for this class."
6710,2244131,4.0,4.0,"Taking Dr. Viviers Quest II class is very eye-opening. I really appreciated how he didnt judge what you say. We did read up to 2 books per week, so if you dont like reading I wouldnt recommend this class."
6711,2244131,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Viver is very fun, but this class is a lot of work. You will end up reading half of a book for the first class of the week and the rest for the second class. It is a rewarding class because you get to interact with your peers but it caused a lot of unnecessary stress for my 1st semester. He is a great guy but think about your load before taking"
6712,2244131,3.0,5.0,"For Dr. Vivier, it was hard to please him in a general sense with any writing I did during his class. I would go to his office hours during every paper, leave confident, and then end up with a B every time without any idea why. He would compliment it, say I've improved, but his criticism would be too harsh and not helpful in what I need to improve."
6713,2244131,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've had at State. The class was interesting, and he did a great job leading the class discussions. Really good at making you think deeply about what you're reading, and very easy to talk to. The class wasn't difficult by any means, but it's actually an enjoyable class and if you do the work you're going to get a lot out of it."
6714,2244131,3.0,5.0,"Literally one of the hardest things I've ever done. Going to office hours for paper is key, but just know that even if you leave his office feeling perfect about your paper, it probably isn't. He is very particular about what he wants."
6715,2244131,5.0,4.0,"If you are motivated and care about the material in the class then Dr. Vivier is a fantastic professor. Many of his courses are seminar-style and class participation/doing the reading matters. Not heavy on the lectures. Fun to be in class with, and gives great constructive criticism."
6716,2244131,5.0,5.0,Dr. Vivier is a tough but fair professor. He does a great job of facilitating class discussion and making people think. He also gives really good feedback on papers. Just dont expect a high A. Absolutely would recommend.
6717,2244131,5.0,4.0,"This class is hard but worth it. The amount of reading is inhuman and slightly miserable, but the in class discussions make it absolutely worth it. You really bond with your classmates and think new thoughts. Extremely helpful in office hours. He will grade your papers super super harshly but it it worth it"
6718,2244131,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Vivier makes you read an almost unreasonable amount, but his class is such a rewarding experience. When you leave his class, your writing and critical thinking skills will be vastly improved and you will be better prepared to defend and express your ideas. I highly recommend his Quest class for any major."
6719,2244131,5.0,3.0,"Amazing Professor! If you have the chance, TAKE THIS MAN"
6720,2801193,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Qiao (got his PhD about a month ago) is one of the nicest profs I've ever met! His class is very fair, and you will be prepared for the tests if you work all of the review problems. Go to his office hours for help."
6721,1998393,1.5,5.0,"From his lack of examples of problems, when I say lack I mean none at all, to his lack of skill in English, he would have issues reading his own slides, I eventually quit going. It was easier to teach the material to myself than to listen to him ramble on about nothing useful. However, he is the only teacher that teaches this class. Good Luck!"
6722,1285689,1.0,4.0,"This professor does not consider other students opinions and is very rude.  She acts as if this is middle school with not letting students use the bathroom, or having to leave early.  Would make students late to next class due to ""her class being more important"".  The professor would continuously argue with students based on their opinions.  "
6723,1285689,1.0,5.0,"You have to agree with her opinions or she will scream at you, put you down,  make you feel stupid, and make you never want to speak again in class. The reading quizzes are on the most random things in the readings, so pay attention to non important details. Be prepared to stay late as well, don't schedule a class right after or you wont make it."
6724,1285689,3.0,4.0,Dont like her very much. Her assignments are complicated and dont have much use in the long run.
6725,1285689,1.0,4.0,"The worst professor I have ever had to deal with. Not specific about assignments, her lectures do not correlate at all with class work, and gives assignments that have little to nothing to do with literature. She does not explain assignments clearly in class and do not be surprised if you see something on canvas due that she has not even mentioned."
6726,1285689,4.0,4.0,"My experience is probably different from a normal class because of Covid-19, but I loved this class. Grading was heavily based on writing, but there were only two papers the entire semester. She was avaliable to talk you through the writing process. There were no deductions for late work and was often very willing to extend deadlines if you asked."
6727,1285689,3.0,5.0,"If you want a semi decent grade in this class, GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS and participate in class. Im typically a straight A student, but it was impossible for me in this class. Dont disagree with her opinions and if youre writing on a topic, make sure she agrees with it. If you take her, good luck."
6728,1285689,3.5,3.0,"Her lectured are long and she sometimes goes over time, but she is very clear about what she wants you to know. Her tests are long and can be challenging, but if you read and study then you should be fine. You HAVE to do your readings and participation is necessary. Class is boring unless you give her some conversational material."
6729,1285689,4.0,4.0,Oneil is very passionate about her work and is an expert in her field. She's written a lot of papers on early American Lit. She wants you to read a lot but if you do that then class is awesome. Just a lot of discussion. Tests are fair but she is hard on papers. She teaches the writing class tho so  If you are in the major youll have her again.
6730,1285689,1.5,5.0,"Dr. O'Neill does know what she is talking about and she is passionate about it. The problem is that this class seems to be too much about opinions, interpretations, and speculations about the text than what is actually in the text. Her essay instructions were not entirely clear. I strongly recommend that you do not take this professor."
6731,1285689,1.0,5.0,"I recieved A's and B's in all other english composition classes.  However, in this American Literature class she focused more on composition than literature itself.  She does not spend enough time on one story and proceeds on to the next leaving her students clueless.  If you are smart you will not take this professor."
6732,1285699,5.0,1.0,"I took him for Psych. of Mental Retardation. I LOVED him! He uses overheads/transparencies for notes. Not a ton of notes, but covers the important parts. I bought the book, but have not opened it. Not needed if you attend class. He gives you 5 absences before it affects your grade. Very funny and super easy to talk to/ask questions. Loved him!"
6733,1285699,5.0,1.0,Great guy. I've never laughed so much. I learned a lot from him. Super nice and knows his stuff. Uses overheads exclusively- take good notes and you don't need the book. He tests from notes. Watch for some &quot;trick&quot; test questions. LOVED HIM!
6734,2457163,1.0,4.0,"THE Worst teacher I have ever had. I have taken 3 different classes with him and can confidently assure you that I learned nothing. His lectures are very dull. Don't be afraid to take in your graded test and argue with him, I got points back every time. If you can avoid taking his class DO. Tests are open note tho- only reason I survived."
6735,2457163,1.0,3.0,Had zero clue what he was teaching. Gave &quot;random feedback&quot; as he said which was more confusing rather than helpful and in general didnt care about the class. By far one of the worst professors i have ever had.
6736,2457163,1.0,2.0,"The TA's for this course are tough graders. One problem was worth 30 points, and I lost 20 points for one wrong number. I basically shouldn't have done the problem... They give homework and tests back fast, but they grade veeerrrryyyy hard. In lectures, it's hard to hear the teacher. Yes, he has good English; he just speaks low ."
6737,2457163,1.0,3.0,"All homework is graded by TA's with little to no feedback. Lecture notes are sped through. Just writes down the answers on slides instead of showing work, which are sometimes incorrect &amp; only pointed out if someone in class has time to work the problem before he moves on to the next slide. BUT he offered a 7pt extra credit to overall final grade!"
6738,2457163,1.0,5.0,"Very unclear accent, tough to understand the way he teaches. Doesn't provide clear instructions on assignments. Looks kinda frustrated when someone asks a question. Doesn't clarifies context much. You have to do all the work."
6739,1941068,1.0,1.0,"Yeah I have nothing good to say here. If you want to teach yourself, take her class. "
6740,1941068,1.0,1.0,Lol she is a clown. Do NOT take her. 
6741,1941068,4.0,3.0,I took Principles of Microeconomics online with Professor Aleman and it was pretty easy. Her instructions were very clear and she gave multiple attempts on homeworks and quizzes. Test questions were very similar to the homeworks and quizzes. A lot of the test questions and all of the hw/quiz questions could be found on quizlet as well.
6742,1941068,1.0,3.0,"This is not PE. No we do not need to do jumping jacks. It's 9:30 am we are tired, let us be tired."
6743,1941068,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Orozco is not a very good teacher.  While she does work plenty of examples during class, she does not clearly communicate expectations for the exam and her grading methods are very opaque.  I would avoid her if possible, but she is the only professor who teaches this class.  I would suggest trying to get it during the summer."
6744,1941068,1.5,4.0,She is the worst teacher I have ever taken. It is hard to understand what she is saying and she is completely unorganized in her lessons. She does not explain the material and it is hard to ask for help from a teacher that can barely comprehend what you are asking her. HATED THIS CLASS!! Read the book and teach yourself. Prof. Aleman is HORRIBLE.
6745,2203220,4.0,4.0,"I think hes a good teacher. Tests arent too bad, seem to be fairly like the study guide. Be sure to study study guide very well to do well on exams. Make sure to do the connect assignments. I dont find this class too bad so far"
6746,2203220,4.0,4.0,"Dr. McLarty is a great guy! He loves the subject and tries to make classes fun. He's good about responding and answering students' questions during the class. Go to class, and you should pass. By far, the easiest and most caring professor of Management at State."
6747,2203220,2.0,3.0,"Beware, test questions are very specific, and he gives no guidance on test prep. Compared to Hammond, McLarty is much tougher. There will be a lot of assignments due through SmartBook lesson (130$) and blackboard. Daily participation is graded. He gives a lot of extra credit but don't count on it to get an A. Take Hammond if you can."
6748,2203220,4.0,2.0,Not a bad choice as a teacher. Gives a ton of extra credit. If you come to class you will not fail!
6749,2203220,3.0,3.0,"He is very boring and over explains everything. The optional study guides are super long, but they are helpful for the tests. He is quick to grade homework and tests."
6750,2203220,1.0,1.0,This professor will typically keep you until the last second. Tends to over explain things that are very simple. If you like reading only from a power point and filling in blanks for two hours this is the class for you.
6751,2203220,1.0,2.0,He's an extremely boring professor who feels the need to overexplain everything.
6752,2203220,3.0,3.0,"A decent teacher, but he tends to over explain everything"
6753,2203220,1.0,3.0,This guy is a complete mess as a teacher. He's the kind of teacher that'll make attendance 1/6th of your grade and then make you fall asleep by spending twenty minutes explaining a Dilbert comic. He's also the kind of professor to put an exam the week before finals and then make a cumulative final. Only take this guy if you have no choice.
6754,1801826,4.5,4.0,I really like this teacher. She is nice and she's really helpful and easy to learn from. She understands that none of us understand French yet and she's there to teach us. The only complaint is that she moves a little quickly for my taste and she's a really REALLY strict grader. But overall a really good teacher if you study.
6755,1490533,5.0,3.0,"I loved taking Professor Austin! He is super funny, makes learning the material easy, and is understanding. I would definitely take him again! Text books are required and make sure you do your readings before class, as long as you put the effort in, you'll pass."
6756,1490533,5.0,3.0,"Austin is one of my favorite professors I've had here. He provides plenty of opportunities to excel in his class if you're willing to put in the bare minimum. There are 4 tests, 3 papers, and a research project. There are a few pop quizzes but they count towards bonuses on tests. He is understanding that English may not be for everyone."
6757,1490533,5.0,5.0,"Mr. Austin is a fantastic teacher. He knows what its like to be a student, so his class schedule is easy. At the tail end, the class periods are set aside for research for your research paper. He may be a tough grader, but he has conferences and clear grading criteria. Just put in your best effort and youll be fine."
6758,1490533,4.0,3.0,Tests were fair if you read the material. He wasn't trying to make anyone fail. You have to write two papers that have to be 3 pages long and one research paper that has to be 5 pages long. He is a pretty cool dude.
6759,1490533,4.0,3.0,"If you read the stories, poems, etc. the test are pretty easy. You have to write 2 papers that are 3 pages long and 1 research paper that is 5 pages long. He gives extra credit for going to the writing center before each paper which is a major plus. Also, random extra credit quizzes to see if you read the stories which help your test grades a lot."
6760,1490533,4.0,3.0,Attendance affects grade. We wrote 3 papers and 1 paper as a final. Class is easy just listen and talk about the assigned readings. Easy Grader.
6761,1490533,1.0,3.0,"I did not like this professor at ALL. he was mean when I spoke to him and incredibly demeaning. When I came in to retake a test, 40 minutes in he asked me if I was done yet because I was taking way longer than everyone else to finish. He always had smart a** comments about people and was short with almost everyone."
6762,1490533,4.0,3.0,"Super helpful in the lead up to papers and gives good feedback during conferences. When you go to conferences, have as much of your paper done as possible so he can give you the most feedback. He's a really funny guy and tries to make Comp 2 as painless as possible."
6763,1490533,5.0,2.0,"Not only is Prof. Austin great, but the class is super easy. You will read every class and he gives quizzes on the reading material which are easy if you read. You have 3 essays and your final is a presentation which is also easy. He does take attendance for a grade so make sure to attend and to always read the material and you will pass!"
6764,1490533,1.0,4.0,"Daniel Austin is an ok teacher at best, as a person, he is awful. He openly makes fun of his students and hazes them. He will do everything in his power to publicly embarrass you in front of the whole class. I recommend staying at least 10 feet away from this man."
6765,1490533,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher, and hes very hilarious. Highly recommend."
6766,1490533,2.0,4.0,I took this class with a friend. She frequently asked questions to make sure she was following instructions and was very rude. SHE later apologized in an email and he did not even respond. He talks a lot about his personal life and his own school work (he is still a student himself) to the point where it's super annoying. Do not recommend.
6767,1490533,4.0,2.0,Had him for Acc Comp II. Everything he goes over in lecture is not important for you to pass the class but he does make class interesting. Ended with an A even though Im not the best at writing. Just show up to class and participate and he will be less strict with you. Offered extra credit for going to the writing center. Easy A and do recommend.
6768,1490533,4.5,2.0,"Mr. Austin is hands down the best english teacher I have had. Not only is he hilarious, but he is here to help. He truly wants his classes to be interesting and everyone, regardless of their major, seem to be interested. I love this class and would recommend it to anyone."
6769,1490533,2.5,3.0,"He is very one sided and if you do not think the same way he does, you're wrong. I would not recommend taking him for english. He is also very bad a playing favorites. "
6770,1490533,2.0,5.0,"Mr. Austin thinks highly of himself. He demeans the students making sure you know he is better than you and always will be. Do not expect a 100 on anything because no one is perfect and can not make a 100 in his class, according to him. I would no recommend him"
6771,1490533,4.0,3.0,"Really nice guy and easy to get off subject.  His grading though is a bit harder than the other Comp 1 professors I've heard of.  He'll help you though if you ask and there's never going to be quizzes. Other than that it's just four papers.  If you're good at writing, he won't even care if you show up to class."
6772,1490533,4.0,1.0,"He was not hard, he made English reasonably interesting, and the work was fairly interesting.  I recieved a grade of above a 100% on all of the papers except for 1."
6773,1490533,3.0,4.0,He is not overly friendly or helpful. He grades hard but doesn't tell you how to fix it. Freshman should not take him.
6774,1490533,1.0,5.0,i have nothing to say
6775,1490533,5.0,2.0,"He's a really great teacher! If you need help he's very willing to do what it takes to help you, and if you don't need it, he isn't going to force you to pay attention when you don't need it. Overall he's an outstanding teacher"
6776,1490533,4.0,2.0,"Great teacher. He didn't make you do pointless things if you obviously understood the concept. It was a great class. I highly recommend him, especially if you're intelligent and don't want to sit through a boring class where you are expected to do mind-numbing tasks."
6777,2555506,1.0,5.0,Professor Chenoweth is absolutely terrible. He only gives test grades and there's no other assignments to help your grade. Each test covers ten plus lectures which is a lot of material for a history class. He claims that his tests are not meant to trick you but he will put a misspelled version of the correct answer to try to trick you.
6778,2555506,1.0,5.0,"Richard Chenoweth is arguably the worst studio critic I've ever had. After not receiving any comments on my final grade, I learn that his favorites in the class all made close to 100%. The only feedback I got from him was my work was 'mediocre at best'. This man is despicable and you should fight to get out of his section if you get him."
6779,1089140,5.0,1.0,"This is definitely one of the sweetest, most fun, and care-free teachers I have ever had.  She is so helpful, kind, and very energetic.  She loves what she does and makes everything very clear.  TAKE HER if you get the chance."
6780,1089140,5.0,1.0,"Took the night class and it is AWESOME, would definitely recommend, even as a night class. We never stay the full 3 hours anyway. A lot of online homework- have to buy the book to get access"
6781,1089140,5.0,1.0,Ms. Cain is fun and super easy! The book is definitely NOT required. Her tests come straight from her notes in class and the final is really easy too. The hardest part of this class is the final speech. Overprepare yourself for it! Practice!
6782,1089140,5.0,1.0,"I have taken two of her classes.  She is the most amazing teacher, always positive, and very helpful.  I would recommend taking her for any classes that she teaches."
6783,1089140,5.0,2.0,"Perfect teacher to have in your incoming freshman year. Laid back, makes you feel comfortable, but grades fairly. Really cool teacher... Go over too much on your time limit, though, and you might be screwed."
6784,2801284,5.0,2.0,Words cannot express how amazing this instructor is. I have never seen such perfect handwriting or crystal-clear explanations of difficult problems or concepts. On top of this he is incredibly caring and down to earth who looks for unique ways to give partial credit. Easly the best instructor in the enter EM department. #Chris Duncan fan for life
6785,2653829,5.0,2.0,Professor Cagle is really nice and funny. His exams can be quite long but if you attend sections with your TA you should be set because they'll help you review for exams and go into more depth on topics so you can give good answers on the essay questions. Highly recommend this class for international students.
6786,2653829,5.0,3.0,"Easy, nice and caring professor. Very down to earth, willing to discuss grades. Attendance isnt super required, you can use lecture slides to asnwer his quizes. Solid professor overall."
6787,130705,5.0,3.0,Dr. McGrath was an awesome professor! He is kind and caring and a wonderful mentor. He always had a smile on his face and brightened the room with his fun sense of humor. He would go out of his way for his students and other faculty. Im thankful to have had him as part of my educational pathway.
6788,130705,1.0,5.0,"Once again, a horrible experience.  Making graduate students answer 'chapter questions' from the reading is ridiculous.  He complains that studetns do not read -- so raise the GRE score requirements not making us do this garbage.  This was Ed. Philosophies but he spends his time talking about breast feeding instead.  Waste of time."
6789,130705,3.5,3.0,"Class is not hard...just so much work that you can never keep up.  I have never had to do so much work in a 10-week time period.  As long as you do the work, you pass.  I thought it was ridiculous to make us tell the page numbers that vocabulary words were used on, though."
6790,130705,1.0,2.0,No Comments
6791,130705,5.0,3.0,Very nice guy
6792,1851027,4.0,2.0,"Take her at 8 AM. It is awful, but she is much more lenient; usually walks in late so doesn't care if you do, too. Grades easy."
6793,2752167,1.0,4.0,Not a good teacher. You can try your hardest on the essays and still barely pass them
6794,2752167,1.0,5.0,Go ahead. Put every ounce of effort you can muster into writing that paper. You're not getting above a B.
6795,745130,5.0,4.0,Attractive and intelligent with knowledge of language and writing skills and how to use them as a profession.
6796,745130,5.0,1.0,SHE IS REALLY NICE AND EASY
6797,745130,5.0,4.0,"She is an excellent English teacher. If you listen to her advice, your work will improve."
6798,745130,5.0,4.0,GRAMMAR!!! she is tough but a really good teacher.  She stresses grammar and the technical side of writing but will help you out
6799,745130,3.5,4.0,No Comments
6800,1785519,1.0,5.0,"Study guides have nothing to do with the exams, assignments always have grammatical errors that you have to decipher on your own, and it takes her forever to grade assignments. Do yourself a favor and take someone else."
6801,1785519,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Nagel was not a good instructor. On the weekly homework, she would assign questions to answer. I would write the answers ahead of time because the quizzes were timed. However, when taking the quiz, I discovered that she changed the wording of some of the questions, so I would have to completely change my answer. Also, the tests were awful."
6802,1785519,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Nagel is a good person, however I hated her class, unfortunately she is the worst teacher I have taken classes with in the Geoscience department.She took too long to correct all the assignments, exams and quizzes, sometimes she took a month to correct. In addition, the exams are 60 min long, which is not enough for an exam of 40 multiple choice"
6803,1785519,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Nagel has a poor educational style. Her exam questions are poorly written, leaving out key words. We need to be able to trust that our professors have proofed their exams. I had to correct her answers, she actually did reverse the grades on a couple of those. She is a very slow grader, its hard to take exams when unit quizzes are not graded.  "
6804,1785519,1.0,5.0,She makes tons of grammar mistakes and holds you accountable for your mistakes. She takes 3-4 weeks to grade any assignment. She tells you an assignment will be graded by a certain date but its always later. She makes excuses for everything. Her exams are 1 question at a time and you can't go back and check them. She is very ambiguous on quizzes.  
6805,1785519,1.0,5.0,"Horrible. Questions on tests are never taught or explained in class. All random facts from the textbook that she never goes. Even with the tests being open book, questions are confusing and unfair and hard to know what the right answer is (even with all the materials right in front of you!!). There are always spelling errors. Avoid this professor. "
6806,1785519,2.0,5.0,"The absolute worst class I've ever taken. Each week, you have to create a map, not even knowing how the end product is supposed to look, so you just hope for the best. Then you don't know your grade for a while, bc it takes forever to be graded. The final was terrible. Several multiple choice questions had 8 choices, EIGHT! 67 Q's in 90 mins."
6807,1785519,1.0,4.0,"Uses video lectures from 2011. Lab directions riddled with mistakes AND not up to date with current version of software (ArcGIS). Slow to grade. Slow to no feedback on assignments, even when requested. Tests on material NOT covered in class or textbook. Mistakes in the tests. Nothing good to say here."
6808,1785519,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Nagel is a substandard instructor in this and other classes. She does not do any instructing herself. She assigns a significant amount of busywork and is very late to provide grading and feedback to assigned tasks. She does not provide a structured course for students who work full time to plan around, assignments are added at the last minute"
6809,1785519,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Gives good feedback and is open to feedback. She was a bit slow in grading but her online course had too many students, something that administrators should resolve. Definitely take her!"
6810,1785519,2.0,4.0,"Material is easy, weekly quizzes are unnecessarily difficult. Quizzes are multiple choice, my answers are straight from the book, I don't know where she gets her answers. Understanding the material must not be important, grades do not reflect your knowledge. Very slow grader, I'm in week 14 and just received week 3 grades. I will not take her again"
6811,1785519,1.0,4.0,"Although there was a lot of work it was manageable and not difficult but her grading did not always seem logical. I wish she referenced the textbook more on the homework. Also, I do not think she should be teaching. I felt that there was a lack of empathy with her and did not return my calls/emails about my assignment questions/issues."
6812,1785519,4.0,3.0,Nagel is a tough grader but is fair. Definitely needs to work on being more clear with the directions for assignments and expectations. Responds to emails relatively quickly although there is sometimes a huge delay.
6813,1785519,4.5,4.0,"I don't know what the person above is talking about but I wouldn't trust that review with all the typo's (that's how you type it). Also, I think they meant interpret, not interpolate? Anyway, she's a great teacher. You'll have to work but it's a fun class. Plus she has good jokes!"
6814,1785519,1.5,4.0,Tests difficult to interpolate.  Many questions within one question.  Lots of busy Work!  Directions for Labs inaccurate with many type O's and invalid numerical data which caused much confusion and frustration.
6815,1801906,4.5,4.0,Amazing professional who really helped me better understand student affairs
6816,2563770,5.0,4.0,Dr. Flow's class is entertaining yet nerve wracking if you don't like speaking up in front of classmates. His class involves a significant amount of reading and discussing. He gives quizzes on almost all of the assigned reading. He is accommodating. People were given the chance to earn an A regardless of whether they were outgoing or quiet/silent.
6817,2563770,5.0,2.0,I took Quest 1 with prof flow and loved it. He is super goofy but has so many inspiring ideas. You have to read A LOT for this class but its so worth it because of the amazing discussions. He gives quizzes sometimes about the reading but they are usually fairly general and you will do fine if you read. He gives difficult papers but grades easy.
6818,1957570,5.0,4.0,"Tim Moore is a great professor. People hate on him because of their grades on the first couple of tests. He is an engineer himself and doesn't want to produce lazy engineers. If you listen to him and truly learn the material, you will do fine in his class. He will either make you step up and become an engineer or pack your bags and go home."
6819,1957570,1.0,5.0,"I created an account just to rate Tim Moore. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Doesn't tell the class test averages, but after the first one half the class dropped out of 250 people. He said for every A there were 55 F's. It is a helpless cause and there is no light to be found. Will make you want to drop out of college because homelessness seems more appealing."
6820,1957570,1.0,5.0,Worst professor to walk the planet. Not clear AT ALL on grading guidelines and just wants to see kids suffer.
6821,1957570,3.0,4.0,"Timothy Moore can be a tough professor on most days. Some days Timothy Moore can be alright, and at least try to attempt a connection with his students. However, he grades extremely hard and will get extremely mad at his class for not doing great on his exams. He definitely shows his emotion too much in class sometimes."
6822,1957570,2.0,4.0,"I solemnly believe that if Tim had a TA that created tests based off of his lectures and graded said tests, Tim would be the best professor on this campus in terms of teaching you the material. I failed his dynamics class the first covid semester but I took it over summer and used his notes and got an 97 OVERALL. Tread lightly with Timmy."
6823,1957570,3.0,5.0,"His statics was a nightmare, but overall I will probably try to get into his dynamics class. 90% of the class will be failing by test 3, however, if you get a B or above on the final, he will pass you. He doesn't care if you know the material as the course goes on, he only cares that you know the material by the end of it. Solid but terrifying prof"
6824,1957570,1.0,4.0,Smart guy but amazingly awful professor. He doesn't teach the material at a level appropriate for the class. He works easy examples in class then puts insanely complex problems on the exam. He also has a very reptilian personality and seems to enjoy trying to humiliate or point out you mistakes in a manner that does nothing to benefit you. Skip him
6825,1957570,3.0,4.0,"Wanna pass Moore? 1. Go to all classes 2. Tests are similar to &quot;Suggested Problems&quot; and &quot;Class Examples.&quot; Know how to do these like the back of your hand and you will pass the tests. I did them all twice b4 the tests. 3. Go to his office hours, ask questions, and make him aware that you will work hard. He will answer your questions if you do this."
6826,1957570,4.0,5.0,"Moore Knows how to teach the material of the class in a way that if you understand what he is saying, you will understand the course and what is taught for the rest of your life, the biggest thing about Moore is that he is ridiculously hard. he's tough on you and is unforgiving, robots would think this guy is cold hearted sometimes."
6827,1957570,1.0,5.0,He belittled the class. He Leaves degrading remarks on test papers. Hands down the worst professor I have ever had my entire college career. Avoid at all cost.
6828,1957570,1.0,5.0,"Please, for the love of all things holy, don't take Professor Moore. Do everything in your power to take a different professor. He made my life a living hell, and I was just trying to pass. He's rude, disrespectful, and downright awful. I really wish I had never met this man. Save yourself now."
6829,1957570,4.0,5.0,"Be prepared to work for your grade. You will learn how to think about problems and apply your learned knowledge. Skipping class is not an option. Not doing the homework will set you up for failure. If you put in the work and actually show interest in the material you will be rewarded. Overall a wonderful professor, but boy are his classes hard."
6830,1957570,1.0,5.0,"Dont take Tim Moore if you care about your grade, your sanity, or your education. He is absolutely awful. Worse teacher I've ever had. Claims to care for students, but when you have questions about material you are met with his aggression, sarcasm, and or non-chalantness. The course isnt hard, he makes it hard. Dont take him at all costs."
6831,1957570,1.0,5.0,"Moore should not be teaching. He is mean, does not care about his students, and cannot convey things effectively at all. If you ask a question, he will yell at you and make you feel stupid."
6832,1957570,1.0,4.0,"Professor Moore is by far the worst professor I've had at MSU. He makes you believe that he cares about you and that he wants you to do well, when in reality, he couldn't care less. He gives a ton of practice problems, none for a grade. He barely answers emails, and when he does, they're vague and unhelpful. I 100% would not take him again."
6833,1957570,1.0,5.0,"Timothy Moore was without a doubt the hardest and worst teacher I had at MSU. He is super smart and know the materials thoroughly but he doesn't teach well at all, makes fun of you for most questions, works easy problems in class then gives very difficult exams and takes off points constantly. HOWEVER, if you go to his office he is quite helpful."
6834,1957570,1.0,5.0,"When I was free, I'll go to his office hours. I put in so much work for this class only to get an F. He made my semester miserable. Instead of trying to trick us on tests, he should focus more on actually teaching us so that we can understand. Just b/c you have knowledge, does not mean you know how to share knowledge."
6835,1957570,1.0,5.0,"Tim Moore is the absolute worst professor I've ever had at Mississippi State. He goes over easy examples in class, then expects us to be able to do the hardest possible examples after seeing easy ones once. The tests are the only grades you receive from this class, and he grades them ridiculously hard. Build your schedule around not taking him."
6836,1957570,2.0,5.0,"Tim Moore is hands down the hardest professor I've ever had. He does not care if you fail. He will take off points for everything that he possibly can. Your grade completely depends on how pissed off he gets while grading your exam. HOWEVER, he is very helpful if you go to his office hours. Good luck to all who take a Tim Moore course."
6837,1957570,2.0,5.0,"Grades extremely harshly, and constantly states that teachers in th epast were not hard enough on us, and that he needs to make up for that. Gives very little partial credit, and take off points for things such as lines not being straight, and using a different method from what he taught to solve a problem"
6838,1957570,1.0,5.0,"Hardest teacher Ive had. Gives easy examples in class, then homework problems that are hard and normally have incorrect solutions that he has to correct multiple times. The test questions are extremely hard and unfair. They can only be answered by engineering mastermind. Only way to pass is to go his office hours unless hes hunting which is often"
6839,1957570,4.0,4.0,"I took him Maymester, and he's very nice and helpful. You will have to show him that you care, and he will take care of you. He's not the same man that is described in previous ratings. People change. Don't take his class if you want an easy A. For the most part, I think his tests are easier than the suggested problems he gives us to work."
6840,1957570,5.0,4.0,"10/10 would recommend taking a class with him; One of the best engineering professors at MSU. Cares for his students and pushes them to work hard. The class in general is difficult, but he is really good at teaching and explaining the material. Dont skip class &amp; go to office hours."
6841,1957570,5.0,5.0,He will literally tell you if you take his class during the semester he will drag you over the coals. I took him during the summer and he was amazing. Go to his office and show him that you are willing to learn and he will help you out on grades in the end. He would come to the CE lounge and work problems outside of class.
6842,1957570,1.0,5.0,Timothy Moore is the hardest teacher Ive ever had. Continuously puts the entire class down and calls us stupid. Says the tests will be easy but 90% of us get a D or below then he gets mad about it. There is currently one A and one B in the class and he says hes fine with failing 23 students which is 90% of the class
6843,1957570,2.0,5.0,Oh boy here we go. I had him for Statics. He gives alot of very difficult homework which would be fine if he gave a hard example in class but his example are too easy. He says that's his strategy but if u don't know how to do the homework you won't be able to pass his test. Also has a very difficult personality but easier to talk to in office hours
6844,1957570,5.0,4.0,"Tim Moore is a tough teacher. He will drag you over the coals but if you go to class, DON'T USE CHEGG, and visit him during office hours he will be one of the best professors you will ever have. Trust me on the chegg thing he will find you and make you pay. Do homework, ask questions and show him your there to learn and he will take care of you."
6845,1957570,3.0,4.0,"Tim Moore is a solid choice if you are going into engineering. Otherwise, it'll be rough. He forces you to learn statics and breaks any laziness you had coming into this class. He is understanding, so long as you attend class. His first test will probably shock you but he will take care of is students."
6846,1957570,2.0,3.0,Difficult personality.
6847,1957570,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Moore will make you work hard but you will leave his class knowing your stuff. He is very willing to help, but you must ask. He expect you to be responsible and not entitled. Tough but truly cares and is a very interesting teacher. Study hard and go to class!"
6848,1957570,5.0,4.0,Love this professor. He has a bad reputation but if you show up to class and go to his office he is very helpful. There is a lot of homework but it really prepares you for the test. He really just expects his students to put in the effort and as long as you do you won't have any issues with him. He is a good teacher and has very detailed lectures.
6849,1957570,1.0,5.0,"Mr. Moore, what can I say?  He desperately needs to move over the MSU ed dept & take some of their 'learn to teach' classes! He doesn't know how to teach, he's mean, hateful & is only concerned with his personal life.  When it's going well then we are treated well when it's not then there's hell to pay!!!  I'm so thankful this is my last class!"
6850,1957570,2.5,4.0,"Timothy Moore. Where do I begin? This man is the worst teacher I've had in my entire life. I've never ever struggled in a class before, but I did in this one. Tim is a smart man, and a nice one at that. However he has no idea how to teach. He pretends his tests will be easy and will give you these ""hints"", but then he changes it. DO NOT TAKE HIM."
6851,1957570,2.5,5.0,"Had Dynamics & Vibrations with him. He knows the material, but he can not convey it well. On tests he will throw curve balls that end in low grades, then give a condescending spill on how the class isn't trying. He will help, but his office hour times are taken up by people needing help in all his classes. I'm Aerospace and wouldn't recommend him."
6852,1957570,5.0,4.0,"I took Tim for statics, dynamics and now I have him for Vibrations. He's in the Aerospace dept and he expects work to be clean and crisp as it should be. He lays out everything step by step but expects you to UNDERSTAND the material - His ""test tricks"" even simplify some problems if you know what you're doing. I definitely recommend if you're ASE."
6853,1957570,1.0,5.0,"Not only was this man one of the worst professor's I've ever had, he is the worst person I've ever met.  He threatened one lecture by saying, ""I will fail you if I think you are a menace to society."" It is quite a tragedy that Mississippi State allows this man to teach let alone step on campus, and I would absolutely avoid him for any class."
6854,1957570,2.0,5.0,"He wasted valuable class time telling us how stupid we are. He was condescending and mean the whole semester. After our last test, he emailed us and said he was ashamed at how many us didn't know basic math, when I know some people just made mistakes. He let his personal life affect his ability to do his job and lost interest towards the end"
6855,1957570,1.0,5.0,Tim Moore was the worst professor I've had in my whole career at Mississippi state. He is very full of himself. He would tell students what is supposed to be on the test then he will try to trick people and get angry when everyone gets it wrong.  I wouldn't suggest Tim Moore to anyone 
6856,1957570,4.5,2.0,"He's a good man. An if you do what he says then you'll pass with flying colors. It was his first semester teaching statics and he got better as the semester went on. Truly cares about the students. Made a D on the first test ... still came out with an A. If he knows you're working hard, you're in good shape. Studying your notes before every class."
6857,1957570,2.0,4.0,"He was the most unorganized teacher I've had, he constantly changed his mind the whole semester about the new material he was going to teach and upcoming assignments. Half of the things he would tell us, he would change his mind or ""forgot"" that he told us. I would not recommend him to anyone."
6858,2211522,1.0,5.0,Her class was extremely difficult for Spanish 1. The criteria was just way too hard. Im writing a review just to save anybody. Never take her. Even the mindtap assignments are really difficult.
6859,2211522,5.0,3.0,"You can only miss 3 classes but you won't want to miss it. Spanish is a class where you need to show up but the class itself is super laid back and fun. You will have about a hour of homework a night, like everyone else in a FL class, but it is easy. Tests are also easy if you do the practice tests she posts online. She's an awesome teacher."
6860,597699,1.0,3.0,Very poor communication skills...seemed to be judgmental when spoken to on a one on one basis
6861,597699,1.5,4.0,No Comments
6862,597699,2.0,3.0,Lazarou is unclear and can be unfair to some. Lectures are boring and uninformative. Never makes a good point and never sparks discussions. Gives programming assignments and doesn't seem to know what is going on &quot;behind the scenes.&quot; When asked for help he oftentimes just says to read a book on topic
6863,1007302,1.0,5.0,Don't take her!
6864,1007302,4.0,3.0,She is very helpful and nice to all students. If you have a problem with anything talk to her it pays off in the end.
6865,1007302,4.0,3.0,Dr. Thompson was tough she was extremely hard on grammar. She was a pretty good professor though but it was not easy getting through her class. Please talk when you are in there. It HELPS!!!!!
6866,1703622,2.0,5.0,"Stay on top of his assignments, and you will be okay. I personally had problems with his quizzes and found them hard, but the paper you will have to write for him will pull your grade up if you are a good writer. But skip a quiz, and you will be in a pickle."
6867,1703622,3.0,2.0,"He is an easy teacher, answers come directly from slides for his tests.Little work required for presentations but he is pretty easy"
6868,2727622,5.0,2.0,"He is always available for office hours and he makes his lectures interesting. You do have to write a lot but I would recommend just jotting down definitions and formulas. He recorded his lectures which were really useful to study. Test questions come from hw, practice questions, or review. If you want an A or B you will need to study."
6869,2727622,5.0,2.0,"This guy is awesome! You can tell he is passionate about what he does. You can tell he genuinely wants to see every student succeed in his class. If you have a question, he is going to help you with it, no matter what it takes. He is easily one of the best professors I have ever had, if not the best."
6870,2727622,4.0,2.0,"Great Professor! Went out of his way to remember each student's name. Very good at providing help when you don't understand the concepts. Plenty of extra credit opportunities, and relatively easy tests."
6871,2727622,5.0,2.0,"Great, caring teacher. Material isn't hard at all but you must be attentive at first. If you don't understand something he is great at explaining. Tests are also super easy. Extra Credit comes in a plethora."
6872,2727622,5.0,2.0,Take lots of notes and do the questions that he gives you because it will really help you on the test. He does give extra credit and he really does care what you make in his class. He even knows almost all his students names. You do not need a textbook but you will need to purchase Achieve.
6873,2211530,5.0,2.0,Actually the sweetest person I have ever met. Helps you create good speeches and cracks jokes. I'd love to have him as a professor again.
6874,2211530,3.0,3.0,"I had Professor Gardner for public speaking. He cares a lot about his students but I can't say he's really taught me that much. He also is older so he has a lot of opinions about things that you could call old-fashioned so be mindful of that. He tends to crack jokes during lectures, so that at least makes the class not completely boring."
6875,2211530,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Gardner is a great professor and is incredibly flexible, especially with regards to COVID. His criteria is super clear and tests/quizzes are straight from the book. Only complaint I have is that he is a bit biased in his grading of speeches - not terrible, but Id certainly write with his bias in mind (which reveals itself in class)."
6876,2211530,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Gardner is the best teacher I have had at MSU. He is very caring about his students and if you do the work he provides you will get an A. The only thing that kinda sucks about his class is that there is lengthy ready almost every night in his class, but the notes that you take from the reading you get to use on test/quizzes!"
6877,2211530,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Gardner is an awesome teacher! I highly recommend him if you have to take public speaking. Has daily quizzes and his tests are essay answers, but you can use your notes on them."
6878,2211530,5.0,1.0,"Danny is such a great person! We had a pizza party on the last day of class! Honestly, I was not excited about taking speech but i absolutly loved going! He makes class a safe space and everyone gets to interact. Im aquiet person but he made class an enjoyable time! Quizzes are super easy!! And u get to use notes for tests! The BEST professor ever!"
6879,2211530,5.0,4.0,"Probably the best public speaking professor at MSU! Hes a really nice man and gets to know you! Speeches are really easy and he lets you use your notes on quizzes and tests! When you say your speech, dont read it and dont go over the time limit!!"
6880,2211530,5.0,1.0,"This class can't be any easier. You have a quiz over each chapter but it is just vocab and you can use your notes. On tests, you can also use your notes. He grades speeches so easy, just don't go over the time limit.  He is also just a really cool guy and will write recommendation letters for you if ever needed. Easiest Public Speaking class ever!"
6881,2686666,5.0,1.0,"I loved having Poe for English Comp II. She is a really good teacher, and her class is enjoyable. There is a lot of writing, but that is to be expected for an English class. She always gives feedback and is good about clearly outlining what an assignment should be like. Definitely recommend!"
6882,597707,3.0,5.0,Economics is not my speciality so I have struggled in this class. Most of my classmates are not doing well either in her class. The only grades she takes are tests so there is no hope if you do not do well on them.
6883,597707,1.0,3.0,"A professor that was ""nice"" but was not one that presented the material well. Her tests did NOT reflect the material she presented in class. The tests were not exceptionally difficult but were not on material that was presented in class or from the reading outside of class. Very disappointed in this class."
6884,597707,3.0,3.0,"M.K. Thomas is a very passionate instructor, but she's very liberal and lets her opinions come through (especially in her upper level public finance courses).  Test material did not always reflect lecture material and she likes to give quizzes once a week."
6885,597707,3.0,5.0,Even though she's super nice. I was lost in economics. Barely passed so beware
6886,597707,1.0,5.0,She is HORRIBLE.
6887,597707,3.0,4.0,"No attendance, no hw - only a few tests. I always went to class, read the book, & studied, but I could barely scrape out a low A or B. She does not prepare you well. Nice lady, she shares interesting stuff; but it was harder than it should have been to pull out an A in an intro Econ. Don't just rely on classtime to help you pass this class. "
6888,597707,2.5,4.0,She doesn't teach what is going to be on the test.
6889,597707,2.5,5.0,"She tries to make class interesting, but does not get the information across to her students.  The tests are difficult."
6890,597707,5.0,2.0,great teacher
6891,597707,5.0,3.0,By far the best econ teacher at State
6892,597707,4.0,3.0,"yes, she does make it interesting, and she has a quirky sense of humor."
6893,597707,4.0,3.0,thank goodness this boring class has an interesting teacher
6894,597707,4.0,2.0,"Yeah, dont skip - but shes a good teacher."
6895,597707,4.5,2.0,"She doesn't take role, but she gives quizes alot.  WORK THE PRACTICE TESTS.  Overall, a good teacher and a fun class."
6896,597707,1.0,3.0,No Comments
6897,597707,1.0,5.0,she does not teach you what is going to be on the exam
6898,597707,2.0,3.0,No Comments
6899,597707,5.0,2.0,She speaks loud and clear in her lectures. Doesn't give homework problems. Gives weekly quizzes straight from the notes. Tells you exactly what you need to know for the quizzes and tests. Gives out helpful practice tests with answers before every test.
6900,2539222,1.0,4.0,"It takes enough time trying to understand the man, and once you do, you don't have enough time to do the work. Not to mention the extra required readings. It takes a certain skill to explain what you're doing properly and by God this man does not have it. Be careful of any mistakes in your work, because partial credit doesn't exist."
6901,2539222,1.0,5.0,"Would not recommend at all. Hardest tests and quizzes, grades homework very tightly. The whole class average was always below 65 still would not change the way he taught."
6902,2539222,5.0,3.0,Really great teacher that knows what they are talking about. Would recommend
6903,2031366,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Bogue seems like a really nice woman, but she cannot teach an online course. It takes her a minimum of a week to respond to an email, assignments go months without being graded, and her online &quot;lectures&quot; are no replacement for reading the textbook. Don't take her unless you're willing to read the book. The tests are also mostly essay-based."
6904,2031366,4.0,4.0,"Mrs. Bogue is a sweetheart. She genuinely cares and wants everyone to do well. The material of this class just sucked.  It wasnt the hardest thing ever, but wasnt the easiest either. It was a pretty fair class."
6905,2031366,3.0,3.0,Ms. Bogue is a very interesting teacher. The class is fairly easy as well as the material but she makes her test difficult. And she gives extra credit assignment and such but when it comes down to the grading; she makes up excuses for why she is not able to explain why you made the grade you were given. I think she is full of it in my opinion.
6906,2031366,4.0,2.0,I didn't like this class.  Mostly because of the material.  She's nice.  There isn't much work and if you do it you will get an A.
6907,2031366,3.0,5.0,"Patty Bogue is very nice, but a really hard grader. Her midterm and final was absolutely confusing and made no sense. She also barely counts the class work you do for hardly any points.  Very very hard to get an A in this class. I would not recommend this teacher if you're not prepared for a hard course. Hardest course I've taken."
6908,2031366,4.0,2.0,Genuinely cares about her students.  Very helpful if you ask for it and will meet outside of her office hours.  Responds to her emails very promptly.  Easy A if you show up and do your group work while in class. 
6909,2031366,4.0,2.0,She's a good teacher that genuinely cares about students.  You have to give speeches and do group projects but only one test. Easy A if you go and participate.  
6910,2735886,4.0,3.0,"Mrs. Leonard was really great. The class is easy because it's elementary math. The main goal is to teach us how to teach the material, and she does a good job at that. She is really nice and wants you to feel like you can ask questions. Test after every two chapters, homework on each section, quizzes that you use your homework on, and two projects."
6911,2735886,5.0,4.0,"I would recommend this professor to anyone planning to take Cal 1, especially if you tend to struggle with math. She is very clear when it comes to explanations during lectures, and even uses colored pens to help you follow her work. She wants you to succeed. This is still a tough class, though, so be prepared to put in the work!"
6912,2735886,5.0,4.0,"The class is a big class and one professor and she does amazing by helping if you need help she will help no matter what. She teaches well so areas I didnt like since I learned it a diff. way, but still does amazing. Have to get points in math domain almost every week but helps since there are tasks in there to help. Definitely would recommend."
6913,2735886,5.0,3.0,You do have to pay to use the program but she does a great job at explaining the problems and what you need to know/remember for them. Shes very sweet and especially for her first time teaching she did very well. I 100% recommend taking her for College Algebra. HW & Quiz every week + time at the math domain
6914,2735886,4.0,3.0,"As a visual learner, this teacher is helpful. You are able to preprint notes to bring to class. There is a bunch of homework and weekly quizzes but prepares you for tests. Along with this College Algebra class, you have to do the MYLAB (which is awful because I never had time to and is a HUGE part of your grade). Nice teacher and recommend her!"
6915,2735886,4.0,5.0,Absolutely hated this class not bc of the professor but because of the program she uses for our work and tests. Shes great though.
6916,1605391,5.0,4.0,The Best!!
6917,1605391,5.0,3.0,"Nordstrom is a great teacher! You have ample opportunity to do well in the Weather and Climate class.  I do think the quizzes and midterms could be a little more difficult. However, this course is mixed with students from varying backgrounds.  So I think the course content is fair given that info. I can't wait to take a course with Nordstrom again!"
6918,1605391,5.0,3.0,Greg Nordstrom is a fantastic educator. he's easy to understand and very helpful. He also sets very clear expectations and guidelines.
6919,1605391,5.0,3.0,I had several classes at MSU with Professor Nordstrom and I enjoyed each one. Hes a laid back guy that teaches meteorology without boring you and makes sure you understand the material. He is also quick to respond to emails.
6920,1605391,5.0,3.0,Will gladly chat about class material or other material outside of the scope of the course. Responds to emails 24/7. Will help with coursework. Absolute weather fanatic.
6921,1605391,5.0,3.0,The Best! Really knows his stuff.
6922,1605391,5.0,2.0,"This class isn't difficult, but you must show up. Most of the information should be fairly straightforward, particularly if you are grasping meteorology concepts in your other classes. Do NOT skip forecast blogs, or your grade will suffer."
6923,1605391,5.0,3.0,Makes the class fun.  Always available to help with prompt responses.  Great teacher!
6924,1605391,5.0,4.0,Best teacher I ever had!  A ++
6925,1605391,4.5,4.0,"Good guy, very helpful."
6926,1605391,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Nordstrom is a great teacher.  I have learned a lot in his classes!!  If you are failing Intro to Met (GR 1603), that's on you.  We are talking basic algebra here.  NOT HARD!  Considering the way people complain these days, I don't know how Mr. Nordstrom does it.  I know I couldn't.  We need more teachers like him!"
6927,1605391,1.0,5.0,Tough tough. 
6928,1605391,2.0,5.0,"To be honest, he was a horrible professor when it came down to the Distance Learning Prg. It was hard to follow him b/c he taught math equations from a powerpoint and didn't explain things well and He does have an attitude. He will assume that you are not understanding the course if he can't help you. However, he will answer all your questions"
6929,1605391,5.0,1.0,"I think Greg is an unbelievable GOOD teacher. He takes time to help and figure out if you have a problem. I'm an international student- and he really makes the class fun!! Its sometimes hard in english, but he makes it easier! :-)"
6930,1605391,5.0,4.0,Very great teacher and very helpful!
6931,1605391,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Nordstrom is the best teacher I have ever had in my life!  His passion really shows.  You can tell he loves to teach.  ALWAYS available for help, even on weekends.  The only people that complain are the ones that don't want to work/learn.  Highly recommend his class!"
6932,1605391,1.0,3.0,"Would never take his class again.  Very difficult to follow, adds his own material and it's not accurate.  Also rude to students."
6933,1605391,2.0,3.0,"Yeap, nice from far but far from nice"
6934,1466141,5.0,3.0,"In my opinion a lot of the class was conversation with partners, I enjoyed the class overall though, the material was explained well and quizzes felt very easy to me. Shes a super nice and great professor overall and offers a lot of insight in my opinion, I would definitely take her class again if I could."
6935,1466141,5.0,2.0,"Great class, you will definitely learn Spanish!"
6936,1466141,5.0,2.0,"I took Dr. Moser for Spanish II. She is the best online lecturer I've ever had. Her classes were engaging, and she genuinely is so kind to students. The class had a lot of homework assignments and quizzes, but those help to make sure you get practice with the language. I could not recommend her more to Spanish students!"
6937,1466141,5.0,1.0,I had this class online because of Covid and it was really easy if you're somewhat knowledgeable in Spanish. She's a really sweet teacher and the assignments aren't difficult by any means.
6938,1466141,5.0,2.0,"The best Spanish teacher I've ever had! Super sincere and caring, she really gets to know you and it's evident. She's funny and also loves to have fun, even class is fun! She will make sure you pass."
6939,1466141,5.0,2.0,Amazing teacher! Very down to earth and very helpful!
6940,827175,5.0,2.0,"Best teacher in Civil Engineering dept.  Took Steel Structures Design course and made an A.  Provides excellent printed notes.  Significant homework, but it is all relevant.  Tough but fair.  Excellent teacher!"
6941,827175,2.0,5.0,this old coot was hard as hell he loved talking about rabbits and beer and cookies the homework was long the tests were hard and he was just annoying
6942,2154281,5.0,2.0,Mr. Montgomery made it very clear what you needed to do and when you needed to do it to pass. He is very funny and sweet in his lectures. He also responds to emails very quickly and will try to work with you whenever he can.
6943,2154281,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Montgomery is the kindest prof. you could ever have. The class was kinda boring, but I think that may be because I'm a 3rd year SO student taking a 1st level SO class so it just seemed repetitive. Would recommend him if you need an SO class or a religion class (I took that with him as well)."
6944,2154281,5.0,1.0,Easiest class I've ever taken. Bert always made the lectures interesting and the material isn't hard at all. I stopped going to class halfway through the semester and still finished with a 98
6945,2154281,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Montgomery is always simultaneously captivating and entertaining. He always approaches loaded sociological topics from a very objective and scientific standpoint. The class itself is not difficult in the slightest, but it is a prime learning experience. Grades consist solely of 10 multiple choice online quizzes and three take home exams."
6946,2154281,5.0,1.0,Mr. Montgomery is a great teacher take class for a easy A. Hes good at what he does and cracks jokes and cares a lot for his students you meet him halfway and hell meet you. I didnt submit a quiz probably 2 weeks overdue and he let me do it. Also cancels class so be sure to check canvas before going.
6947,2154281,5.0,2.0,I 10/10 recommend taking his classes. Mr. Montgomery is and amazing professor. He genuinely cares for his students and is truly passionate about what he does. He explains the material very well in ways that help you understand. His class is not hard at all but you still learn easily. One of my favorite classes Ive ever taken.
6948,2154281,5.0,2.0,Bert Montgomery is one of my most favorite professors of all time. He genuinely cares for his students and cares about what he is teaching. I'm trying to take him again as soon as possible.
6949,2154281,4.0,2.0,"There were 10 quizzes (100), very easy, an attendance grade (100) and then 4 tests Final is optional I got an A and all I did was listen to the audiobook and the powerpoints for the test. Bert is just a great guy and he is so passionate about what he teaches BEWARE there was an issue w people scanning in &amp; leaving; one day we did written attendance"
6950,2154281,5.0,3.0,"I LOVE Bert Montgomery. He has the most interesting lectures and he ties religion into other things such as football, Harry Potter, and other pop culture to bridge gaps and create parallels. He is incredibly interesting and cares for his students. No electronic devices and mandatory attendance, but even with that I would take him again."
6951,2154281,5.0,2.0,"The grade consists of 4 tests, weekly quizzes, &amp; attendance. If you don't have more than 1 unexcused absence, you get 100 free points. Quizzes are online &amp; based straight from the textbook, which you can use while taking them. Tests are not that hard, but do require studying. Overall, this is a good class to take, and he makes it interesting."
6952,2154281,4.0,2.0,"Loved taking Mr. Bert for intro to religion! I found it very interesting and he is pretty funny and entertaining. There are options for extra credit. If you do not miss more than one class, you get a free 100 grade, that is the ONLY reason I ended up with a B. Don't miss more than once!"
6953,2154281,2.0,2.0,"Overall, the class was pretty easy compared to my other classes. Montgomery is a nice guy, but his lectures are all over the place and extremely boring. I am NOT one to fall asleep in class and everyday I caught myself dozing off. Nothing he says in the lecture is on the test, but attendance is mandatory. READ. THE. BOOK."
6954,417604,5.0,5.0,"Dr. John Mylroie is a wonderful instructor of Geology. His lectures are amazing, funny, interesting and beneficial. No time for favoritism from this man, as he judges his students on their merit. His love for the Bahamian Island of San Salvador is evident in his 13 day field class to the Island. His intelligence is Hot!"
6955,417604,5.0,1.0,Awesome teacher! Interesting geology!
6956,417604,5.0,3.0,"great job with field courses,  only requires average fitness unlike other respondents claim.  I truely appreciate the need to access the examples of structures first hand and this requires a bit of work.  he is passionate about his work."
6957,417604,4.5,3.0,Always fun.  Dude is wild and knows his stuff.  You'll do fine as long as you at least do the weekly homeworks he knows that everyone isn't a science major.
6958,417604,3.5,3.0,"Excellent.  His unique style challenges the way you think, and makes you observe, and then interpret what you observe.  The caves were amazing."
6959,417604,4.5,3.0,One of the department's best instructors!  Homework assignments are relevant to course material and preparation for class is key to success.  Very approachable and will to help.
6960,417604,4.5,4.0,As good as they get!
6961,417604,5.0,4.0,"Had for water resources & oceanography. Homework every week, must have text book. Not easy, but great class I learned alot, he cracks alot of jokes and grades on a curve"
6962,417604,5.0,2.0,"Worked with in the field on San Sal, Bahamas.  Excellent instructor!  The learning experience will stay with me forever!"
6963,417604,4.5,3.0,"Great instructor.  Interesting, knowledgeable, and very helpful inside and outside of class."
6964,417604,5.0,4.0,Learned more in 10 days in the caves than I could have in 10 years in the classroom. He is an outstanding educator
6965,417604,5.0,4.0,Professor knows a great deal of science and can get his point across with ease! Great professor!
6966,417604,2.0,3.0,very annoying teaching style. he just reads text from the books and then tries to show us how smart he is.

6968,2711373,5.0,3.0,She was one of my favorite professors at MSU. She truly cares about her students. Her lectures and projects were really interesting. I really enjoyed this class and wish she offered more classes!
6969,2817871,5.0,3.0,"Despite what others are saying, it's an interesting class if you pay attention! He's a very understanding professor, and will work with you within reason. I highly recommend taking this class!"
6970,2817871,5.0,3.0,He's awesome and really cares about his students!
6971,2817871,5.0,2.0,"he is great, he make jokes and it is a very fun and easy class environment"
6972,2817871,5.0,2.0,He is Excellent 
6973,2817871,3.0,1.0,"You can't understand a thing he says, but you don't need to. Got an A in this class by just going for attendance and doing other work in the class. The easiest A you will ever get. The quizzes and test are all online. Take this class"
6974,2817871,4.0,1.0,Very easy class
6975,2817871,2.0,1.0,Very difficult to understand. He digresses ALOT. Easy class if you do the homework. 
6976,909153,2.0,5.0,"Not a bad lecturer, however not the nicest guy either. You would be better off going to google if you need help in his class. "
6977,909153,1.0,5.0,Will never take him again. He does not seem to care about teaching.
6978,909153,3.0,4.0,He's tough but fair. You will get the grade you earn.
6979,909153,1.0,5.0,"Awful teacher. I had to use you tube and Google in order to understand. When I visited him for help during his office hours, he still was no help. Instead I left feeling belittled. He told our entire class that our problem wasn't his teaching but we were pacified by the previous professor. Truth be told I actually learned better from the previous."

6982,622438,1.0,5.0,IF U ARE SMART DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS MAY B THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE...
6983,622438,4.0,2.0,"Mrs. Fulton is sweet. Like a grandmother. She taught high school forever, and her class is like it. easy A"
6984,622438,2.5,4.0,I hated this class more than anything. It was horrible. She loves busy work!!!
6985,622441,1.0,4.0,Take anyone else if you can
6986,622441,3.0,5.0,"Went into this class unaware of how hard it was going to be. Mrs Bogard is a good teacher, but her grading is incredibly tough. Im not an unintelligent person, but I wasnt anywhere near ready for this class. I think she worked very hard to help, but this class isnt for anyone that isnt incredible at research and writing."
6987,622441,5.0,3.0,one of the nicest teachers I have ever had!
6988,622441,2.0,5.0,She is a nice person overall but is a very tough grader. She once gave me feedback saying that I was not trying enough for her. I wrote what she wanted three times and she still was not satisfied. She expects everyone to be more academically advanced in their writing. Only take her if you are excellent at research and grammar
6989,622441,5.0,4.0,Definitely one of the best teachers I've ever taken. Go to class and do your readings (and online journals) and you will pass. She takes no excuses and does not give extra credit so don't skimp on anything. Make sure you write a lot for the online journals bc she will count off for short answers.
6990,622441,4.0,5.0,"She is a good teacher, but her class was really hard for me. I think my writing has improved from this class though. We had journals almost every M/W/F and they're homework but pretty simple. She grades papers hard and takes a long time to grade but she will help you personally if you ask. No tests in her class, just papers (including the final)."
6991,622441,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Bogard was a wonderful teacher, but more importantly a great person. She is very personable and willing to review essays. The more you go to her office hours the better you will do on your essays. There is, no doubt, a direct correlation."
6992,622441,5.0,4.0,She is an excellent teacher. Very funny and charismatic. I would 10/10 take her again if I could. She does not mess around with people who don't do their work. Write a lot on the journals and try your best on the papers and you'll pass with a good grade.
6993,622441,5.0,2.0,"She is super nice and her class is really easy! She has ""reading quizzes"" just about every day, so attendance matters."
6994,622441,5.0,1.0,"Ms. Bogard is my favorite professor so far in my 2 years at MSU. She is hilarious and kind, and her class is incredibly fun. There is lots of reading and writing involved of course, but nothing too difficult. Definitely sign up for her class if you can."
6995,622441,5.0,4.0,She is an incredible professor and just a great person overall. The atmosphere in her classroom was always welcoming. The only grades are papers and journals on textbook readings but it is not a hard class if you put in the effort.
6996,622441,4.0,3.0,Great teacher and is very passionate about what she teachers! Would recommend but sometimes she is a tough grader and takes forever to grade papers.
6997,622441,5.0,3.0,Amazing teacher! Makes reading interesting and helps students apply it to every day life.
6998,622441,4.0,2.0,"I love this teacher! Her class is fun, and we always have great discussions. She encourages participation. She is always willing to give out bonus points here and there. She does give ""pop"" reading quizzes, but she usually warns you when they are coming. Easy and fun class with a great teacher."
6999,622441,5.0,2.0,"It is Accelerated Comp; so, there is a ton of writing. However, if you go to class, pay attention and, do your work, it is an easy class."
7000,622441,3.5,3.0,"Accelerated Comp 2. Definitely not an easy A, but not impossible. You need to go to class. You have to write 2 big papers and then one huge research paper for the final. And you have about 12 journal entries on material you have read. She's funny and helpful if you ask! I never did. Not easy but worth the credit for 2 comp classes.  "
7001,622441,5.0,2.0,Love Ms. Bogard! Always willing to help if you go to her office and explains things very well in class. If you read what you're supposed to and take notes you'll be set for the tests! Great teacher!!!
7002,622441,5.0,3.0,Excellent teacher! The best I've had since I've been at Mississippi State!
7003,622441,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher, knows what she is talking about, grades your essays hard but helps you understand what your doing wrong."
7004,622441,5.0,2.0,engaging
7005,622441,3.5,3.0,"Lot of work, but not too hard."
7006,622441,5.0,2.0,Great teacher. Doesn't grade too hard and will help you with anything you need. As long as you read the stories and do your papers you'll do fine.
7007,622441,5.0,4.0,Good Teacher
7008,622441,5.0,2.0,She is a really good teacher and knows what she is talkin about
7009,622441,5.0,5.0,THE BEST TEACHER AT STATE! I LOVE THIS WOMEN!
7010,2310003,4.0,3.0,Great professor for American government. Wants you to pass and will answer questions. do not cheat by using Quizlet. she will make the homework harder for you. Chapter homework each week. Really funny and cares about what she is teaching. Does not post lecture notes online so take notes. Gives you bonus questions. Test are easy if you study. Easy A
7011,2310003,5.0,1.0,Great teacher and great class. Highly recommended
7012,2310003,5.0,2.0,She is an amazing teacher and person!! She makes class interesting. All of the tests and homework are online through mindtap and blackboard. She gives plenty of bonus points and is very helpful!! She will even help you with other subjects or if you have a crappy adviser. Definitely take her if you can!!
7013,2310003,5.0,2.0,"BEST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD!! Everything is online (test , quiz, homework). She is extremely helpful. Test match lectures. Gives lost of bones points through participation. Loves to tell stories! Show up to class, take notes, do homework assignments and you will pass no problem."
7014,2310003,4.0,2.0,Easy A definitely would take again
7015,2310003,4.0,1.0,"EXTREMELY easy A. Miss Harris is hilarious, and she really knows her stuff. Class is very interesting, and we always talk about relative topics. If something interesting happens in the American government, she will postpone lecture to talk about it and keep her students up to date."
7016,2310003,4.0,3.0,"This isn't a hard class (although sort of boring), and she offers bonus sometimes in the form of an optional paper. Exams are online. You need to read the book to do well. You can google stuff but not everything is easy to find. Prof doesn't care if you come to class but DON'T leave during lectures. If you take her, READ THE BOOK."
7017,2580351,5.0,4.0,My absolute favorite professor in the social work department! 
7018,2580351,5.0,3.0,She can be hard to reach over email so the best thing is to talk to her in class or go to her office. Shes so funny though and will take her again.
7019,745346,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Herb, the predecessor to lil herb."
7020,745346,2.0,5.0,"yeah he's nice, but don't let that fool you. he's tough! and not really understanding of the fact that you might not be a drawing major."
7021,745346,4.5,3.0,"come to class, participate and try. he is a really nice guy and he wants you to have fun. really funny and nice."
7022,745346,4.5,2.0,"HERB IS AWESOME If you try, you'll be fine. Ask for help if you need it, because he's awesome and will help you any way he can! Such a funny dude man, awesome guy"
7023,745346,4.5,3.0,Herb's the man. I don't think i've been in that class yet without laughing.
7024,745346,4.0,4.0,Mr. Herb will challenge you but he's also pretty lax. He’s always in a good mood and he gives off a relaxed atmosphere. He'll gladly explain anything but in a very abstract way so you often have to read between the lines to know what he’s talking about. And there’s often an assignment due every class meeting.
7025,2826127,4.0,1.0,"Professor Lofton is a very good teacher. He provides lots of in-class homework. He lectures very little but uses powerpoints. This class consists of writing about 6 or 7 papers usually around 4 pages each. Textbooks are required and used almost every day in class. If you miss a day of class, you do not get to make up the work you missed."
7026,2129809,1.0,4.0,The worst teacher i have ever had. Literally take anyone else. Calls you out and makes you feel dumb 
7027,2129809,1.0,4.0,"if you dont like to participate dont take this. we meet every wednesday from 4pm-6:30pm. 2 tests, 2 papers, homework and in class quiz every week. the quizzes are at the end of each lecture and are password protected. he is very rude. if you have to take philosophy, choose another teacher. "
7028,2129809,5.0,4.0,Logic was very hard for me; Dr Johnson was always available to help. He would sometimes meet at the last minute. Meetings were via web-ex. He understands the difficulty of his class and wants his students to do well. I wish all professors cared as much as he does! I do NOT recommend logic but I highly recommend Dr. Greg.
7029,2129809,5.0,4.0,"I have had him for multiple classes. His classes are challenging, but they do not have to be difficult if you actually read the material and keep up with the syllabus. If you want to slack off, this is not the professor to take. He is accessible, and he provides some pretty solid feedback."
7030,2129809,3.0,3.0,"Make sure you get the book and read it. If you do not read the book then you will fail the class. You also have to write three papers, be aware that you will hardly get feedback so really do not know what he is looking for"
7031,2129809,4.0,3.0,"His online class was fine, I found. Some of his assignments can come across as offensive, but he tries to make you have an open mind to all possibilities--which is what you sign up for. He never took more than a day to respond to my emails and always had very clear feedback. He's a pretty decent online instructor."
7032,2129809,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this class... This man grades tough. You will write a paper about your thoughts on a subject, YOUR OPINION, and he will still grade as if you are wrong. The discussions are not bad, as long as you do the readings which are extremely long and make no sense. Save yourself some heartache and take another humanities elective."
7033,1064854,5.0,1.0,Awesome! So much fun!
7034,1064854,5.0,4.0,Great teacher!  Makes learning fun and relates it to your profession!!
7035,1941432,2.0,4.0,I took this class last summer and it was pretty difficult. The professor went too fast and I felt that most of the class was lost. One of the exams most of the class failed so there was a major curve. I would recommend taking this class during a full semester as going to lab everyday was the major downfall of the class.
7036,1941432,4.0,4.0,"To start this off I took this class in the summer before my freshman year which was a mistake. It was nothing Outlaw did, it was just really fast paced, especially with me never being in college before w having other classes. Since it was summer we just had 4 tests, no final. He also did extra credit quizzes every Thursday. Would be better in fall"
7037,1941432,4.0,3.0,"Uses slides for lecture, but posts them online. Attendance is not part of the grade. 5 tests but only counts 4 (the 5th is the final which is optional)."
7038,1941432,5.0,2.0,"I missed 15 days of Outlaw's lecture. I got an A in the class. I studied for every test (he puts his PowerPoints online) and never missed a lab, and took the optional final. The final uses the most correctly answered questions from past exams. If you put in effort it's an easier class than most."
7039,1941432,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Outlaw is very friendly and clearly wants his students to succeed. Attendance is not mandatory, but sometimes he says things in class that are not on the slides. I went to class every day because the lectures were not boring, and he also gives extra credit quizzes."
7040,1941432,4.0,2.0,"Super easy lecture, posts lectures slides, gives bonus point quiz before each exam, and cancelled class a few times. Ask questions in class! He doesn't try to rush through all the scheduled chapters before an exam. Go to SI to review, especially before exams. Old Quizlets are super helpful to study for exams! Optional final really helps!"
7041,1941432,4.0,4.0,Positives: - Knows the course material very well and he is always willing to give extra help when needed. -Occasional comedy in class -No homework/papers/etc. Only tests -Bonus points from pop quizzes -Enthusiastic about the material Cons: -Moves relatively quickly -Somewhat long/challenging tests Pro/Con: He canceled class a few times
7042,1941432,5.0,1.0,"EASY class. if you've ever taken a basic bio course, even in high school, this should be a breeze. He's a fun, nice guy who will help you out if you need it. Super chill. Gives &quot;pop quizzes&quot; for extra points on tests-- highest he gave us was 12 extra points. great guy."
7043,1941432,4.0,2.0,He is a good teacher that wants you to do well. The tests are so much easier if you actually just go to class. He teaches off a powerpoint and the notes are easy. Just memorize. The tests can sometimes be tricky but overall its an easy science. He gives extra credit pop quizzes and an optional final that can replace your lowest test grade
7044,1941432,4.0,3.0,I took his plants and humans class.. its a non major science class and i honestly thought it was a good easy science class to take. He does a 10 point extra credit quiz before each test(4 +optional final). I got As and Bs on every test. His lectures are actually good because he likes the subject and knows what he's talking about. WOULD recommend.
7045,1941432,5.0,3.0,"I'm not sure why so many people have negative things to say about him. I felt like he was a fair professor and gave many extra opportunities throughout the semester. Your grade is comprised of 4 tests and your lab grade. The tests aren't super easy, but if study the lecture slides you should do fine. I didn't buy the textbook and got an A."
7046,1941432,1.0,5.0,"He's all over the place, test questions are confusing and make the test harder than they have to be."
7047,1941432,4.0,4.0,"Not the best, but not the worse either. He does make you work for your grade, for instance, studying the notes he places online and reading the book is essential.. He tests on just having a basic understanding of the material. Plus, there is only four test and a final (optional). Does extra credit too, 10 possible points each, added to final score."
7048,1941432,1.0,5.0,"This guy is really snarky when I go in for help.  He acts like after one time of him explaining something that you should know everything about that concept.  His test are extremely hard and there is little to no extra credit in his classes. For His last test, the grade average was a 68. I would take absolutely anyone else."
7049,1376201,2.0,1.0,"Class is not difficult at all. Half way pay attention in lectures and turn in original work on time. However he is not a very nice guy. He called several people in class out for different reasons, and seemed to enjoy embarrassing them each time. Seems to respect you much more if you agree/think like him. So if you do not agree, fake it like I did."
7050,1376201,5.0,2.0,"Attendance isn't graded but there are several questions asked that is graded to make up a participation score. Recitation on Fridays are led by TA and are just for conversation, but there is a participation grade there too. Assignments include weekly readings (which you can skip and still be fine), worksheets, video reactions and one easy essay."
7051,1376201,5.0,1.0,super easy class to pass as long as you show up. The grade you make truly depends on the TA but its a super easy course.
7052,1376201,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Hoffman can for sure come across as a jerk; just know if he picks on you, its because he likes you. He is intimidating, but if you go up and talk to him, hes pretty chill. Go to class and take notes more on what he says then what the slides say. Also, he does give random extra credit opportunities."
7053,1376201,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Hoffman was a solid professor. Overall, the course wasn't that hard if you apply yourself and take good, organized notes. His tests aren't too bad, and they were open note but the time frame given to take the exams was the worst part. He is a good professor, and cares about his students. This is a genuine, unbiased response so take my advice :)"
7054,1376201,1.0,1.0,"Very easy, however David Hoffman lives to be condescending during class. He finds enjoyment picking on his students for no reason. I think he has no other happiness in his life so he shows up to class trying to take away ours."
7055,1376201,3.0,4.0,"I loved this class, and I learned a lot. He can be hard on grading. I missed an A just barely because he grades differently than what shows on Canvas. He offers extra credit and gives several reminders at the beginning of class. Tests were typically hard but. The recitation for this class was so much fun."
7056,1376201,4.0,3.0,Hes a solid teacher. Pretty passionate about what hes talking about. Just take notes and youll be fine.
7057,1376201,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Hoffman is great lecturer and makes this class really enjoyable. There are a few papers and three exams as well as reading outside of class. It is a decent amount of work, but if you put the effort in you can get an A. He also offers lots of extra credit opportunities."
7058,1376201,1.0,4.0,David is very rude. Be careful if you want to speak because he will say things that might hurt your feelings. He is the type of teacher who enjoys belittling people. Make sure to take notes from the power point. The readings are pointless. The info he teaches is also incorrect depending on your religious beliefs. I HIGHLY do not recommend.
7059,1376201,2.0,4.0,This is definitely not an easy class.. don't depend on his slides he posts because they are really bad and not helpful. and don't open your mouth or even think about speaking in his class because he will go off. he has a very short temper and likes to make his class a lot of work
7060,1376201,5.0,4.0,"I'm biased because he and I get along well, but I loved his classes! He definitely makes you work for it, and he will not hold your hand. You are expected to do the work in his classes, or at least put forth a real effort. If you need help with the readings, ask him! If you don't understand something, ask! He's very passionate and will help you!"
7061,1376201,1.0,3.0,VERY RUDE. HORRIBLE PERSON. WILL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE WORTH NOTHING.
7062,1376201,4.0,4.0,I took Hoffman's Intro to Cultural Anthropology course. If you were not interested in anthropology this course will not be as great for you. This is not a course you take for fun. Hoffman expects you to work for your grade.  He offers extra credit throughout the semester. He is extremely friendly and provides reference of pop culture to his lecture
7063,1376201,5.0,4.0,"Great professor who is very passionate about what he teaches. Uses small groups as well as large lectures to fully cover material. Gets students involved in discussion, and assigns cool projects and readings that aren't too hard, but will make you think."
7064,1376201,4.5,3.0,Hoffman's class was not hard if you studied the material and read the assigned readings. There are quizzes almost every class period based on the readings due that day. The two major projects were really easy. He engages the class and tries to make it interesting. All in all it was a good class.
7065,1376201,3.0,3.0,"Professor Hoffman requires that you read large portions of text for each class and then write discussion questions that correlate.  That is perfectly fine and interesting, however he becomes verbally aggressive if students do not engage in class discussions.  I changed my minor because of his negative and rude behavior while teaching."
7066,1376201,2.0,5.0,"There were alot of readings that did not go along with the class. The tests were not only hard but too long. I believe in constructive criticism but he dishes out hardcore criticism for papers, etc."
7067,1376201,3.0,4.0,"Gives pop quizes on a regular basis, so make sure you do the readings. Go to the two review sessions before the tests. They're very helpful. Make sure you don't come into class late or without a written excuse. He will not let you take a quiz or make up any work without a legit excuse. Overall, the class is interesting."
7068,2441171,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Hill is not a very engaging professor, and her lectures aren't particularly helpful because she just reads off the slides, but if you'll tab your textbook and organize your notes, her tests are very fair. The homework is challenging and takes several hours, but its only 10% of your grade and she'll answer any questions you have in office hours."
7069,2441171,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Hill reads the slides every single class period. Her slides are just the text of the thermo book. She has examples in her notes (the ones from the book) but she rarely ever goes over those. The tests are just a guessing game of whether you can find the equation because it is open book and open notes. My advice is, take it with someone else."
7070,2383835,1.0,3.0,"He is not your ideal professor. He has such a snobby attitude everytime you ask him a question he always have unnecessary smart remarks. Make sure you do well on the first exam because he doesn't do extra credit, drop grade or anything. Just homework and participation.  He's not very helpful outside of class either if you have a question. "
7071,2383835,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Welch's Evolution class isn't terribly difficult. He hands out study guides for every lecture, so fill in those during the class, as the lecture slides are only outlines. His review sessions before exams are very helpful. If a student attends class and takes plenty of notes, they should have no problem receiving an A or B in the course. "
7072,2383835,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Welch is a really nice guy and an awesome teacher. He makes his lectures fun and has a passion for what he's teaching. However, he gave us a study guide EVERY lecture with 10-20 questions on them and they didn't help me for the tests at all. The tests were hard and he words the questions to make them confusing. Cool guy, not cool tests."
7073,2383835,4.0,4.0,There were complaints about this professor from people who did not want to do the bare minimum. But if you simply do his homework and quizzes and ask him questions in class he is very helpful and explains anything you need clarification on for the test. Take good notes and do the practice problems and youll get an A!
7074,2383835,3.0,3.0,"It was his first time teaching this class. Test were very similar to practice problems and quizzes, and will work all of the problems from both in class. Test were online and open notes."
7075,2383835,1.0,5.0,This teacher is the worst ive ever had at state. He made us watch lecture videos outside of class time while also having quizes and homework. When he tried to explain things in class it didn't seem like he knew what he was talking about. He talked to us like we were experts on genetics. He never gave us the answers so we didnt know if we were right
7076,2383835,2.0,5.0,This class is among the hardest I've ever taken but not the hardest. It is hard to get into contact with him and the tests are hard and require a lot of application. Attendance is graded but you get a few absent days. Homework is somewhat graded by completion. Lectures can drag but he tries to be as interesting as possible. Have to buy the HW code.
7077,2605046,5.0,4.0,"Mrs. Bashford is honestly a great teacher and I thoroughly enjoyed her class. She understands what its like to be a student and that the material is difficult. In her lessons she often askes for question and clearly explains answers in a way that makes perfect sense. She is also funny, and always lightens up the mood of the class. I recommend 100%"
7078,2605046,1.0,4.0,Poor lectures. Does not explain things well. Some of her answers are incorrect. Limited study material. She does the bare minimum. Expect to seek additional tutoring.
7079,2605046,1.0,4.0,"Ms. Bashford is easily one of the worst professors I have ever had. She works examples in class that is nothing like the homework. Also, her review for tests does not help you very much. All of her tests have 11 questions so if you make a couple of mistakes and get a few wrong, you have failed the test. If you want to do well, attend every SI."
7080,2605046,5.0,4.0,Very organized. Released the assignments and quizzes so you could move ahead if you wanted to. Was available for questions. Explained tough problems well.
7081,835574,5.0,3.0,"Well organized class.  He was extremely helpful and I really learned alot.  This was the first Distance MBA class I took and after taking more, wish more of the professors would have been this organized."
7082,835574,3.0,5.0,"He's a fun professor, and really puts alot into the class, but his homework assignments take a very long time to do. His tests also take up the entire period, or more. They are all short essay/graph. They aren't off-the-wall-small-details-important-when-did-we-do-that&#63; hard, but you do have to know your subject. (and write fast about it)"
7083,835574,5.0,1.0,One of the most organized courses of the MBA program.  Very informative class.
7084,835574,4.5,4.0,Very good but challenging class. The homework assignments were very time consuming.

7087,2359293,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Allison is an amazing and knowledgeable professor. You can tell that she really enjoys what she's teaching. As long as you show up, pay attention, and ask questions to understand the material, you'll do fine. She really expects you to do your best on the homework, and though the assignments are long, they aren't excruciatingly difficult."
7088,2359293,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Allison is one of the nicest professors on campus. You can tell she is extremely intelligent. I actually enjoyed her class. We had a journal entry due everyday, but they were SO. EASY. Only bad thing is that she is a very hard grader on the assigned papers. she expects you to try your best, and if you dont.. she WILL call you out on it."
7089,2359293,3.0,1.0,"I took quidditch with her, she is all about gender equality which can be a good thing, but took it overboard a little. Just do your journal every other week and go to class and it is an easy A. I recommend quidditch for a freshman 1 hour course for sure if you enjoy physical activity. Not as embarrassing as you would think"
7090,2359293,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Allison is great. You didn't just memorize terms in there like a regular sociology class. She gives you a sociological view of the world. I recommend reading the chapters from the book before you go to class. You'll be lost if not. As long as you do that and pay attention in class, you should do well on the tests. Plus she did't give a final!"
7091,2359293,1.0,5.0,"If you don't have to take this class for credit, DO NOT TAKE IT. If you have to take it for credit, I'm so sorry. For an introductory course, it's near impossible. She's one of those people who speaks to students like she would speak to someone in her field of equal education. The homework is impossible. You won't make over a 6/10, I promise."
